[
# 2159 Applicability Date Provisions and Determining
 Whether an Application Is Subject to the First Inventor To File Provisions of the
 AIA [R-11.2013]


Because the changes to **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** in the AIA apply only to
 specific applications filed on or after March 16, 2013, determining the effective filing
 date of a claimed invention for purposes of applying **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** provisions or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** provisions is critical.
 



# 2159.01 Applications Filed Before March 16,
 2013 [R-11.2013]


The changes to **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** in the AIA do not apply to any
 application filed before March 16, 2013. Thus, any application filed before March 16,
 2013, is governed by **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** (i.e., the application is a
 pre-AIA first to invent application). Note that neither the filing of a request for
 continued examination, nor entry into the national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**,
 constitutes the filing of a new application. Accordingly, even if a request for
 continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322625)** is filed on or after
 March 16, 2013, in an application that was filed before March 16, 2013, the application
 remains subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. Similarly, a PCT application
 filed under **[35
 U.S.C. 363](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306994313)** before March 16, 2013, is subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, regardless of whether the
 application enters the national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)** before or after March
 16, 2013. Additionally, adding claims after March 16, 2013 in an application filed
 before March 16, 2013 via an amendment which contains new matter does not make the
 changes to **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** in the AIA applicable
 to the application because **[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)** prohibits the
 introduction of new matter into the disclosure. If new matter is added via amendment,
 claims directed to the new matter will be rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. See **[MPEP ยง 608.04](s608.html#d0e50812)**.
 




# 2159.02 Applications Filed on or After March 16,
 2013 [R-11.2013]


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** took effect on March 16, 2013.
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply to any patent application
 that contains or contained at any time a claim to a claimed invention that has an
 effective filing date that is on or after March 16, 2013. If a patent application (1)
 contains or contained at any time a claim to a claimed invention having an effective
 filing date as defined in **[35 U.S.C. 100(i)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)** that is on or after
 March 16, 2013 or (2) claims or ever claimed the benefit of an earlier filing date under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** , **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, or **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)** based upon an
 earlier application that ever contained such a claim, then **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** apply to the application, (i.e.,
 the application is an AIA application). If there is ever even a single claim to a
 claimed invention in the application having an effective filing date on or after March
 16, 2013, **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply in determining the
 patentability of every claimed invention in the application. This is the situation even
 if the remaining claimed inventions all have an effective filing date before March 16,
 2013, and even if the claim to a claimed invention having an effective filing date on or
 after March 16, 2013, is canceled.
 


If an application filed on or after March 16, 2013, that
 did not previously contain any claim to a claimed invention having an effective filing
 date on or after March 16, 2013, (a pre-AIA application) is amended to contain a claim
 to a claimed invention having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, the
 application becomes an AIA application (**[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply to the application), provided that the newly added
 claimed invention has support under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** in the application
 filed on or after March 16, 2013. The application also becomes subject to
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** even if the claim to a claimed
 invention having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, is subsequently
 canceled. If an amendment after an Office action causes the application to change from
 being governed by **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** (from being a pre-AIA
 application) to being governed by **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** (to being a AIA application), any new ground of rejection
 necessitated by the change in applicable law would be considered a new ground of
 rejection necessitated by an amendment for purposes of determining whether the next
 Office action may be made final. See **[MPEP ยง 706.07(a)](s706.html#d0e69118)**.
 


As **[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)** prohibits the
 introduction of new matter into the disclosure, an application may not contain a claim
 to a claimed invention that does not have support under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** in the application (that is directed to new matter). Thus,
 an application cannot "contain" a claim to a claimed invention that is directed to new
 matter for purposes of determining whether the application ever contained a claim to a
 claimed invention having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013. Amendments
 that are believed to contain new matter should be treated as follows: (1) a new drawing
 should not be entered if the examiner discovers that the drawing contains new matter
 (**[MPEP ยง
 608.02](s608.html#d0e47639)**, subsection II.); and (2) amendments to the written
 description or claims involving new matter are ordinarily entered, but the new matter is
 required to be canceled from the written description and the claims directed to the new
 matter are rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**
 (**[MPEP ยง
 608.04](s608.html#d0e50812)**). This process for treating amendments containing new
 matter is purely an administrative process for handling an amendment seeking to
 introduce new matter into the disclosure of the invention in violation of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)**, and for resolving disputes between the applicant and an
 examiner as to whether a new drawing or amendment to the written description or claims
 would actually introduce new matter into the disclosure of the invention. Therefore, an
 amendment (other than a preliminary amendment filed on the same day as such application)
 seeking to add a claim to a claimed invention that is directed to new matter in an
 application filed on or after March 16, 2013, that, as originally filed, discloses and
 claims only subject matter also disclosed in an earlier application filed before March
 16, 2013 to which the application filed on or after March 16, 2013, is entitled to
 priority or benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**,
 **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, or **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, would not change the
 application from a pre-AIA application into an AIA application.
 




# 2159.03 Applications Subject to the AIA but Also
 Containing a Claimed Invention Having an Effective Filing Date Before March 16,
 2013 [R-11.2013]


Even if **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply to a patent application, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** also applies to every claim in the application if it: (1)
 contains or contained at any time a claimed invention having an effective filing date as
 defined in **[35 U.S.C. 100(i)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)** that occurs before March 16, 2013; or (2) is
 ever designated as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part of an application
 that contains or contained at any time such a claim. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** also
 applies to any patent resulting from an application to which **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** applied. See **[MPEP ยง 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)**.
 


Thus, if an application contains, or contained at any
 time, any claim having an effective filing date that occurs before March 16, 2013, and
 also contains, or contained at any time, any claim having an effective filing date that
 is on or after March 16, 2013, each claim must be patentable under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**, as well as **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**, for the applicant to be entitled to a patent. However, an
 application will not otherwise be concurrently subject to both **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** and **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**.
 


For these reasons, when subject matter is claimed in an
 application filed on or after March 16, 2013 having priority to or the benefit (e.g.,
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, or **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**) of a prior
 application filed before March 16, 2013, care must be taken to accurately determine
 whether AIA or **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** applies to the application. See
 Also **[MPEP ยง
 2151](s2151.html#ch2100_d2002f_22873_3d8)**.
 




# 2159.04 Applicant Statement in Transition Applications
 Containing a Claimed Invention Having an Effective Filing Date on or After March 16,
 2013 [R-11.2013]


The Office revised **[37 CFR 1.55](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e319215)** and **[1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320662)** to
 require that if a nonprovisional application filed on or after March 16, 2013, claims
 the benefit of or priority to an application where the filing date of a foreign, U.S.
 provisional, U.S. nonprovisional, or international application is prior to March 16,
 2013 (termed as "a transition application"), and also contains or contained at any time
 a claimed invention having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, the
 applicant must provide a statement to that effect ("the **[37 CFR 1.55](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e319215)** or
 **[1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320662)** statement"). This information will assist the Office in
 determining whether the transition application is subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. However, applicant is not
 required to provide this information if the transition application claims the benefit of
 an earlier transition application in which a **[37 CFR 1.55](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e319215)** or **[37 CFR 1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320662)**
 statement has been filed. See **[37 CFR 1.78(c)(6)(i)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_20810_23e)**. See also

# 2159.01 Applications Filed Before March 16,

The changes to **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** in the AIA do not apply to any
 application filed before March 16, 2013. Thus, any application filed before March 16,
 2013, is governed by **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** (i.e., the application is a
 pre-AIA first to invent application). Note that neither the filing of a request for
 continued examination, nor entry into the national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**,
 constitutes the filing of a new application. Accordingly, even if a request for
 continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322625)** is filed on or after
 March 16, 2013, in an application that was filed before March 16, 2013, the application
 remains subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. Similarly, a PCT application
 filed under **[35
 U.S.C. 363](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306994313)** before March 16, 2013, is subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, regardless of whether the
 application enters the national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)** before or after March
 16, 2013. Additionally, adding claims after March 16, 2013 in an application filed
 before March 16, 2013 via an amendment which contains new matter does not make the
 changes to **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** in the AIA applicable
 to the application because **[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)** prohibits the
 introduction of new matter into the disclosure. If new matter is added via amendment,

 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply to any patent application
 that contains or contained at any time a claim to a claimed invention that has an
 effective filing date that is on or after March 16, 2013. If a patent application (1)
 contains or contained at any time a claim to a claimed invention having an effective
 filing date as defined in **[35 U.S.C. 100(i)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)** that is on or after

 earlier application that ever contained such a claim, then **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** apply to the application, (i.e.,
 the application is an AIA application). If there is ever even a single claim to a
 claimed invention in the application having an effective filing date on or after March
 16, 2013, **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply in determining the
 patentability of every claimed invention in the application. This is the situation even
 if the remaining claimed inventions all have an effective filing date before March 16,
 2013, and even if the claim to a claimed invention having an effective filing date on or
 after March 16, 2013, is canceled.
 


If an application filed on or after March 16, 2013, that
 did not previously contain any claim to a claimed invention having an effective filing
 date on or after March 16, 2013, (a pre-AIA application) is amended to contain a claim
 to a claimed invention having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, the
 application becomes an AIA application (**[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply to the application), provided that the newly added
 claimed invention has support under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** in the application
 filed on or after March 16, 2013. The application also becomes subject to
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** even if the claim to a claimed
 invention having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, is subsequently
 canceled. If an amendment after an Office action causes the application to change from
 being governed by **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** (from being a pre-AIA
 application) to being governed by **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** (to being a AIA application), any new ground of rejection
 necessitated by the change in applicable law would be considered a new ground of
 rejection necessitated by an amendment for purposes of determining whether the next
 Office action may be made final. See **[MPEP ยง 706.07(a)](s706.html#d0e69118)**.
 


As **[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)** prohibits the
 introduction of new matter into the disclosure, an application may not contain a claim
 to a claimed invention that does not have support under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** in the application (that is directed to new matter). Thus,
 an application cannot "contain" a claim to a claimed invention that is directed to new
 matter for purposes of determining whether the application ever contained a claim to a
 claimed invention having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013. Amendments
 that are believed to contain new matter should be treated as follows: (1) a new drawing
 should not be entered if the examiner discovers that the drawing contains new matter
 (**[MPEP ยง
 608.02](s608.html#d0e47639)**, subsection II.); and (2) amendments to the written
 description or claims involving new matter are ordinarily entered, but the new matter is
 required to be canceled from the written description and the claims directed to the new
 matter are rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**
 (**[MPEP ยง
 608.04](s608.html#d0e50812)**). This process for treating amendments containing new
 matter is purely an administrative process for handling an amendment seeking to
 introduce new matter into the disclosure of the invention in violation of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)**, and for resolving disputes between the applicant and an
 examiner as to whether a new drawing or amendment to the written description or claims
 would actually introduce new matter into the disclosure of the invention. Therefore, an
 amendment (other than a preliminary amendment filed on the same day as such application)
 seeking to add a claim to a claimed invention that is directed to new matter in an
 application filed on or after March 16, 2013, that, as originally filed, discloses and
 claims only subject matter also disclosed in an earlier application filed before March
 16, 2013 to which the application filed on or after March 16, 2013, is entitled to
 priority or benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**,
 **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, or **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, would not change the
 application from a pre-AIA application into an AIA application.

# 2159.03 Applications Subject to the AIA but Also
 Containing a Claimed Invention Having an Effective Filing Date Before March 16,
 2013 [R-11.2013]


Even if **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply to a patent application, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** also applies to every claim in the application if it: (1)
 contains or contained at any time a claimed invention having an effective filing date as
 defined in **[35 U.S.C. 100(i)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)** that occurs before March 16, 2013; or (2) is
 ever designated as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part of an application
 that contains or contained at any time such a claim. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** also
 applies to any patent resulting from an application to which **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** applied. See **[MPEP ยง 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)**.
 


Thus, if an application contains, or contained at any
 time, any claim having an effective filing date that occurs before March 16, 2013, and
 also contains, or contained at any time, any claim having an effective filing date that
 is on or after March 16, 2013, each claim must be patentable under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**, as well as **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**, for the applicant to be entitled to a patent. However, an
 application will not otherwise be concurrently subject to both **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** and **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**.
 


For these reasons, when subject matter is claimed in an
 application filed on or after March 16, 2013 having priority to or the benefit (e.g.,
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, or **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**) of a prior
 application filed before March 16, 2013, care must be taken to accurately determine
 whether AIA or **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** applies to the application. See
 Also **[MPEP ยง
 2151](s2151.html#ch2100_d2002f_22873_3d8)**.

# 2159.04 Applicant Statement in Transition Applications
 Containing a Claimed Invention Having an Effective Filing Date on or After March 16,
 2013 [R-11.2013]


The Office revised **[37 CFR 1.55](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e319215)** and **[1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320662)** to
 require that if a nonprovisional application filed on or after March 16, 2013, claims
 the benefit of or priority to an application where the filing date of a foreign, U.S.
 provisional, U.S. nonprovisional, or international application is prior to March 16,
 2013 (termed as "a transition application"), and also contains or contained at any time
 a claimed invention having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, the
 applicant must provide a statement to that effect ("the **[37 CFR 1.55](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e319215)** or
 **[1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320662)** statement"). This information will assist the Office in
 determining whether the transition application is subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. However, applicant is not
 required to provide this information if the transition application claims the benefit of
 an earlier transition application in which a **[37 CFR 1.55](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e319215)** or **[37 CFR 1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320662)**
 statement has been filed. See **[37 CFR 1.78(c)(6)(i)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_20810_23e)**. See also
 **[MPEP ยง
