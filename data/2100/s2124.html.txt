# 2124 Exception to the Rule That the Reference Must be Prior
 Art [R-10.2019]

**IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES A FACTUAL REFERENCE NEED NOT ANTEDATE THE FILING DATE**In certain circumstances, references cited to show a universal fact
 need not be available as prior art before applicant’s filing date. *In re
 Wilson,* 311 F.2d 266, 135 USPQ 442 (CCPA 1962). Such facts include the
 characteristics and properties of a material or a scientific truism. Some specific
 examples in which later publications showing factual evidence can be cited include
 situations where the facts shown in the reference are evidence "that, as of
 an application’s filing date, undue experimentation would have been
 required, *In re Corneil,* 347 F.2d 563, 568, 145 USPQ 702, 705 (CCPA
 1965), or that a parameter absent from the claims was or was not critical, *In
 re Rainer,* 305 F.2d 505, 507 n.3, 134 USPQ 343, 345 n.3 (CCPA 1962), or
 that a statement in the specification was inaccurate, *In re**Marzocchi,* 439 F.2d 220, 223 n.4, 169 USPQ 367, 370 n.4 (CCPA 1971),
 or that the invention was inoperative or lacked utility, *In re
 Langer,* 503 F.2d 1380, 1391, 183 USPQ 288, 297 (CCPA 1974), or that a claim
 was indefinite, *In re Glass,* 492 F.2d 1228,1232 n.6, 181 USPQ 31, 34
 n.6 (CCPA 1974), or that characteristics of prior art products were known, *In
 re Wilson,* 311 F.2d 266, 135 USPQ 442 (CCPA 1962)." *In re
 Koller,* 613 F.2d 819, 824 n.5, 204 USPQ 702, 706 n.5 (CCPA 1980) (quoting
 *In re Hogan,* 559 F.2d 595, 605 n.17, 194 USPQ 527, 537 n.17 (CCPA

 evidence could be relied upon to show that patent failed to disclose a representative
 number of species of a claimed genus, and to show that patentees may have engaged in
 undue experimentation as of the effective filing date to enable the full scope of the
 claims). However, it is impermissible to use a later factual reference showing the state
 of the art existing after the effective filing date of the application to determine
 whether the application is enabled or described as required under **[35 U.S.C.

 post-effective-filing-date state of the art is improper. *Amgen,* 872

# 2124.01 Tax Strategies Deemed Within the Prior
 Art [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the
 relevant date is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the
 "time of the invention," which is only applicable to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*

**I.** **OVERVIEW****[The
 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), Public Law 112-29, sec.
 14](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#aiasec14taxstrategy)**, 125 Stat. 284 (September 16, 2011) provides that for
 purposes of evaluating an invention for novelty and nonobviousness under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, any strategy for
 reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability (hereinafter "tax strategy"), whether
 known or unknown at the time of the invention or application for patent, shall be
 deemed insufficient to differentiate a claimed invention from the prior art. As a
 result, applicants will no longer be able to rely on the novelty or non-obviousness
 of a tax strategy embodied in their claims to distinguish them from the prior art.
 Any tax strategy will be considered indistinguishable from all other publicly
 available information that is relevant to a patent’s claim of originality. This
 provision aims to keep the ability to interpret the tax law and to implement such
 interpretation in the public domain, available to all taxpayers and their
 advisors.
 


The term "tax liability" is defined for purposes of this
 provision as referring to any liability for a tax under any federal, state, or local
 law, or the law of any foreign jurisdiction, including any statute, rule, regulation,
 or ordinance that levies, imposes, or assesses such tax liability.
 


There are two exclusions to this provision. The first
 is that the provision does not apply to that part of an invention that is a method,
 apparatus, technology, computer program product, or system, that is used solely for
 preparing a tax or information return or other tax filing, including one that
 records, transmits, transfers, or organizes data related to such filing.
 


The second is that the provision does not apply to
 that part of an invention that is a method, apparatus, technology, computer program
 product, or system, that is used solely for financial management, to the extent that
 it is severable from any tax strategy or does not limit the use of any tax strategy
 by any taxpayer or tax advisor.
 


This provision took effect on September 16, 2011, and
 applies to any patent application that is pending on, or filed on or after, September
 16, 2011, and to any patent issued on or after September 16, 2011. Accordingly, this
 provision will apply in a reexamination or other post-grant proceeding only to
 patents issued on or after September 16, 2011.
 

**II.** **EXAMINATION GUIDANCE FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO TAX STRATEGIES**The following procedure should be followed when
 examining claims relating to tax strategies.
 


* 1. Construe the claim in accordance with
 **[MPEP §
 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)***et seq.*
* 2. Analyze the claim for compliance with
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** in accordance with
 current guidance, which is unaffected by this provision.
* 3. Identify any limitations relating to a tax
 strategy, as defined above (note the listed exclusions).
	+ a. Inventions that fall within the scope of
	 **[AIA section 14](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#aiasec14taxstrategy)**
	 include those tax strategies especially suitable for use with tax-favored
	 structures that must meet certain requirements, such as employee benefit
	 plans, tax-exempt organizations, or other entities that must be
	 structured or operated in a particular manner to obtain certain tax
	 consequences.
	+ b. Thus, **[AIA section
	 14](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#aiasec14taxstrategy)** applies if the effect of an invention is to aid
	 in satisfying the qualification requirements for a desired tax-favored
	 entity status, to take advantage of the specific tax benefits offered in
	 a tax-favored structure, or to allow for tax reduction, avoidance, or
	 deferral not otherwise automatically available in such entity or
	 structure.
* 4. Evaluate the claim in view of the prior art
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, treating any
 limitations relating to a tax strategy as being within the prior art, and not
 as a patentable difference between the claim and the prior art. This approach
 is analogous to the treatment of printed matter limitations in a claim as
 discussed at **[MPEP § 2112.01](s2112.html#d0e201273)**, subsection III.


Form paragraph **[7.06.01](#fp7.06.01)** may be used to indicate
 claim limitation(s) interpreted as a tax strategy. 
 


# ¶ 7.06.01 Claim Limitation Relating to a Tax Strategy Deemed To Be
 Within the Prior Art under 35 U.S.C. 102 and/or 103


Claim limitation "**[1]**" has been interpreted
 as a strategy for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability ("tax strategy") pursuant to
 Section 14 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. Accordingly, this claim limitation is being
 treated as being within the prior art and is insufficient to differentiate the invention of
 claim **[2]** from the prior art.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. In bracket 1, recite the claim limitation that
 relates to a tax strategy. For more information see **[MPEP §
 2124.01](s2124.html#ch2100_d1b13f_20224_b9)**.
* 2. In bracket 2, insert claim number(s), pluralize
 "claim" as appropriate.


**III.** **EXAMPLES DIRECTED TO COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED METHODS**A computer-implemented method that is deemed novel and
 non-obvious would not be affected by this provision even if used for a tax purpose.
 For example, a novel and non-obvious computer-implemented method for manipulating
 data would not be affected by this provision even if the method organized data for a
 future tax filing. However, a prior art computer-implemented method would not become
 non-obvious by implementing a novel and non-obvious tax strategy. That is, the
 presence of limitations relating to the tax strategy would not cause a claim that is
 otherwise within the prior art to become novel or non-obvious over the prior art. 
 


Thus, for purposes of applying art to a
 software-related invention under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**, claim limitations that are directed solely to
 enabling individuals to file their income tax returns or assisting them with managing
 their finances should be given patentable weight, except that claim limitations
 directed to a tax strategy should not be given patentable weight.
