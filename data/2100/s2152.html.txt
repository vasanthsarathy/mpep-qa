# 2152 Detailed Discussion of AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) and
 (b) [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as
 set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is subject to
 examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP § 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for
 examination of applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** defines the prior art that will preclude the grant of a patent
 on a claimed invention unless an exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)** is applicable.
 Specifically, **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** provides that:
 



> 
> [a] person shall be entitled to a patent unless—
> 
> 
> * (1) the claimed invention was patented, described in a
>  printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the
>  public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention; or
> * (2) the claimed invention was described in a patent
>  issued under **[section 151](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303440)**, or in an application for patent published or
>  deemed published under **[section 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)**, in which the
>  patent or application, as the case may be, names another inventor and was
>  effectively filed before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.
> 
> 
> 


As an initial matter, Office personnel should note that the
 introductory phrase "[a] person shall be entitled to a patent unless" remains unchanged
 from the pre-AIA version of **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Thus, **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** continues to provide that the Office bears the initial burden of
 explaining why the applicable statutory or regulatory requirements have not been met if a
 claim in an application is to be rejected. The AIA also does not change the requirement
 that whenever a claim for a patent is rejected or an objection or requirement is made, the
 Office shall notify the applicant thereof and state the reasons for such rejection,
 objection, or requirement, and provide such information and references as may be useful to
 the applicant in judging of the propriety of continuing the prosecution of the application.
 See **[35 U.S.C.
 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)**, **[37 CFR 1.104(c)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322163)** and
 **[MPEP §
 706](s706.html#d0e57969)**. 
 


The categories of prior art documents and activities are set
 forth in **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and the categories of prior art patent documents are
 set forth in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. These documents and activities are used to
 determine whether a claimed invention is novel or nonobvious. The documents upon which a
 prior art rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** may be based are an
 issued patent, a published application, and a non-patent printed publication. The documents
 upon which a prior art rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** may be based are
 U.S. patent documents only (see discussion of U.S. patent documents in
 **[MPEP §
 2151](s2151.html#ch2100_d2002f_22873_3d8)**). Evidence that the claimed invention was in public use, on
 sale, or otherwise available to the public may also be used as the basis for a prior art
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. Note that a printed publication that does not
 have a sufficiently early publication date to itself qualify as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** may be competent evidence of a previous public use,
 sale activity, or other availability of a claimed invention to the public where the public
 use, sale activity, or other public availability does have a sufficiently early date to
 qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. See
 *In re Epstein,* 32 F.3d 1559, 31 USPQ2d 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1994) and
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(b)](s2133.html#d0e203781)**, subsection III.C.
 


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)** sets out exceptions to **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)**, in that prior art that otherwise would be included in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** shall not be prior art if it falls within an exception
 under **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)**.
 


Exceptions to the categories of prior art defined in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** are provided in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**. Specifically, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** states that "[a] disclosure made 1 year or less before the
 effective filing date of a claimed invention shall not be prior art to the claimed
 invention under subsection (a)(1) if—
 


* (A) the disclosure was made by the inventor or a joint
 inventor or by another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or
 indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor; or
* (B) the subject matter disclosed had, before such
 disclosure, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor or another
 who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or
 a joint inventor."


Exceptions to the categories of prior art defined in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** are provided in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)**. Specifically, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** states that "[a] disclosure shall not be prior art to a
 claimed invention under subsection (a)(2) if—
 


* (A) the subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or
 indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor;
* (B) the subject matter disclosed had, before such subject
 matter was effectively filed under subsection (a)(2), been publicly disclosed by the
 inventor or a joint inventor or another who obtained the subject matter disclosed
 directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor; or
* (C) the subject matter disclosed and the claimed
 invention, not later than the effective filing date of the claimed invention, were
 owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same
 person."


Although some of the provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)** are similar to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**, **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, and **[(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, the AIA has
 introduced a number of important changes with respect to prior art documents and activities
 (collectively, "disclosures"). First, the availability of a U.S. patent document as prior
 art to a claimed invention is measured from the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention as defined in **[35 U.S.C. 100(i)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)**, which takes into
 account both foreign priority and domestic benefit dates. Note that this differs from
 practice under **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** wherein the availability of a patent document as prior art
 is measured from either "the date of the application for patent in the United States"
 (**[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**) or "the invention thereof by the applicant for patent"
 (**[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**). Second, the AIA adopts a global
 view of prior art disclosures and thus does not require that a public use or sale activity
 be "in this country" to be a prior art activity. Finally, a catch-all "otherwise available
 to the public" category of prior art is added.
 



# 2152.01 Effective Filing Date of the Claimed
 Invention [R-10.2019]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** reference patent-defeating
 activities occurring before the applicant invented the claimed invention.
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** make no mention of the date
 of the invention, but instead concern documents that existed or activities that occurred
 "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention." As a result, it is no
 longer possible to antedate or "swear behind" certain prior art disclosures by making a
 showing under **[37
 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** that the applicant invented the claimed subject matter
 prior to the effective date of the prior art disclosure.
 


The AIA defines the term "effective filing date" for a
 claimed invention in a patent or application for patent (other than a reissue
 application or reissued patent) as the earliest of: (1) the actual filing date of the
 patent or the application for the patent containing the claimed invention; or (2) the
 filing date of the earliest application for which the patent or application is entitled,
 as to such invention, to a right of priority or the benefit of an earlier filing date
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**,
 **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, or **[386](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_27b56_2ab)**. See **[35 U.S.C.
 100(i)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_3b9)**. 
 


In examining applications subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, the effective filing date is the actual filing date of the
 U.S. application, unless situation (A), (B), (C), or (D) as set forth below applies.
 Note that the actual filing date of an application that entered the national stage under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)** is the international filing date (see **[35 U.S.C. 363](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306994313)**
 and **[MPEP §
 1893.03(b)](s1893.html#d0e191308)**); the actual the filing date of an international
 design application in the United States is the date of international registration
 determined by the International Bureau under the Hague Agreement (in the absence of a
 petition for review)(see **[37 CFR 1.1023](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d22557_18738_3c9)** and
 **[MPEP §
 2908](s2908.html#ch2900_d24abb_26063_251)**).
 


* (A) If the application is a continuation or divisional of one or more
 earlier U.S. applications or international applications and if the requirements of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)** have been satisfied, the effective filing date is
 the same as the earliest filing date in the line of continuation or divisional
 applications.
* (B) If the application is a continuation-in-part of an earlier U.S.
 application or international application, any claims in the new application not
 supported by the specification and claims of the parent application have an
 effective filing date equal to the actual filing date of the new application. Any
 claims which are fully supported under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** by the earlier
 parent application have the effective filing date of that earlier parent
 application.
* (C) If the application properly claims benefit under **[35 U.S.C.
 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)** to a provisional application, the effective filing
 date is the filing date of the provisional application for any claims which are
 fully supported under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)** by the
 provisional application.
* (D) If the application claims foreign priority under **[35 U.S.C.
 119(a)-(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, **[365(a) or (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307039)**, or
 **[386(a) or (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a27_324)**, the effective filing date is the filing date
 of the foreign priority document if the claim is adequately supported in the
 foreign priority document.


See **[MPEP § 1893.03(c)](s1893.html#d0e191506)** for a discussion of claims for priority to,
 or the benefit of, the filing date of a prior-filed foreign or domestic application in
 an application that entered the national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**. See
 **[MPEP §§
 211.01(c)](s211.html#ch200_d1ff71_22ea8_22b)** and **[1895](s1895.html#d0e192715)** for additional information on
 determining the effective filing date of a continuation, divisional, or
 continuation-in-part of a PCT application designating the U.S. See also
 **[MPEP §§
 1895.01](s1895.html#d0e192774)** and **[1896](s1896.html#d0e193032)** which discuss differences between
 applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302673)** and international
 applications that enter national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**.
 


See **[MPEP §§ 2920.05(d)](s2920.html#ch2900_d24abc_19867_17)** and
 **[2920.05(e)](s2920.html#ch2900_d24abc_1991a_125)** for a discussion of claims for priority to, or the
 benefit of, the filing date of a prior-filed foreign or domestic application in
 international design applications.
 


The one-year grace period (as defined in
 **[MPEP §
 2151](s2151.html#ch2100_d2002f_22873_3d8)**) in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** is measured
 from the filing date of any U.S. or foreign patent application to which the patent or
 application is entitled to benefit or priority as to such invention, whereas the
 one-year grace period in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** is measured
 from only the filing date of the earliest application filed in the United States
 (directly or through the PCT).
 


As under pre-AIA law, the effective filing date of a
 claimed invention is determined on a claim-by-claim basis and not an
 application-by-application basis. That is, the principle that different claims in the
 same application may be entitled to different effective filing dates vis-à-vis the prior
 art remains unchanged by the AIA. See **[MPEP § 2133.01](s2133.html#d0e203726)** for a discussion of
 relevant pre-AIA case law in the context of continuation-in-part applications. However,
 it is important to note that although prior art is applied on a claim-by-claim basis,
 the determination of whether **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** or **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply is made on an application-by-application basis.
 **[MPEP §
 2151](s2151.html#ch2100_d2002f_22873_3d8)** and **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** discuss the applicability
 date provisions of section 3 of the AIA.
 


Finally, the AIA provides that the "effective filing
 date" for a claimed invention in a reissued patent or application for a reissue patent
 shall be determined by deeming the claim to the claimed invention to have been contained
 in the patent for which reissue was sought. See **[35 U.S.C.
 100(i)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_3e1)**.

# 2152.02(a) Patented [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application

**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** indicates that a prior patent of a claimed
 invention will preclude the grant of a subsequent patent on the claimed invention.
 This means that if a claimed invention was patented in this or a foreign country
 before the effective filing date of the claimed invention, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** precludes the grant of a patent on the claimed
 invention. The effective date of the patent for purposes of determining whether the
 patent qualifies as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is the
 grant date of the patent. There is an exception to this rule if the patent is secret
 as of the date the rights are awarded. See *In re Ekenstam,* 256
 F.2d 321, 323, 118 USPQ 349, 353 (CCPA 1958); see also **[MPEP § 2126.01](s2126.html#d0e202293)**. In
 such situations, the patent is available as prior art as of the date the patent was
 made available to the public by being laid open for public inspection or disseminated
 in printed form. See *In re Carlson,* 983 F.2d 1032, 1037, 25 USPQ2d
 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1992); see also **[MPEP § 2126](s2126.html#d0e202195)**. The phrase "patented"
 in **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** has the same meaning as "patented" in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. For a discussion of
 "patented" as used in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and
 **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, see generally **[MPEP § 2126](s2126.html#d0e202195)**.
 


Although an invention may be described in a patent and
 not claimed therein, the grant date would also be the applicable prior art date for
 purposes of relying on the subject matter disclosed therein as "described in a
 printed publication," provided that the patent was made available to the public on
 its grant date. Note that a U.S. patent that issues after the effective filing date
 of a claimed invention and is not available as prior art against that invention under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** could be available as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 




# 2152.02(b) Described in a Printed Publication [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


If a claimed invention is described in a patent,
 published patent application, or printed publication, such a document may be
 available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. Both
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** and **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** use the term "described" with respect to an invention
 in a prior art printed publication. Likewise, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** uses that term with respect to U.S. patents, U.S.
 patent application publications, and WIPO published applications. Thus, the Office
 does not view the AIA as changing the extent to which a claimed invention must be
 described for a prior art document to anticipate the claimed invention under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.
 


While the conditions for patentability of
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** require a written description of the claimed
 invention that would have enabled a person skilled in the art to make as well as use
 the invention, the prior art provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** require only that the
 claimed invention is "described" in a prior art document (patent, published patent
 application, or printed publication). The two basic requirements that must be met by
 a prior art document in order to describe a claimed invention such that it is
 anticipated under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** are the same as
 those under **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. First, "each and every element of the claimed
 invention" must be disclosed either explicitly or inherently, and the elements must
 be "arranged or combined in the same way as in the claim." See *In re
 Gleave,* 560 F.3d 1331, 1334, 90 USPQ2d 1235, 1237-38 (Fed. Cir. 2009),
 citing *Eli Lilly & Co. v. Zenith Goldline Pharms., Inc.,* 471
 F.3d 1369, 1375, 81 USPQ2d 1324,1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); *Net MoneyIN, Inc. v.
 VeriSign, Inc.,* 545 F.3d 1359, 1370, 88 USPQ2d 1751, 1759 (Fed. Cir.
 2008); *In re Bond,* 910 F.2d 831, 832-33, 15 USPQ2d 1566, 1567
 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Second, a person of ordinary skill in the art must have been
 enabled to make the invention without undue experimentation. See
 *Gleave,* 560 F.3d at 1334, 90 USPQ2d at 1238 (citing
 *Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharms. Inc.,* 545 F.3d 1312, 1314,
 88 USPQ2d 1381, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2008), and *In re LeGrice,* 301 F.2d
 929, 940-44, 133 USPQ 365, 372 (CCPA 1962)). Thus, in order for a prior art document
 to describe a claimed invention such that it is anticipated under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, it must disclose all
 elements of the claimed invention arranged as they are in the claim, and also provide
 sufficient guidance to enable a person skilled in the art to make the claimed
 invention. There is, however, no requirement that a prior art document meet the "how
 to use" requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** in order to
 qualify as prior art. See *Gleave,* 560 F.3d at 1334, 90 USPQ2d at
 1237-38; see also *In re Schoenwald,* 964 F.2d 1122, 1124, 22 USPQ2d
 1671, 1673 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (holding that a claimed compound was anticipated even
 though the prior art reference did not disclose a use for the compound);
 *Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc.,* 339 F.3d 1373, 1380-81,
 67 USPQ2d 1664, 1670 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (pointing out that actually reducing the
 invention to practice is not necessary in order for a prior art reference to
 anticipate); *Impax Labs,* 468 F.3d at 1382 (stating that "proof of
 efficacy is not required for a prior art reference to be enabling for purposes of
 anticipation"). Furthermore, compliance with the "how to make" requirement is judged
 from the viewpoint of a person of ordinary skill in the art, and thus does not
 require that the prior art document explicitly disclose information within the
 knowledge of such a person. See *In re Donohue,* 766 F.2d 531, 533,
 226 USPQ 619, 621 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 


There is an additional important distinction between
 the written description that is necessary to support a claim under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and the description sufficient to anticipate the subject
 matter of the claim under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or
 **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. See *Rasmussen v. SmithKline Beecham
 Corp.,* 413 F.3d 1318, 75 USPQ2d 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2005). To provide
 support for a claim under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, it is necessary
 that the specification describe and enable the entire scope of the claimed invention.
 However, in order for a prior art document to describe a claimed invention under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, the prior art document need only describe and enable
 one skilled in the art to make a single species or embodiment of the claimed
 invention. See *Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1562, 19
 USPQ2d 1111, 1115 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("As the court pointed out, ‘the description of a
 single embodiment of broadly claimed subject matter constitutes a description of the
 invention for anticipation purposes..., whereas the same information in a
 specification might not alone be enough to provide a description of that invention
 for purposes of adequate disclosure.’") (quoting *In re Lukach,* 442
 F.2d 967, 970, 169 USPQ 795, 797 (CCPA 1971)); see also *In re Van
 Langenhoven,* 458 F.2d 132, 173 USPQ 426 (CCPA 1972), and *In re
 Ruscetta,* 255 F.2d 687, 118 USPQ 101 (CCPA 1958). 
 


An anticipatory description it is not required in
 order for a disclosure to qualify as prior art, unless the disclosure is being used
 as the basis for an anticipation rejection. In accordance with pre-AIA case law
 concerning obviousness, a disclosure may be cited for all that it would reasonably
 have made known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the description
 requirement of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and
 **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** does not preclude an examiner from applying a
 disclosure in an obviousness rejection under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** simply because the disclosure is not adequate to anticipate
 the claimed invention.
 




# 2152.02(c) In Public Use [R-10.2019]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is
 **only applicable** to applications subject to examination under the
 first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as set forth in
 **[35
 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


Public use rejections under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** may be based on uses that are public anywhere in the
 world. While there is no requirement that the use or sale activity be by another, it
 should be noted that certain uses or sales are subject to the exceptions in
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**, e.g., uses or sales by the inventor or a
 joint inventor (or have originated with the inventor) that precede the effective
 filing date by less than one year. See **[MPEP §
 2154.02](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_139ac_31b)**.
 


Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, an
 invention that was "in public use" precluded the grant of a patent only if such
 public use occurred "in this country." See **[MPEP § 2133.03(d)](s2133.html#d0e204651)**.
 


Under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, there is
 no geographic limitation on where prior public use or public availability occurs.
 Furthermore, a public use would need to occur before the effective filing date of the
 claimed invention to constitute prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**.
 


The pre-AIA case law also indicates that a public use
 will bar patentability if the public use occurs before the critical date and the
 invention is ready for patenting. Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, the
 critical date is the date that is one year prior to the date of application for
 patent in the United States. See *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing.
 L.P.,* 424 F.3d 1374, 1379-80, 76 USPQ2d 1741, 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2005) and
 **[MPEP §
 2133](s2133.html#d0e203671)**. Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, the
 uses of an invention before the patent's critical date that constitute a "public use"
 fall into two categories: the use either "(1) was accessible to the public; or (2)
 was commercially exploited." See *American Seating Co. v. USSC Group,
 Inc.,* 514 F.3d 1262, 1267, 85 USPQ2d 1683, 1685 (Fed. Cir. 2008) and
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**. Whether a use is a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** public use also depends on who is making the use of the
 invention. "[W]hen an asserted prior use is not that of the applicant,
 **[[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C.] 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** is not a bar when that prior use or knowledge is
 not available to the public." See *Woodland Trust v. Flowertree Nursery,
 Inc.,* 148 F.3d 1368, 1371, 47 USPQ2d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In
 other words, a use by a third party who did not obtain the invention from the
 inventor named in the application or patent is an invalidating use under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** only if it falls into the first category: That
 the use was accessible to the public. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**, subsection II.C.
 On the other hand, "an inventor's own prior commercial use, albeit kept secret, may
 constitute a public use or sale under **[[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.] 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**,
 barring him from obtaining a patent." See *Woodland Trust,* 148 F.3d
 at 1370, 47 USPQ2d at 1366 and **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**, subsection II.A.
 Also, an inventor creates a public use bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** when the
 inventor shows the invention to, or allows it to be used by, another person who is
 "under no limitation, restriction, or obligation of confidentiality" to the inventor.
 See *American Seating,* 514 F.3d at 1267 and **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**,
 subsection II.B.
 


Further, under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**, "in
 order to invalidate a patent based on prior knowledge or use" by another in this
 country prior to the patent's priority date, "that knowledge or use must have been
 available to the public." See *Woodland Trust,* 148 F.3d at 1370, 47
 USPQ2d at 1366 and **[MPEP § 2132](s2132.html#d0e203390)**, subsection I. Patent-defeating "use," under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** includes only that "use which is accessible to
 the public." See *id.* (quoting *Carella v. Starlight
 Archery,* 804 F.2d 135, 139, 231 USPQ 644, 646 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).
 


As discussed previously, public use under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is limited to those uses that are available to
 the public. The public use provision of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** thus has
 the same substantive scope, with respect to uses by either the inventor or a third
 party, as public uses under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** by
 unrelated third parties or others under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**.
 


As also discussed previously, once an examiner becomes
 aware that a claimed invention has been the subject of a potentially public use, the
 examiner should require the applicant to provide information showing that the use did
 not make the claimed process accessible to the public. 
 




# 2152.02(d) On Sale [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**
 et seq. for information about on sale in regard to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


On sale rejections under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** may be based on sales or offers for sale without
 regard to where the sale activity took place. While there is no requirement that the
 sale activity be by another, it should be noted that certain uses or sales are
 subject to the exceptions in **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**, e.g., uses
 or sales by the inventor or a joint inventor (or have originated with the inventor)
 that precede the effective filing date by less than one year. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2154.02](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_139ac_31b)**.
 


The pre-AIA case law indicates that on sale activity
 will bar patentability if the claimed invention was: (1) the subject of a commercial
 sale or offer for sale, not primarily for experimental purposes; and (2) ready for
 patenting. See *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48
 USPQ2d 1641, 1646-47 (1998). Contract law and commercial law principles apply in
 order to determine whether a commercial sale or offer for sale occurred.
 *Medicines Co. v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363, 1373, 119 USPQ2d
 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (en banc). In addition, the enablement inquiry is not
 applicable to the question of whether a claimed invention is "on sale" under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. See *In re Epstein,* 32 F.3d
 1559, 1568, 31 USPQ2d 1817, 1824 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The phrase "on sale" in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is treated as having the same meaning as "on
 sale" in **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. For a discussion of "on sale" as used in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, see generally **[MPEP § 2133.03(b)](s2133.html#d0e204201)***et seq.*


Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, if an
 invention was "on sale," patentability was precluded only if the invention was on
 sale "in this country." See **[MPEP § 2133.03(d)](s2133.html#d0e204651)**. Under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, there is no geographic limitation on where
 the sale or offer for sale may occur. When formulating a rejection, Office personnel
 should consider evidence of sales activity, regardless of where the sale activity
 took place.
 


The **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** "on
 sale" provision has been interpreted as including commercial activity even if the
 activity is secret. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(b)](s2133.html#d0e204201)**, subsection III.A.
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** uses the same "on sale" term as
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** and is treated as having the same meaning. In
 *Helsinn Healthcare S.A. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,* 139
 S.Ct. 628 (2019), the Supreme Court "determine[d] that Congress did not alter the
 meaning of ‘on sale’ when it enacted the AIA, [and held] that an inventor’s sale of
 an invention to a third party who is obligated to keep the invention confidential can
 qualify as prior art under [AIA 35 U.S.C.] § 102(a)." *Id.* at 634.
 Thus, a sale or offer for sale that does not disclose the subject matter of an
 invention or make the invention available to the general public may nevertheless
 qualify as prior art in an anticipation or obviousness rejection, regardless of
 whether the application or patent under consideration is subject to the FITF
 provisions of the AIA or the first to invent provisions of pre-AIA law.
 




# 2152.02(e) Otherwise Available to the Public [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §

**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** provides a "catch-all" provision, which
 defines a new additional category of potential prior art not provided for in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Specifically, a claimed invention is not entitled
 to a patent if it was "otherwise available to the public" before its effective filing
 date. This "catch-all" provision permits decision makers to focus on whether the
 disclosure was "available to the public," rather than on the means by which the
 claimed invention became available to the public or whether a disclosure constitutes
 a "printed publication" or falls within another category of prior art as defined in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. The availability of the subject matter to the
 public may arise in situations such as a student thesis in a university library (see,
 e.g., *In re Cronyn,* 890 F.2d 1158, 13 USPQ2d 1070 (Fed. Cir.
 1989); *In re Hall,* 781 F.2d 897, 228 USPQ 453 (Fed. Cir. 1986);
 *In re Bayer,* 568 F.2d 1357, 196 USPQ 670 (CCPA 1978) and
 **[MPEP §
 2128.01](s2128.html#d0e202706)**, subsection I.); a poster display or other
 information disseminated at a scientific meeting (see, e.g., *In re
 Klopfenstein,* 380 F.3d 1345, 72 USPQ2d 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2004),
 *Massachusetts Institute of Technology v. AB Fortia,* 774 F.2d
 1104, 227 USPQ 428 (Fed. Cir. 1985), *Jazz Pharm., Inc. v. Amneal Pharm.,
 LLC*, 895 F.3d 1347,127 USPQ2d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 2018), and
 **[MPEP §
 2128.01](s2128.html#d0e202706)**, subsection IV.); subject matter in a laid-open
 patent application or patent (see, e.g., *In re Wyer,* 655 F.2d 221,
 210 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1981); see also *Bruckelmyer v. Ground Heaters,
 Inc.,* 445 F.3d 1374, 78 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 2006)); a document
 electronically posted on the Internet (see, e.g., *Voter Verified, Inc. v.
 Premier Election Solutions, Inc.,* 698 F.3d 1374, 104 USPQ2d 1553 (Fed.
 Cir. 2012), *In re Lister,* 583 F.3d 1307, 92 USPQ2d 1225 (Fed. Cir.
 2009), *SRI Int'l, Inc. v. Internet Sec. Sys., Inc.,* 511 F.3d 1186,
 85 USPQ2d 1489 (Fed. Cir. 2008), and **[MPEP § 2128](s2128.html#d0e202564)**); or a commercial
 transaction that does not constitute a sale under the Uniform Commercial Code (see,
 e.g., *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041, 59
 USPQ2d 1121 (Fed. Cir. 2001) and **[MPEP § 2133.03(e)(1)](s2133.html#d0e204712)**). Even if a
 document or other disclosure is not a printed publication, or a transaction is not a
 sale, either may be prior art under the "otherwise available to the public" provision
 of **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, provided that the claimed invention is made
 sufficiently available to the public. 
 




# 2152.02(f) No Requirement of "By Others" [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application

 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


A key difference between **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is the
 requirement in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** that the prior art relied on was "by
 others." Under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, there is
 no requirement that the prior art relied upon be by others. Thus, any prior art which
 falls under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** need not
 be by another to constitute potentially available prior art. However, disclosures of
 the subject matter made one year or less before the effective filing date of the
 claimed invention by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor may fall
 within an exception under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** to
 **[AIA 35

The Office will continue to treat admissions by the
 applicant as prior art under the AIA. A statement by an applicant in the specification
 or made during prosecution identifying the work of another as "prior art" is an
 admission which can be relied upon for both anticipation and obviousness determinations,
 regardless of whether the admitted prior art would otherwise qualify as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**. See *Riverwood Int'l Corp. v. R.A. Jones &

 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


The AIA does not define the term "disclosure," and
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** does not use the term "disclosure."
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** and **[(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)**, however, each state
 conditions under which a "disclosure" that otherwise falls within **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** is not prior art under

 treating the term "disclosure" as a generic expression intended to encompass the
 documents and activities enumerated in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** (i.e., being

 publication, or WIPO published application).
 




# 2152.05 Determining Whether To Apply 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1) or 102(a)(2) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA as
 explained in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and

 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*

**I.** **35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)**First, the examiner should consider whether the
 reference qualifies as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. Next the
 examiner must determine if any exceptions in **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** apply. 
 


Patents claiming or describing the claimed inventions,
 descriptions of the claimed invention in a printed publication, public use of the
 claimed invention, placing the claimed invention on sale, and otherwise making the
 claimed invention available to the public qualify as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if the reference predates the effective filing
 date of the claim. The sale or use of the invention need not occur in the United
 States to qualify. See **[MPEP § 2152](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_18e23_3ce)**.
 


Potential references may be excepted as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** when the inventor’s own work has been
 publicly disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor.
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** provides that a disclosure which would
 otherwise qualify as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is not prior
 art if the disclosure was made: (1) One year or less before the effective filing date
 of the claimed invention; and (2) by the inventor or a joint inventor, or by another
 who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor. See **[MPEP §§ 2153.01(a)](s2153.html#ch2100_d20033_24e66_2ac)** and
 **[2153.01(b)](s2153.html#ch2100_d20033_256f4_147)**.
 


Potential references may also be excepted as prior art
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** if the reference discloses subject matter
 that was publicly disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who
 obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor. Specifically, **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** provides
 that a disclosure which would otherwise qualify as prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** (patent, printed publication, public use, sale, or
 other means of public availability) may be excepted as prior art if: (1) The
 disclosure was made one year or less before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention; and (2) the subject matter disclosed had been previously publicly
 disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who obtained the subject
 matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor. See
 **[MPEP
 §§ 2153.02](s2153.html#ch2100_d20033_25935_125)** and **[717.01(b)(2)](s717.html#ch700_d1ffd5_19bbd_19a)**.
 

**II.** **35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)**First, the examiner should consider whether the
 reference qualifies as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Next the
 examiner must determine if any exceptions in **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** apply. 
 


U.S. patents, U.S. patent applications published under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)**, and international patent applications published under
 the Patent Cooperation Treaty to another are prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the filing or effective filing date of the
 disclosure of the reference is before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention. Even if the issue or publication date of the reference is not before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention, the reference may still be applicable
 as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if it was
 "effectively filed" before the effective filing date of the claimed invention with
 respect to the subject matter relied upon to reject the claim. **[MPEP §
 2152.01](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1afb3_e6)** discusses the "effective filing date" of a claimed
 invention. **[35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** sets forth the
 criteria to determine when subject matter described in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent
 application publication, or WIPO published application was "effectively filed" for
 purposes of **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2154](s2154.html#ch2100_d20033_274f5_338)**.
 


Potential references may be excepted as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** by the three exception provisions of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)**. **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** limits the
 use of an inventor’s own work as prior art, when the inventor’s own work is disclosed
 in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO published application
 by another who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor
 or joint inventor. **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** excepts as
 prior art subject matter that was effectively filed by another after the subject
 matter had been publicly disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who
 obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor. **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** excepts subject matter disclosed in a
 U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO published application from
 constituting prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the
 subject matter disclosed and the claimed invention, not later than the effective
 filing date of the claimed invention, "were owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person." **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** resembles **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** in that
 both concern common ownership, and both offer an avenue by which an applicant may
 avoid certain prior art. However, there are significant differences between
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**. See

# 2152.07 Form Paragraphs for Use in Rejections Under AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102 [R-10.2019]


The following form paragraphs should be used in making
 the appropriate rejections. Note that the particular part of the reference relied upon
 to support the rejection should be identified. 
 


# ¶ 7.06 Notice re prior art available under both pre-AIA and
 AIA


In the event the determination of the status of the application as subject
 to AIA **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** (or as subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**)
 is incorrect, any correction of the statutory basis for the rejection will not be considered a
 new ground of rejection if the prior art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the
 rejection, would be the same under either status.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1.  This form paragraph must be used in all Office
 Actions when a prior art rejection is made in an application with an actual filing
 date on or after March 16, 2013, that claims priority to, or the benefit of, an
 application filed before March 16, 2013.
* 2.  This form paragraph should only be used ONCE in an
 Office action.

 establishes, to the extent permitted in section **[104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**, that before such person’s invention
 thereof the invention was made by such other inventor and not abandoned, suppressed, or
 concealed, or (2) before such person’s invention thereof, the invention was made in this
 country by another inventor who had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it. In determining
 priority of invention under this subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective
 dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the reasonable
 diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to practice, from a time prior
 to conception by the other.
 


A rejection on this statutory basis (**[35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**
 as in force on March 15, 2013) is appropriate in an application or patent that is examined
 under the first to file provisions of the AIA if it also contains or contained at any time (1)
 a claim to an invention having an effective filing date as defined in **[35 U.S.C.
 100(i)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)** that is before March 16, 2013 or (2) a specific reference under

# ¶ 7.15.01.aia Provisional Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) - Common Assignee,
 Common Applicant, or At Least One Common Joint Inventor


Claim(s) **[1]** is/are provisionally rejected under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** as being anticipated by copending Application No.
 **[2]** which has a common **[3]** with the instant application.
 


Based upon the earlier effective filing date of the
 copending application, it would constitute prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, if published under **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)** or patented under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 151](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303440)**. This provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** is based upon a presumption of future publication or patenting
 of the copending application. **[4]**.
 


This provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** might be overcome by: (1) a showing under **[37 CFR 1.130(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323473)** that the
 subject matter disclosed in the copending application was obtained directly or indirectly from
 the inventor or a joint inventor of this application and is thus not prior art in accordance
 with **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1a7)**; (2) a showing under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** of a prior public
 disclosure under **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)**; or (3) a statement pursuant to
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** establishing that, not later than the effective filing date
 of the claimed invention, the subject matter disclosed in the copending application and the
 claimed invention were either owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of
 assignment to the same person or subject to a joint research agreement. 
 


This rejection may not be overcome by the filing of a
 terminal disclaimer. See *In re Bartfeld*, 925 F.2d 1450, 17 USPQ2d 1885
 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

 America Invents Act. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph
 **[7.03.aia](#fp7.03.aia)**.
* 2. This form paragraph is used to provisionally reject over a
 copending application with an earlier effective filing date that discloses the claimed
 invention and has not been published under **[35 U.S.C. 122](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)**. The copending
 application must have either a common assignee, common applicant (**[35 U.S.C. 118](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302910912)**)
 or at least one common joint inventor.
* 3. **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** may be applied
 if the reference names another inventor (i.e., a different inventive entity) and is one
 of the following:
	+ a U.S. patent granted under **[35 U.S.C.
	 151](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303440)** that has an effectively filed date earlier than the

	 the effective filing date of the application; or
	+ a WIPO publication of an international
	 application (PCT) or international design application that designates the United
	 States where the WIPO publication has an effectively filed date earlier than the
	 effective filing date of the application. 
	 If any of the three types of prior art documents
	 under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** issued or was
	 published before the effective filing date of the application under examination, then
	 the prior art document is also applicable under **[35 U.S.C.
	 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**.
* 4. If the claims would have been obvious over the invention
 disclosed in the other copending application, use form paragraph
 **[7.21.01.aia](#fp7.21.01.aia)**.
* 5. In bracket 1, insert claim number(s) under rejection.
* 6. In bracket 2, insert the application
 number.
* 7. In bracket 3, insert --assignee--, --applicant--, or
 --joint inventor--.
* 8. In bracket 4, provide an appropriate explanation of
 the examiner’s position on anticipation.
* 9. Under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, two patents are not
 permitted to issue on identical subject matter. Any claims in the instant application
 directed to the same invention claimed in the reference should be provisionally rejected
 using form paragraphs **[8.30](#fp8.30)** and **[8.32](#fp8.32)**. Additionally, the applicant should be required
 to amend or cancel claims such that the applied reference and the instant application no
 longer contain claims directed to the same invention using form paragraph
 **[8.27.aia](#fp8.27.aia)**.
* 10. Any claims in the instant application that are directed to
 subject matter that is not patentably distinct from an invention claimed in the
 reference should be rejected (or provisionally rejected if the reference has not yet
 issued as a patent) on the grounds of nonstatutory double patenting using form paragraph
 **[8.33](#fp8.33)** and at
 least one of form paragraphs **[8.34](#fp8.34)** - **[8.39](#fp8.39)**.
* 11. For applications claiming priority to, or the benefit of, an
 application filed before March 16, 2013, this form paragraph must be preceded by form
 paragraph **[7.06](#fp7.06)**.

 permitted to issue on identical subject matter. Any claims in the instant application
 directed to the same invention claimed in the reference should be rejected (or
 provisionally rejected if the reference has not yet issued as a patent) on the grounds
 of statutory double patenting using form paragraphs **[8.30](#fp8.30)** - **[8.32](#fp8.32)**. Additionally, the applicant should
 be required to amend or cancel claims such that the reference and the instant
 application no longer contain claims directed to the same invention using form paragraph
 **[8.27.aia](#fp8.27.aia)**.
* 10. Any claims in the instant application that are directed to
 subject matter that is not patentably distinct from an invention claimed in the
 reference should be rejected (or provisionally rejected if the reference has not yet
 issued as a patent) on the grounds of nonstatutory double patenting using form paragraph
 **[8.33](#fp8.33)** and at
 least one of form paragraphs **[8.34](#fp8.34)** - **[8.39](#fp8.39)**.

# ¶ 7.17.aia 102(a)(1) Rejection Using Prior Art Excepted under
 102(b)(2)(C)


Applicant has provided evidence in this file showing that the claimed
 invention and the subject matter disclosed in the prior art reference were owned by, or
 subject to an obligation of assignment to, the same entity as **[1]** not later than
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention, or the subject matter disclosed in the
 prior art reference was developed and the claimed invention was made by, or on behalf of one
 or more parties to a joint research agreement in effect not later than the effective filing
 date of the claimed invention. However, although reference **[2]** has been excepted
 as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, it is still applicable as prior art under

# 2152.01 Effective Filing Date of the Claimed
 Invention [R-10.2019]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** reference patent-defeating
 activities occurring before the applicant invented the claimed invention.
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** make no mention of the date
 of the invention, but instead concern documents that existed or activities that occurred
 "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention." As a result, it is no
 longer possible to antedate or "swear behind" certain prior art disclosures by making a
 showing under **[37
 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** that the applicant invented the claimed subject matter
 prior to the effective date of the prior art disclosure.
 


The AIA defines the term "effective filing date" for a
 claimed invention in a patent or application for patent (other than a reissue
 application or reissued patent) as the earliest of: (1) the actual filing date of the
 patent or the application for the patent containing the claimed invention; or (2) the
 filing date of the earliest application for which the patent or application is entitled,
 as to such invention, to a right of priority or the benefit of an earlier filing date
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**,
 **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, or **[386](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_27b56_2ab)**. See **[35 U.S.C.
 100(i)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_3b9)**. 
 


In examining applications subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, the effective filing date is the actual filing date of the
 U.S. application, unless situation (A), (B), (C), or (D) as set forth below applies.
 Note that the actual filing date of an application that entered the national stage under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)** is the international filing date (see **[35 U.S.C. 363](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306994313)**
 and **[MPEP §
 1893.03(b)](s1893.html#d0e191308)**); the actual the filing date of an international
 design application in the United States is the date of international registration
 determined by the International Bureau under the Hague Agreement (in the absence of a
 petition for review)(see **[37 CFR 1.1023](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d22557_18738_3c9)** and
 **[MPEP §
 2908](s2908.html#ch2900_d24abb_26063_251)**).
 


* (A) If the application is a continuation or divisional of one or more
 earlier U.S. applications or international applications and if the requirements of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)** have been satisfied, the effective filing date is
 the same as the earliest filing date in the line of continuation or divisional
 applications.
* (B) If the application is a continuation-in-part of an earlier U.S.
 application or international application, any claims in the new application not
 supported by the specification and claims of the parent application have an
 effective filing date equal to the actual filing date of the new application. Any
 claims which are fully supported under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** by the earlier
 parent application have the effective filing date of that earlier parent
 application.
* (C) If the application properly claims benefit under **[35 U.S.C.
 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)** to a provisional application, the effective filing
 date is the filing date of the provisional application for any claims which are
 fully supported under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)** by the
 provisional application.
* (D) If the application claims foreign priority under **[35 U.S.C.
 119(a)-(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, **[365(a) or (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307039)**, or
 **[386(a) or (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a27_324)**, the effective filing date is the filing date
 of the foreign priority document if the claim is adequately supported in the
 foreign priority document.


See **[MPEP § 1893.03(c)](s1893.html#d0e191506)** for a discussion of claims for priority to,
 or the benefit of, the filing date of a prior-filed foreign or domestic application in
 an application that entered the national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**. See
 **[MPEP §§
 211.01(c)](s211.html#ch200_d1ff71_22ea8_22b)** and **[1895](s1895.html#d0e192715)** for additional information on
 determining the effective filing date of a continuation, divisional, or
 continuation-in-part of a PCT application designating the U.S. See also
 **[MPEP §§
 1895.01](s1895.html#d0e192774)** and **[1896](s1896.html#d0e193032)** which discuss differences between
 applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302673)** and international
 applications that enter national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**.
 


See **[MPEP §§ 2920.05(d)](s2920.html#ch2900_d24abc_19867_17)** and
 **[2920.05(e)](s2920.html#ch2900_d24abc_1991a_125)** for a discussion of claims for priority to, or the
 benefit of, the filing date of a prior-filed foreign or domestic application in
 international design applications.
 


The one-year grace period (as defined in
 **[MPEP §
 2151](s2151.html#ch2100_d2002f_22873_3d8)**) in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** is measured
 from the filing date of any U.S. or foreign patent application to which the patent or
 application is entitled to benefit or priority as to such invention, whereas the
 one-year grace period in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** is measured
 from only the filing date of the earliest application filed in the United States
 (directly or through the PCT).
 


As under pre-AIA law, the effective filing date of a
 claimed invention is determined on a claim-by-claim basis and not an
 application-by-application basis. That is, the principle that different claims in the
 same application may be entitled to different effective filing dates vis-à-vis the prior
 art remains unchanged by the AIA. See **[MPEP § 2133.01](s2133.html#d0e203726)** for a discussion of
 relevant pre-AIA case law in the context of continuation-in-part applications. However,
 it is important to note that although prior art is applied on a claim-by-claim basis,
 the determination of whether **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** or **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** apply is made on an application-by-application basis.
 **[MPEP §

 date provisions of section 3 of the AIA.
 


Finally, the AIA provides that the "effective filing
 date" for a claimed invention in a reissued patent or application for a reissue patent
 shall be determined by deeming the claim to the claimed invention to have been contained
 in the patent for which reissue was sought. See **[35 U.S.C.

 of the claimed invention in a printed publication, public use of the claimed invention,
 placing the claimed invention on sale, and otherwise making the claimed invention
 available to the public. **[MPEP §§

# 2152.02(a) Patented [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** indicates that a prior patent of a claimed
 invention will preclude the grant of a subsequent patent on the claimed invention.
 This means that if a claimed invention was patented in this or a foreign country
 before the effective filing date of the claimed invention, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** precludes the grant of a patent on the claimed
 invention. The effective date of the patent for purposes of determining whether the
 patent qualifies as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is the
 grant date of the patent. There is an exception to this rule if the patent is secret
 as of the date the rights are awarded. See *In re Ekenstam,* 256
 F.2d 321, 323, 118 USPQ 349, 353 (CCPA 1958); see also **[MPEP § 2126.01](s2126.html#d0e202293)**. In
 such situations, the patent is available as prior art as of the date the patent was
 made available to the public by being laid open for public inspection or disseminated
 in printed form. See *In re Carlson,* 983 F.2d 1032, 1037, 25 USPQ2d
 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1992); see also **[MPEP § 2126](s2126.html#d0e202195)**. The phrase "patented"
 in **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** has the same meaning as "patented" in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. For a discussion of
 "patented" as used in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and
 **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, see generally **[MPEP § 2126](s2126.html#d0e202195)**.
 


Although an invention may be described in a patent and
 not claimed therein, the grant date would also be the applicable prior art date for
 purposes of relying on the subject matter disclosed therein as "described in a
 printed publication," provided that the patent was made available to the public on
 its grant date. Note that a U.S. patent that issues after the effective filing date
 of a claimed invention and is not available as prior art against that invention under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** could be available as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 




# 2152.02(b) Described in a Printed Publication [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


If a claimed invention is described in a patent,
 published patent application, or printed publication, such a document may be
 available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. Both
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** and **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** use the term "described" with respect to an invention
 in a prior art printed publication. Likewise, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** uses that term with respect to U.S. patents, U.S.
 patent application publications, and WIPO published applications. Thus, the Office
 does not view the AIA as changing the extent to which a claimed invention must be
 described for a prior art document to anticipate the claimed invention under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.
 


While the conditions for patentability of
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** require a written description of the claimed
 invention that would have enabled a person skilled in the art to make as well as use
 the invention, the prior art provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** require only that the
 claimed invention is "described" in a prior art document (patent, published patent
 application, or printed publication). The two basic requirements that must be met by
 a prior art document in order to describe a claimed invention such that it is
 anticipated under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** are the same as
 those under **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. First, "each and every element of the claimed
 invention" must be disclosed either explicitly or inherently, and the elements must
 be "arranged or combined in the same way as in the claim." See *In re
 Gleave,* 560 F.3d 1331, 1334, 90 USPQ2d 1235, 1237-38 (Fed. Cir. 2009),
 citing *Eli Lilly & Co. v. Zenith Goldline Pharms., Inc.,* 471
 F.3d 1369, 1375, 81 USPQ2d 1324,1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); *Net MoneyIN, Inc. v.
 VeriSign, Inc.,* 545 F.3d 1359, 1370, 88 USPQ2d 1751, 1759 (Fed. Cir.
 2008); *In re Bond,* 910 F.2d 831, 832-33, 15 USPQ2d 1566, 1567
 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Second, a person of ordinary skill in the art must have been
 enabled to make the invention without undue experimentation. See
 *Gleave,* 560 F.3d at 1334, 90 USPQ2d at 1238 (citing
 *Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharms. Inc.,* 545 F.3d 1312, 1314,
 88 USPQ2d 1381, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2008), and *In re LeGrice,* 301 F.2d
 929, 940-44, 133 USPQ 365, 372 (CCPA 1962)). Thus, in order for a prior art document
 to describe a claimed invention such that it is anticipated under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, it must disclose all
 elements of the claimed invention arranged as they are in the claim, and also provide
 sufficient guidance to enable a person skilled in the art to make the claimed
 invention. There is, however, no requirement that a prior art document meet the "how
 to use" requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** in order to
 qualify as prior art. See *Gleave,* 560 F.3d at 1334, 90 USPQ2d at
 1237-38; see also *In re Schoenwald,* 964 F.2d 1122, 1124, 22 USPQ2d
 1671, 1673 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (holding that a claimed compound was anticipated even
 though the prior art reference did not disclose a use for the compound);
 *Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc.,* 339 F.3d 1373, 1380-81,
 67 USPQ2d 1664, 1670 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (pointing out that actually reducing the
 invention to practice is not necessary in order for a prior art reference to
 anticipate); *Impax Labs,* 468 F.3d at 1382 (stating that "proof of
 efficacy is not required for a prior art reference to be enabling for purposes of
 anticipation"). Furthermore, compliance with the "how to make" requirement is judged
 from the viewpoint of a person of ordinary skill in the art, and thus does not
 require that the prior art document explicitly disclose information within the
 knowledge of such a person. See *In re Donohue,* 766 F.2d 531, 533,
 226 USPQ 619, 621 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 


There is an additional important distinction between
 the written description that is necessary to support a claim under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and the description sufficient to anticipate the subject
 matter of the claim under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or
 **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. See *Rasmussen v. SmithKline Beecham
 Corp.,* 413 F.3d 1318, 75 USPQ2d 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2005). To provide
 support for a claim under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, it is necessary
 that the specification describe and enable the entire scope of the claimed invention.
 However, in order for a prior art document to describe a claimed invention under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, the prior art document need only describe and enable
 one skilled in the art to make a single species or embodiment of the claimed
 invention. See *Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1562, 19
 USPQ2d 1111, 1115 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("As the court pointed out, ‘the description of a
 single embodiment of broadly claimed subject matter constitutes a description of the
 invention for anticipation purposes..., whereas the same information in a
 specification might not alone be enough to provide a description of that invention
 for purposes of adequate disclosure.’") (quoting *In re Lukach,* 442
 F.2d 967, 970, 169 USPQ 795, 797 (CCPA 1971)); see also *In re Van
 Langenhoven,* 458 F.2d 132, 173 USPQ 426 (CCPA 1972), and *In re
 Ruscetta,* 255 F.2d 687, 118 USPQ 101 (CCPA 1958). 
 


An anticipatory description it is not required in
 order for a disclosure to qualify as prior art, unless the disclosure is being used
 as the basis for an anticipation rejection. In accordance with pre-AIA case law
 concerning obviousness, a disclosure may be cited for all that it would reasonably
 have made known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the description
 requirement of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and
 **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** does not preclude an examiner from applying a
 disclosure in an obviousness rejection under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** simply because the disclosure is not adequate to anticipate
 the claimed invention.
 




# 2152.02(c) In Public Use [R-10.2019]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is
 **only applicable** to applications subject to examination under the
 first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as set forth in
 **[35
 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


Public use rejections under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** may be based on uses that are public anywhere in the
 world. While there is no requirement that the use or sale activity be by another, it
 should be noted that certain uses or sales are subject to the exceptions in
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**, e.g., uses or sales by the inventor or a
 joint inventor (or have originated with the inventor) that precede the effective
 filing date by less than one year. See **[MPEP §
 2154.02](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_139ac_31b)**.
 


Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, an
 invention that was "in public use" precluded the grant of a patent only if such
 public use occurred "in this country." See **[MPEP § 2133.03(d)](s2133.html#d0e204651)**.
 


Under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, there is
 no geographic limitation on where prior public use or public availability occurs.
 Furthermore, a public use would need to occur before the effective filing date of the
 claimed invention to constitute prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**.
 


The pre-AIA case law also indicates that a public use
 will bar patentability if the public use occurs before the critical date and the
 invention is ready for patenting. Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, the
 critical date is the date that is one year prior to the date of application for
 patent in the United States. See *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing.
 L.P.,* 424 F.3d 1374, 1379-80, 76 USPQ2d 1741, 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2005) and
 **[MPEP §
 2133](s2133.html#d0e203671)**. Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, the
 uses of an invention before the patent's critical date that constitute a "public use"
 fall into two categories: the use either "(1) was accessible to the public; or (2)
 was commercially exploited." See *American Seating Co. v. USSC Group,
 Inc.,* 514 F.3d 1262, 1267, 85 USPQ2d 1683, 1685 (Fed. Cir. 2008) and
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**. Whether a use is a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** public use also depends on who is making the use of the
 invention. "[W]hen an asserted prior use is not that of the applicant,
 **[[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C.] 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** is not a bar when that prior use or knowledge is
 not available to the public." See *Woodland Trust v. Flowertree Nursery,
 Inc.,* 148 F.3d 1368, 1371, 47 USPQ2d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In
 other words, a use by a third party who did not obtain the invention from the
 inventor named in the application or patent is an invalidating use under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** only if it falls into the first category: That
 the use was accessible to the public. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**, subsection II.C.
 On the other hand, "an inventor's own prior commercial use, albeit kept secret, may
 constitute a public use or sale under **[[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.] 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**,
 barring him from obtaining a patent." See *Woodland Trust,* 148 F.3d
 at 1370, 47 USPQ2d at 1366 and **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**, subsection II.A.
 Also, an inventor creates a public use bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** when the
 inventor shows the invention to, or allows it to be used by, another person who is
 "under no limitation, restriction, or obligation of confidentiality" to the inventor.
 See *American Seating,* 514 F.3d at 1267 and **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**,
 subsection II.B.
 


Further, under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**, "in
 order to invalidate a patent based on prior knowledge or use" by another in this
 country prior to the patent's priority date, "that knowledge or use must have been
 available to the public." See *Woodland Trust,* 148 F.3d at 1370, 47
 USPQ2d at 1366 and **[MPEP § 2132](s2132.html#d0e203390)**, subsection I. Patent-defeating "use," under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** includes only that "use which is accessible to
 the public." See *id.* (quoting *Carella v. Starlight
 Archery,* 804 F.2d 135, 139, 231 USPQ 644, 646 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).
 


As discussed previously, public use under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is limited to those uses that are available to
 the public. The public use provision of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** thus has
 the same substantive scope, with respect to uses by either the inventor or a third
 party, as public uses under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** by
 unrelated third parties or others under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**.
 


As also discussed previously, once an examiner becomes
 aware that a claimed invention has been the subject of a potentially public use, the
 examiner should require the applicant to provide information showing that the use did
 not make the claimed process accessible to the public. 
 




# 2152.02(d) On Sale [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**
 et seq. for information about on sale in regard to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


On sale rejections under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** may be based on sales or offers for sale without
 regard to where the sale activity took place. While there is no requirement that the
 sale activity be by another, it should be noted that certain uses or sales are
 subject to the exceptions in **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**, e.g., uses
 or sales by the inventor or a joint inventor (or have originated with the inventor)
 that precede the effective filing date by less than one year. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2154.02](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_139ac_31b)**.
 


The pre-AIA case law indicates that on sale activity
 will bar patentability if the claimed invention was: (1) the subject of a commercial
 sale or offer for sale, not primarily for experimental purposes; and (2) ready for
 patenting. See *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48
 USPQ2d 1641, 1646-47 (1998). Contract law and commercial law principles apply in
 order to determine whether a commercial sale or offer for sale occurred.
 *Medicines Co. v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363, 1373, 119 USPQ2d
 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (en banc). In addition, the enablement inquiry is not
 applicable to the question of whether a claimed invention is "on sale" under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. See *In re Epstein,* 32 F.3d
 1559, 1568, 31 USPQ2d 1817, 1824 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The phrase "on sale" in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is treated as having the same meaning as "on
 sale" in **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. For a discussion of "on sale" as used in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, see generally **[MPEP § 2133.03(b)](s2133.html#d0e204201)***et seq.*


Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, if an
 invention was "on sale," patentability was precluded only if the invention was on
 sale "in this country." See **[MPEP § 2133.03(d)](s2133.html#d0e204651)**. Under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, there is no geographic limitation on where
 the sale or offer for sale may occur. When formulating a rejection, Office personnel
 should consider evidence of sales activity, regardless of where the sale activity
 took place.
 


The **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** "on
 sale" provision has been interpreted as including commercial activity even if the
 activity is secret. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(b)](s2133.html#d0e204201)**, subsection III.A.
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** uses the same "on sale" term as
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** and is treated as having the same meaning. In
 *Helsinn Healthcare S.A. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,* 139
 S.Ct. 628 (2019), the Supreme Court "determine[d] that Congress did not alter the
 meaning of ‘on sale’ when it enacted the AIA, [and held] that an inventor’s sale of
 an invention to a third party who is obligated to keep the invention confidential can
 qualify as prior art under [AIA 35 U.S.C.] § 102(a)." *Id.* at 634.
 Thus, a sale or offer for sale that does not disclose the subject matter of an
 invention or make the invention available to the general public may nevertheless
 qualify as prior art in an anticipation or obviousness rejection, regardless of
 whether the application or patent under consideration is subject to the FITF
 provisions of the AIA or the first to invent provisions of pre-AIA law.
 




# 2152.02(e) Otherwise Available to the Public [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** provides a "catch-all" provision, which
 defines a new additional category of potential prior art not provided for in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Specifically, a claimed invention is not entitled
 to a patent if it was "otherwise available to the public" before its effective filing
 date. This "catch-all" provision permits decision makers to focus on whether the
 disclosure was "available to the public," rather than on the means by which the
 claimed invention became available to the public or whether a disclosure constitutes
 a "printed publication" or falls within another category of prior art as defined in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. The availability of the subject matter to the
 public may arise in situations such as a student thesis in a university library (see,
 e.g., *In re Cronyn,* 890 F.2d 1158, 13 USPQ2d 1070 (Fed. Cir.
 1989); *In re Hall,* 781 F.2d 897, 228 USPQ 453 (Fed. Cir. 1986);
 *In re Bayer,* 568 F.2d 1357, 196 USPQ 670 (CCPA 1978) and
 **[MPEP §
 2128.01](s2128.html#d0e202706)**, subsection I.); a poster display or other
 information disseminated at a scientific meeting (see, e.g., *In re
 Klopfenstein,* 380 F.3d 1345, 72 USPQ2d 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2004),
 *Massachusetts Institute of Technology v. AB Fortia,* 774 F.2d
 1104, 227 USPQ 428 (Fed. Cir. 1985), *Jazz Pharm., Inc. v. Amneal Pharm.,
 LLC*, 895 F.3d 1347,127 USPQ2d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 2018), and
 **[MPEP §
 2128.01](s2128.html#d0e202706)**, subsection IV.); subject matter in a laid-open
 patent application or patent (see, e.g., *In re Wyer,* 655 F.2d 221,
 210 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1981); see also *Bruckelmyer v. Ground Heaters,
 Inc.,* 445 F.3d 1374, 78 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 2006)); a document
 electronically posted on the Internet (see, e.g., *Voter Verified, Inc. v.
 Premier Election Solutions, Inc.,* 698 F.3d 1374, 104 USPQ2d 1553 (Fed.
 Cir. 2012), *In re Lister,* 583 F.3d 1307, 92 USPQ2d 1225 (Fed. Cir.
 2009), *SRI Int'l, Inc. v. Internet Sec. Sys., Inc.,* 511 F.3d 1186,
 85 USPQ2d 1489 (Fed. Cir. 2008), and **[MPEP § 2128](s2128.html#d0e202564)**); or a commercial
 transaction that does not constitute a sale under the Uniform Commercial Code (see,
 e.g., *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041, 59
 USPQ2d 1121 (Fed. Cir. 2001) and **[MPEP § 2133.03(e)(1)](s2133.html#d0e204712)**). Even if a
 document or other disclosure is not a printed publication, or a transaction is not a
 sale, either may be prior art under the "otherwise available to the public" provision
 of **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, provided that the claimed invention is made
 sufficiently available to the public. 
 




# 2152.02(f) No Requirement of "By Others" [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See

A key difference between **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is the
 requirement in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** that the prior art relied on was "by
 others." Under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, there is
 no requirement that the prior art relied upon be by others. Thus, any prior art which
 falls under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** need not
 be by another to constitute potentially available prior art. However, disclosures of
 the subject matter made one year or less before the effective filing date of the
 claimed invention by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor may fall
 within an exception under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** to

# 2152.02(a) Patented [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application

 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** indicates that a prior patent of a claimed
 invention will preclude the grant of a subsequent patent on the claimed invention.
 This means that if a claimed invention was patented in this or a foreign country
 before the effective filing date of the claimed invention, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** precludes the grant of a patent on the claimed
 invention. The effective date of the patent for purposes of determining whether the
 patent qualifies as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is the
 grant date of the patent. There is an exception to this rule if the patent is secret
 as of the date the rights are awarded. See *In re Ekenstam,* 256
 F.2d 321, 323, 118 USPQ 349, 353 (CCPA 1958); see also **[MPEP § 2126.01](s2126.html#d0e202293)**. In
 such situations, the patent is available as prior art as of the date the patent was
 made available to the public by being laid open for public inspection or disseminated
 in printed form. See *In re Carlson,* 983 F.2d 1032, 1037, 25 USPQ2d
 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1992); see also **[MPEP § 2126](s2126.html#d0e202195)**. The phrase "patented"
 in **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** has the same meaning as "patented" in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. For a discussion of
 "patented" as used in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and

Although an invention may be described in a patent and
 not claimed therein, the grant date would also be the applicable prior art date for
 purposes of relying on the subject matter disclosed therein as "described in a
 printed publication," provided that the patent was made available to the public on
 its grant date. Note that a U.S. patent that issues after the effective filing date
 of a claimed invention and is not available as prior art against that invention under
 **[AIA 35

# 2152.02(b) Described in a Printed Publication [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


If a claimed invention is described in a patent,
 published patent application, or printed publication, such a document may be
 available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. Both
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** and **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** use the term "described" with respect to an invention
 in a prior art printed publication. Likewise, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** uses that term with respect to U.S. patents, U.S.
 patent application publications, and WIPO published applications. Thus, the Office
 does not view the AIA as changing the extent to which a claimed invention must be
 described for a prior art document to anticipate the claimed invention under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.
 


While the conditions for patentability of
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** require a written description of the claimed
 invention that would have enabled a person skilled in the art to make as well as use
 the invention, the prior art provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** require only that the
 claimed invention is "described" in a prior art document (patent, published patent
 application, or printed publication). The two basic requirements that must be met by
 a prior art document in order to describe a claimed invention such that it is
 anticipated under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** are the same as
 those under **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. First, "each and every element of the claimed
 invention" must be disclosed either explicitly or inherently, and the elements must
 be "arranged or combined in the same way as in the claim." See *In re
 Gleave,* 560 F.3d 1331, 1334, 90 USPQ2d 1235, 1237-38 (Fed. Cir. 2009),
 citing *Eli Lilly & Co. v. Zenith Goldline Pharms., Inc.,* 471
 F.3d 1369, 1375, 81 USPQ2d 1324,1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); *Net MoneyIN, Inc. v.
 VeriSign, Inc.,* 545 F.3d 1359, 1370, 88 USPQ2d 1751, 1759 (Fed. Cir.
 2008); *In re Bond,* 910 F.2d 831, 832-33, 15 USPQ2d 1566, 1567
 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Second, a person of ordinary skill in the art must have been
 enabled to make the invention without undue experimentation. See
 *Gleave,* 560 F.3d at 1334, 90 USPQ2d at 1238 (citing
 *Impax Labs., Inc. v. Aventis Pharms. Inc.,* 545 F.3d 1312, 1314,
 88 USPQ2d 1381, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2008), and *In re LeGrice,* 301 F.2d
 929, 940-44, 133 USPQ 365, 372 (CCPA 1962)). Thus, in order for a prior art document
 to describe a claimed invention such that it is anticipated under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, it must disclose all
 elements of the claimed invention arranged as they are in the claim, and also provide
 sufficient guidance to enable a person skilled in the art to make the claimed
 invention. There is, however, no requirement that a prior art document meet the "how
 to use" requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** in order to
 qualify as prior art. See *Gleave,* 560 F.3d at 1334, 90 USPQ2d at
 1237-38; see also *In re Schoenwald,* 964 F.2d 1122, 1124, 22 USPQ2d
 1671, 1673 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (holding that a claimed compound was anticipated even
 though the prior art reference did not disclose a use for the compound);
 *Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc.,* 339 F.3d 1373, 1380-81,
 67 USPQ2d 1664, 1670 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (pointing out that actually reducing the
 invention to practice is not necessary in order for a prior art reference to
 anticipate); *Impax Labs,* 468 F.3d at 1382 (stating that "proof of
 efficacy is not required for a prior art reference to be enabling for purposes of
 anticipation"). Furthermore, compliance with the "how to make" requirement is judged
 from the viewpoint of a person of ordinary skill in the art, and thus does not
 require that the prior art document explicitly disclose information within the
 knowledge of such a person. See *In re Donohue,* 766 F.2d 531, 533,
 226 USPQ 619, 621 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 


There is an additional important distinction between
 the written description that is necessary to support a claim under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and the description sufficient to anticipate the subject
 matter of the claim under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or
 **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. See *Rasmussen v. SmithKline Beecham
 Corp.,* 413 F.3d 1318, 75 USPQ2d 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2005). To provide
 support for a claim under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, it is necessary
 that the specification describe and enable the entire scope of the claimed invention.
 However, in order for a prior art document to describe a claimed invention under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, the prior art document need only describe and enable
 one skilled in the art to make a single species or embodiment of the claimed
 invention. See *Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1562, 19
 USPQ2d 1111, 1115 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("As the court pointed out, ‘the description of a
 single embodiment of broadly claimed subject matter constitutes a description of the
 invention for anticipation purposes..., whereas the same information in a
 specification might not alone be enough to provide a description of that invention
 for purposes of adequate disclosure.’") (quoting *In re Lukach,* 442
 F.2d 967, 970, 169 USPQ 795, 797 (CCPA 1971)); see also *In re Van
 Langenhoven,* 458 F.2d 132, 173 USPQ 426 (CCPA 1972), and *In re
 Ruscetta,* 255 F.2d 687, 118 USPQ 101 (CCPA 1958). 
 


An anticipatory description it is not required in
 order for a disclosure to qualify as prior art, unless the disclosure is being used
 as the basis for an anticipation rejection. In accordance with pre-AIA case law
 concerning obviousness, a disclosure may be cited for all that it would reasonably
 have made known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the description
 requirement of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and
 **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** does not preclude an examiner from applying a
 disclosure in an obviousness rejection under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** simply because the disclosure is not adequate to anticipate
 the claimed invention.

# 2152.02(c) In Public Use [R-10.2019]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is
 **only applicable** to applications subject to examination under the
 first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as set forth in
 **[35
 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


Public use rejections under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** may be based on uses that are public anywhere in the
 world. While there is no requirement that the use or sale activity be by another, it
 should be noted that certain uses or sales are subject to the exceptions in
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**, e.g., uses or sales by the inventor or a
 joint inventor (or have originated with the inventor) that precede the effective
 filing date by less than one year. See **[MPEP §
 2154.02](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_139ac_31b)**.
 


Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, an
 invention that was "in public use" precluded the grant of a patent only if such
 public use occurred "in this country." See **[MPEP § 2133.03(d)](s2133.html#d0e204651)**.
 


Under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, there is
 no geographic limitation on where prior public use or public availability occurs.
 Furthermore, a public use would need to occur before the effective filing date of the
 claimed invention to constitute prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**.
 


The pre-AIA case law also indicates that a public use
 will bar patentability if the public use occurs before the critical date and the
 invention is ready for patenting. Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, the
 critical date is the date that is one year prior to the date of application for
 patent in the United States. See *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing.
 L.P.,* 424 F.3d 1374, 1379-80, 76 USPQ2d 1741, 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2005) and
 **[MPEP §
 2133](s2133.html#d0e203671)**. Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, the
 uses of an invention before the patent's critical date that constitute a "public use"
 fall into two categories: the use either "(1) was accessible to the public; or (2)
 was commercially exploited." See *American Seating Co. v. USSC Group,
 Inc.,* 514 F.3d 1262, 1267, 85 USPQ2d 1683, 1685 (Fed. Cir. 2008) and
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**. Whether a use is a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** public use also depends on who is making the use of the
 invention. "[W]hen an asserted prior use is not that of the applicant,
 **[[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C.] 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** is not a bar when that prior use or knowledge is
 not available to the public." See *Woodland Trust v. Flowertree Nursery,
 Inc.,* 148 F.3d 1368, 1371, 47 USPQ2d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In
 other words, a use by a third party who did not obtain the invention from the
 inventor named in the application or patent is an invalidating use under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** only if it falls into the first category: That
 the use was accessible to the public. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**, subsection II.C.
 On the other hand, "an inventor's own prior commercial use, albeit kept secret, may
 constitute a public use or sale under **[[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.] 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**,
 barring him from obtaining a patent." See *Woodland Trust,* 148 F.3d
 at 1370, 47 USPQ2d at 1366 and **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**, subsection II.A.
 Also, an inventor creates a public use bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** when the
 inventor shows the invention to, or allows it to be used by, another person who is
 "under no limitation, restriction, or obligation of confidentiality" to the inventor.
 See *American Seating,* 514 F.3d at 1267 and **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)**,
 subsection II.B.
 


Further, under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**, "in
 order to invalidate a patent based on prior knowledge or use" by another in this
 country prior to the patent's priority date, "that knowledge or use must have been
 available to the public." See *Woodland Trust,* 148 F.3d at 1370, 47
 USPQ2d at 1366 and **[MPEP § 2132](s2132.html#d0e203390)**, subsection I. Patent-defeating "use," under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** includes only that "use which is accessible to
 the public." See *id.* (quoting *Carella v. Starlight
 Archery,* 804 F.2d 135, 139, 231 USPQ 644, 646 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).
 


As discussed previously, public use under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is limited to those uses that are available to
 the public. The public use provision of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** thus has
 the same substantive scope, with respect to uses by either the inventor or a third
 party, as public uses under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** by
 unrelated third parties or others under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**.
 


As also discussed previously, once an examiner becomes
 aware that a claimed invention has been the subject of a potentially public use, the
 examiner should require the applicant to provide information showing that the use did
 not make the claimed process accessible to the public.

# 2152.02(d) On Sale [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**
 et seq. for information about on sale in regard to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


On sale rejections under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** may be based on sales or offers for sale without
 regard to where the sale activity took place. While there is no requirement that the
 sale activity be by another, it should be noted that certain uses or sales are
 subject to the exceptions in **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**, e.g., uses
 or sales by the inventor or a joint inventor (or have originated with the inventor)
 that precede the effective filing date by less than one year. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2154.02](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_139ac_31b)**.
 


The pre-AIA case law indicates that on sale activity
 will bar patentability if the claimed invention was: (1) the subject of a commercial
 sale or offer for sale, not primarily for experimental purposes; and (2) ready for
 patenting. See *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48
 USPQ2d 1641, 1646-47 (1998). Contract law and commercial law principles apply in
 order to determine whether a commercial sale or offer for sale occurred.
 *Medicines Co. v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363, 1373, 119 USPQ2d
 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (en banc). In addition, the enablement inquiry is not
 applicable to the question of whether a claimed invention is "on sale" under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. See *In re Epstein,* 32 F.3d
 1559, 1568, 31 USPQ2d 1817, 1824 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The phrase "on sale" in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is treated as having the same meaning as "on
 sale" in **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**. For a discussion of "on sale" as used in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, see generally **[MPEP § 2133.03(b)](s2133.html#d0e204201)***et seq.*


Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, if an
 invention was "on sale," patentability was precluded only if the invention was on
 sale "in this country." See **[MPEP § 2133.03(d)](s2133.html#d0e204651)**. Under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, there is no geographic limitation on where
 the sale or offer for sale may occur. When formulating a rejection, Office personnel
 should consider evidence of sales activity, regardless of where the sale activity
 took place.
 


The **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** "on
 sale" provision has been interpreted as including commercial activity even if the
 activity is secret. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(b)](s2133.html#d0e204201)**, subsection III.A.
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** uses the same "on sale" term as
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** and is treated as having the same meaning. In
 *Helsinn Healthcare S.A. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.,* 139
 S.Ct. 628 (2019), the Supreme Court "determine[d] that Congress did not alter the
 meaning of ‘on sale’ when it enacted the AIA, [and held] that an inventor’s sale of
 an invention to a third party who is obligated to keep the invention confidential can
 qualify as prior art under [AIA 35 U.S.C.] § 102(a)." *Id.* at 634.
 Thus, a sale or offer for sale that does not disclose the subject matter of an
 invention or make the invention available to the general public may nevertheless
 qualify as prior art in an anticipation or obviousness rejection, regardless of
 whether the application or patent under consideration is subject to the FITF
 provisions of the AIA or the first to invent provisions of pre-AIA law.

# 2152.02(e) Otherwise Available to the Public [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application

 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** provides a "catch-all" provision, which
 defines a new additional category of potential prior art not provided for in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Specifically, a claimed invention is not entitled
 to a patent if it was "otherwise available to the public" before its effective filing
 date. This "catch-all" provision permits decision makers to focus on whether the
 disclosure was "available to the public," rather than on the means by which the
 claimed invention became available to the public or whether a disclosure constitutes
 a "printed publication" or falls within another category of prior art as defined in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. The availability of the subject matter to the
 public may arise in situations such as a student thesis in a university library (see,
 e.g., *In re Cronyn,* 890 F.2d 1158, 13 USPQ2d 1070 (Fed. Cir.
 1989); *In re Hall,* 781 F.2d 897, 228 USPQ 453 (Fed. Cir. 1986);
 *In re Bayer,* 568 F.2d 1357, 196 USPQ 670 (CCPA 1978) and
 **[MPEP §
 2128.01](s2128.html#d0e202706)**, subsection I.); a poster display or other
 information disseminated at a scientific meeting (see, e.g., *In re
 Klopfenstein,* 380 F.3d 1345, 72 USPQ2d 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2004),
 *Massachusetts Institute of Technology v. AB Fortia,* 774 F.2d

 **[MPEP §
 2128.01](s2128.html#d0e202706)**, subsection IV.); subject matter in a laid-open
 patent application or patent (see, e.g., *In re Wyer,* 655 F.2d 221,
 210 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1981); see also *Bruckelmyer v. Ground Heaters,
 Inc.,* 445 F.3d 1374, 78 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 2006)); a document
 electronically posted on the Internet (see, e.g., *Voter Verified, Inc. v.

 85 USPQ2d 1489 (Fed. Cir. 2008), and **[MPEP § 2128](s2128.html#d0e202564)**); or a commercial
 transaction that does not constitute a sale under the Uniform Commercial Code (see,
 e.g., *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041, 59
 USPQ2d 1121 (Fed. Cir. 2001) and **[MPEP § 2133.03(e)(1)](s2133.html#d0e204712)**). Even if a
 document or other disclosure is not a printed publication, or a transaction is not a
 sale, either may be prior art under the "otherwise available to the public" provision
 of **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, provided that the claimed invention is made
 sufficiently available to the public.

 within an exception under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** to

The Office will continue to treat admissions by the
 applicant as prior art under the AIA. A statement by an applicant in the specification
 or made during prosecution identifying the work of another as "prior art" is an
 admission which can be relied upon for both anticipation and obviousness determinations,
 regardless of whether the admitted prior art would otherwise qualify as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**. See *Riverwood Int'l Corp. v. R.A. Jones &
 Co.,* 324 F.3d 1346, 1354, 66 USPQ2d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2003);

# 2152.04 The Meaning of "Disclosure" [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]* 


The AIA does not define the term "disclosure," and
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** does not use the term "disclosure."
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** and **[(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)**, however, each state
 conditions under which a "disclosure" that otherwise falls within **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** is not prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or **[102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Thus, the Office is
 treating the term "disclosure" as a generic expression intended to encompass the
 documents and activities enumerated in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** (i.e., being
 patented, described in a printed publication, in public use, on sale, or otherwise
 available to the public, or being described in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application
 publication, or WIPO published application).

# 2152.05 Determining Whether To Apply 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1) or 102(a)(2) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA as
 explained in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)**. See **[MPEP §
 2139.02](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_125d3_2ef)** for examination of applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*

**I.** **35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)**First, the examiner should consider whether the
 reference qualifies as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. Next the
 examiner must determine if any exceptions in **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** apply. 
 


Patents claiming or describing the claimed inventions,
 descriptions of the claimed invention in a printed publication, public use of the
 claimed invention, placing the claimed invention on sale, and otherwise making the
 claimed invention available to the public qualify as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if the reference predates the effective filing
 date of the claim. The sale or use of the invention need not occur in the United
 States to qualify. See **[MPEP § 2152](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_18e23_3ce)**.
 


Potential references may be excepted as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** when the inventor’s own work has been
 publicly disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor.
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** provides that a disclosure which would
 otherwise qualify as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** is not prior
 art if the disclosure was made: (1) One year or less before the effective filing date
 of the claimed invention; and (2) by the inventor or a joint inventor, or by another
 who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor. See **[MPEP §§ 2153.01(a)](s2153.html#ch2100_d20033_24e66_2ac)** and
 **[2153.01(b)](s2153.html#ch2100_d20033_256f4_147)**.
 


Potential references may also be excepted as prior art
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** if the reference discloses subject matter
 that was publicly disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who
 obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor. Specifically, **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** provides
 that a disclosure which would otherwise qualify as prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** (patent, printed publication, public use, sale, or
 other means of public availability) may be excepted as prior art if: (1) The
 disclosure was made one year or less before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention; and (2) the subject matter disclosed had been previously publicly
 disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who obtained the subject
 matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor. See
 **[MPEP
 §§ 2153.02](s2153.html#ch2100_d20033_25935_125)** and **[717.01(b)(2)](s717.html#ch700_d1ffd5_19bbd_19a)**.
 

**II.** **35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)**First, the examiner should consider whether the
 reference qualifies as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Next the
 examiner must determine if any exceptions in **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** apply. 
 


U.S. patents, U.S. patent applications published under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)**, and international patent applications published under
 the Patent Cooperation Treaty to another are prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the filing or effective filing date of the
 disclosure of the reference is before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention. Even if the issue or publication date of the reference is not before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention, the reference may still be applicable
 as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if it was
 "effectively filed" before the effective filing date of the claimed invention with
 respect to the subject matter relied upon to reject the claim. **[MPEP §
 2152.01](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1afb3_e6)** discusses the "effective filing date" of a claimed
 invention. **[35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** sets forth the
 criteria to determine when subject matter described in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent
 application publication, or WIPO published application was "effectively filed" for
 purposes of **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2154](s2154.html#ch2100_d20033_274f5_338)**.
 


Potential references may be excepted as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** by the three exception provisions of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)**. **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** limits the
 use of an inventor’s own work as prior art, when the inventor’s own work is disclosed
 in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO published application
 by another who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor
 or joint inventor. **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** excepts as
 prior art subject matter that was effectively filed by another after the subject
 matter had been publicly disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who
 obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor. **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** excepts subject matter disclosed in a
 U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO published application from
 constituting prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the
 subject matter disclosed and the claimed invention, not later than the effective
 filing date of the claimed invention, "were owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person." **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** resembles **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** in that
 both concern common ownership, and both offer an avenue by which an applicant may
 avoid certain prior art. However, there are significant differences between
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**. See

In addition to persuasively arguing that the claims are
 patentably distinguishable over the prior art or amending the claims to overcome the
 prior art rejection, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or

# 2152.07 Form Paragraphs for Use in Rejections Under AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102 [R-10.2019]


The following form paragraphs should be used in making
 the appropriate rejections. Note that the particular part of the reference relied upon
 to support the rejection should be identified. 
 


# ¶ 7.06 Notice re prior art available under both pre-AIA and
 AIA


In the event the determination of the status of the application as subject
 to AIA **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** (or as subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**)
 is incorrect, any correction of the statutory basis for the rejection will not be considered a
 new ground of rejection if the prior art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the
 rejection, would be the same under either status.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1.  This form paragraph must be used in all Office
 Actions when a prior art rejection is made in an application with an actual filing
 date on or after March 16, 2013, that claims priority to, or the benefit of, an
 application filed before March 16, 2013.
* 2.  This form paragraph should only be used ONCE in an
 Office action.



# ¶ 7.07.aia Statement of Statutory Basis, 35 U.S.C. 102


The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs
 of **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** that form the basis for the rejections under this section made in
 this Office action:
 


A person shall be entitled to a patent
 unless—
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. The statute is no longer being re-cited in all
 Office actions. It is only required in first actions on the merits and final rejections.
 Where the statute is not being cited in an action on the merits, use form paragraph
 **[7.103](#fp7.103)**.
* 2. Form paragraphs **[7.07.aia](#fp7.07.aia)**, **[7.08.aia](#fp7.08.aia)**, **[7.12.aia](#fp7.12.aia)** and
 **[7.14.aia](#fp7.14.aia)** are to be used ONLY ONCE in a given Office
 action.
* 3. For applications claiming priority to, or the
 benefit of, an application filed before March 16, 2013, this form paragraph must be
 preceded by form paragraph **[7.06](#fp7.06)**.



# ¶ 7.08.aia 102(a)(1), Activity Before the Effective Filing Date of
 Claimed Invention


(a)(1) the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed
 publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention. 
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This form paragraph should only be used in an
 application filed on or after March 16, 2013, where the claims are being examined under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**/**[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** as amended by the Leahy-Smith

# ¶ 7.14.aia Pre-AIA 102(g), Priority of Invention


(g)(1) during the course of an interference conducted under
 section **[135](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19834_19b)** or section **[291](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306203)**, another inventor involved therein
 establishes, to the extent permitted in section **[104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**, that before such person’s invention
 thereof the invention was made by such other inventor and not abandoned, suppressed, or
 concealed, or (2) before such person’s invention thereof, the invention was made in this
 country by another inventor who had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it. In determining
 priority of invention under this subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective
 dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the reasonable
 diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to practice, from a time prior
 to conception by the other.
 


A rejection on this statutory basis (**[35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**

 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** as being anticipated by copending Application No.
 **[2]** which has a common **[3]** with the instant application.
 


Based upon the earlier effective filing date of the
 copending application, it would constitute prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, if published under **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)** or patented under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 151](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303440)**. This provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** is based upon a presumption of future publication or patenting
 of the copending application. **[4]**.
 


This provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** might be overcome by: (1) a showing under **[37 CFR 1.130(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323473)** that the
 subject matter disclosed in the copending application was obtained directly or indirectly from
 the inventor or a joint inventor of this application and is thus not prior art in accordance
 with **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1a7)**; (2) a showing under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** of a prior public
 disclosure under **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)**; or (3) a statement pursuant to
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** establishing that, not later than the effective filing date
 of the claimed invention, the subject matter disclosed in the copending application and the
 claimed invention were either owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of
 assignment to the same person or subject to a joint research agreement. 
 


This rejection may not be overcome by the filing of a
 terminal disclaimer. See *In re Bartfeld*, 925 F.2d 1450, 17 USPQ2d 1885
 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

	 If any of the three types of prior art documents
	 under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** issued or was
	 published before the effective filing date of the application under examination, then
	 the prior art document is also applicable under **[35 U.S.C.
	 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**.
* 4. If the claims would have been obvious over the invention
 disclosed in the other copending application, use form paragraph
 **[7.21.01.aia](#fp7.21.01.aia)**.
* 5. In bracket 1, insert claim number(s) under rejection.
* 6. In bracket 2, insert the application
 number.
* 7. In bracket 3, insert --assignee--, --applicant--, or

* 8. In bracket 4, provide an appropriate explanation of
 the examiner’s position on anticipation.
* 9. Under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, two patents are not
 permitted to issue on identical subject matter. Any claims in the instant application
 directed to the same invention claimed in the reference should be provisionally rejected
 using form paragraphs **[8.30](#fp8.30)** and **[8.32](#fp8.32)**. Additionally, the applicant should be required
 to amend or cancel claims such that the applied reference and the instant application no
 longer contain claims directed to the same invention using form paragraph
 **[8.27.aia](#fp8.27.aia)**.
* 10. Any claims in the instant application that are directed to
 subject matter that is not patentably distinct from an invention claimed in the
 reference should be rejected (or provisionally rejected if the reference has not yet
 issued as a patent) on the grounds of nonstatutory double patenting using form paragraph
 **[8.33](#fp8.33)** and at
 least one of form paragraphs **[8.34](#fp8.34)** - **[8.39](#fp8.39)**.
* 11. For applications claiming priority to, or the benefit of, an
 application filed before March 16, 2013, this form paragraph must be preceded by form
 paragraph **[7.06](#fp7.06)**.
