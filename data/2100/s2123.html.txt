# 2123 Rejection Over Prior Art’s Broad Disclosure Instead of Preferred
 Embodiments [R-08.2012]

**I.** **PATENTS ARE RELEVANT AS PRIOR ART FOR ALL THEY CONTAIN**"The use of patents as references is not limited to what the patentees
 describe as their own inventions or to the problems with which they are concerned. They
 are part of the literature of the art, relevant for all they contain." *In re
 Heck,* 699 F.2d 1331, 1332-33, 216 USPQ 1038, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quoting
  *In re Lemelson,* 397 F.2d 1006, 1009, 158 USPQ 275, 277 (CCPA
 1968)). 
 


A reference may be relied upon for all that it would have reasonably
 suggested to one having ordinary skill the art, including nonpreferred embodiments.
 *Merck & Co. v.**Biocraft Laboratories,* 874 F.2d 804, 10 USPQ2d 1843 (Fed. Cir.),
 *cert. denied,* 493 U.S. 975 (1989). See also *Upsher-Smith
 Labs. v. Pamlab, LLC,* 412 F.3d 1319, 1323, 75 USPQ2d 1213, 1215 (Fed. Cir.
 2005) (reference disclosing optional inclusion of a particular component teaches
 compositions that both do and do not contain that component); *Celeritas
 Technologies Ltd. v. Rockwell International Corp.,* 150 F.3d 1354, 1361, 47
 USPQ2d 1516, 1522-23 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The court held that the prior art anticipated the
 claims even though it taught away from the claimed invention. "The fact that a modem
 with a single carrier data signal is shown to be less than optimal does not vitiate the
 fact that it is disclosed.").
 


See also **[MPEP § 2131.05](s2131.html#d0e203351)** and **[§ 2145](s2145.html#d0e212553)**, subsection X.D., which discuss
 prior art that teaches away from the claimed invention in the context of anticipation
 and obviousness, respectively.
 

**II.** **NONPREFERRED AND ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS CONSTITUTE PRIOR ART**Disclosed examples and preferred embodiments do not constitute a
 teaching away from a broader disclosure or nonpreferred embodiments. *In re
 Susi,* 440 F.2d 442, 169 USPQ 423 (CCPA 1971). "A known or obvious
 composition does not become patentable simply because it has been described as somewhat
 inferior to some other product for the same use." *In re Gurley,* 27
 F.3d 551, 554, 31 USPQ2d 1130, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (The invention was directed to an
 epoxy impregnated fiber-reinforced printed circuit material. The applied prior art
 reference taught a printed circuit material similar to that of the claims but
 impregnated with polyester-imide resin instead of epoxy. The reference, however,
 disclosed that epoxy was known for this use, but that epoxy impregnated circuit boards
 have "relatively acceptable dimensional stability" and "some degree of flexibility," but
 are inferior to circuit boards impregnated with polyester-imide resins. The court upheld
 the rejection concluding that applicant’s argument that the reference teaches away from
 using epoxy was insufficient to overcome the rejection since "Gurley asserted no
 discovery beyond what was known in the art." *Id.* at 554, 31 USPQ2d at
 1132.). Furthermore, "[t]he prior art’s mere disclosure of more than one alternative
 does not constitute a teaching away from any of these alternatives because such
 disclosure does not criticize, discredit, or otherwise discourage the solution
 claimed…." *In re Fulton,* 391 F.3d 1195, 1201, 73 USPQ2d 1141, 1146
 (Fed. Cir. 2004).
