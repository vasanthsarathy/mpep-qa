# 2151 Overview of the Changes to 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 in
 the AIA [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as
 set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP ยง
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is subject to
 examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP ยง 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP ยง 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for
 examination of applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


After the AIA, **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** continues to set forth
 the scope of prior art that will preclude the grant of a patent on a claimed invention, but
 revises what qualifies as prior art. Specifically, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** and **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** set forth what qualifies as
 prior art. **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** provides that a person is not entitled to a
 patent if the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in
 public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date
 of the claimed invention. **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** provides that a
 person is not entitled to a patent if the claimed invention was described in a patent
 issued under **[35 U.S.C.
 151](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303440)**, or in an application for patent published or deemed published
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)**, in which the patent or application, as the case may be, names
 another inventor, and was effectively filed before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention. **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)** sets forth exceptions to prior art established in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)**. Specifically, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** sets forth exceptions to prior art established in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, and **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** sets forth
 exceptions to prior art established in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 


The AIA also provides definitions in **[35 U.S.C. 100](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302338313)** of
 the meaning of the terms "claimed invention," "effective filing date," "inventor," and
 "joint inventor" (or "coinventor"). The AIA defines the term "claimed invention" in
 **[35 U.S.C.
 100(j)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e22_345)** as the subject matter defined by a claim in a patent or an
 application for a patent. The AIA defines the term "effective filing date" for a claimed
 invention in a patent or application for patent (other than a reissue application or
 reissued patent) in **[35 U.S.C. 100(i)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_3b9)** as meaning the
 earlier of: (1) The actual filing date of the patent or the application for the patent
 containing the claimed invention; or (2) the filing date of the earliest provisional,
 nonprovisional, international (PCT), or foreign patent application to which the patent or
 application is entitled to benefit or priority as to such claimed invention. The AIA
 defines the term "inventor" in **[35 U.S.C. 100(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302367313)** as the individual or,
 if a joint invention, the individuals collectively who invented or discovered the subject
 matter of the invention, and in **[35 U.S.C. 100(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e0c_133)** defines the term
 "joint inventor" and "coinventor" to mean any one of the individuals who invented or
 discovered the subject matter of a joint invention.
 


As discussed previously, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** provides that a person is not entitled to a patent if the
 claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on
 sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention. Under **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, knowledge or use of the invention
 (**[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**), or public use or sale of the invention (**[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**), was required to be in the United States to qualify as a
 prior art activity. Under the AIA, a prior public use, sale activity, or other disclosure
 has no geographic requirement (i.e., need not be in the United States) to qualify as prior
 art.
 


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** provides that certain disclosures made one year or less
 before the effective filing date of a claimed invention shall not be prior art under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** with respect to the claimed invention if: (1) The
 disclosure was made by the inventor or joint inventor or by another who obtained the
 subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor; or
 (2) the subject matter disclosed had, before such disclosure, been publicly disclosed by
 the inventor or a joint inventor or by another who obtained the subject matter disclosed
 directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor. Thus, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** effectively provides a one-year grace period (grace period)
 after a first inventor-originated disclosure of an invention within which the inventor,
 assignee, obligated assignee, or other party having sufficient interest may file a patent
 application which is not subject to such disclosure and certain other disclosures as prior
 art. The one-year grace period in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)** is measured
 from the filing date of the earliest U.S. or foreign patent application to which a proper
 benefit or priority claim to such invention has been asserted in the patent or application
 and the earlier application supports the claimed invention in the manner required by
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the one-year
 grace period is measured from the filing date of the earliest application filed in the
 United States (directly or through the PCT) and not from the dates of earlier filed foreign
 patent applications.
 


The date of invention is not relevant under
 **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**. Thus, a prior art disclosure could not be disqualified or
 antedated by showing that the inventor invented the claimed invention prior to the
 effective date of the prior art disclosure of the subject matter (e.g., under the
 provisions of **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**).
 


As discussed previously, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** provides that a person is not entitled to a patent if the
 claimed invention was described in a U.S. patent, a U.S. patent application publication, or
 an application for patent deemed published under **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)** (collectively referred
 to as "U.S. patent documents"), that names another inventor and was effectively filed
 before the effective filing date of the claimed invention. Under **[35 U.S.C. 374](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307311313)**, a
 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) publication of a Patent Cooperation Treaty
 (PCT) international application that designates the United States is an application for
 patent deemed published under **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)** for purposes of
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Thus, under the AIA, WIPO publications of PCT
 applications that designate the United States are treated as U.S. patent application
 publications for prior art purposes, regardless of the international filing date, whether
 they are published in English, or whether the PCT international application enters the
 national stage in the United States. Accordingly, a WIPO publication of a PCT application
 (WIPO published application) that designates the United States, a U.S. patent, or a U.S.
 patent application publication that names another inventor and was effectively filed before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention, is prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, a WIPO
 published application designating the United States is treated as a U.S. patent application
 publication only if the PCT application was filed on or after November 29, 2000, and
 published under **[PCT
 Article 21(2)](mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e363634)** in the English language. See **[MPEP ยง 2136.03](s2136.html#d0e205924)**,
 subsection III.
 


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** defines "effectively filed" for the purpose of determining
 whether a particular U.S. patent document is prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** to a claimed invention. A U.S. patent document is
 considered to have been effectively filed for purposes of its prior art effect under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** with respect to any subject matter it describes on the
 earlier of: (1) The actual filing date of the patent or the application for patent; or (2)
 if the patent or application for patent is entitled to claim the benefit of, or priority
 to, the filing date of an earlier U.S. provisional, U.S. nonprovisional, international
 (PCT), or foreign patent application, the filing date of the earliest such application that
 describes the subject matter of the claimed invention. Thus, a U.S. patent document is
 effective as prior art as of the filing date of the earliest application to which benefit
 or priority is claimed and which describes the subject matter relied upon, regardless of
 whether the earliest such application is a U.S. provisional or nonprovisional application,
 an international (PCT) application, or a foreign patent application.
 


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1a7)** and **[(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** provide that a disclosure shall not
 be prior art to a claimed invention under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if: (1) The subject
 matter disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor;
 or (2) the subject matter disclosed had, before such subject matter was effectively filed
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor or another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from
 the inventor or a joint inventor. Thus, under the AIA, a U.S. patent document that was not
 issued or published more than one year before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention is not prior art to the claimed invention if: (1) The U.S. patent document was by
 another who obtained the subject matter disclosed from the inventor or a joint inventor; or
 (2) the inventor or a joint inventor, or another who obtained the subject matter disclosed
 from an inventor or joint inventor, had publicly disclosed the subject matter before the
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** ("effectively filed") date of the U.S. patent document. 
 


Additionally, **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** provides
 that a disclosure made in a U.S. patent document shall not be prior art to a claimed
 invention under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if, not later than the effective filing date of
 the claimed invention, the subject matter disclosed and the claimed invention were owned by
 the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person. This
 provision replaces the exception in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** that applied
 only in the context of an obviousness analysis under **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** to prior art that was commonly owned at the time the claimed
 invention was made, and which qualified as prior art only under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, **[(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)**, and/or **[(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**. Thus, the AIA
 provides that certain prior patents and published patent applications of co-workers and
 collaborators are not prior art either for purposes of determining novelty
 (**[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**) or nonobviousness (**[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**). This exception,
 however, only removes disclosures as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, namely, U.S. patent documents that were not published, but
 that were effectively filed, before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.
 This exception is not effective to except prior art that is also available under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, that is, patents, printed publications, public uses, sale
 activities, or other publicly available disclosures published or occurring before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention. A prior disclosure, as defined in
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, by a co-worker or collaborator is prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** unless it falls within an exception under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**, regardless of whether the subject matter of the
 prior disclosure and the claimed invention was commonly owned not later than the effective
 filing date of the claimed invention.
 


The AIA eliminates the provisions in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302399)** (abandonment of the invention), **[102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302403)** (premature
 foreign patenting), **[102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** (derivation), and **[102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** (prior invention by another, but
 see below for discussion of continued limited applicability). Under the AIA, abandonment of
 the invention or premature foreign patenting is not relevant to patentability. Prior
 invention by another is likewise not relevant to patentability under the AIA unless there
 is a prior disclosure or filing of an application by another. A situation in which an
 application names a person who is not the actual inventor as the inventor
 (**[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)**) will be handled in a derivation proceeding under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 135](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19834_19b)**, by a correction of inventorship under **[37 CFR 1.48](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317930)** to name
 the actual inventor, or through a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 115](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302875912)**. See
 **[MPEP ยง
 2157](s2157.html#ch2100_d20034_1bb92_e7)**.
 


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)** provides for common ownership of subject matter made pursuant
 to joint research agreements. Under **[35 U.S.C. 100(h)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e10_359)**, the term "joint
 research agreement" as used in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)** is defined as a
 written contract, grant, or cooperative agreement entered into by two or more persons or
 entities for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work in the field
 of the claimed invention. **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)** specifically
 provides that subject matter disclosed and a claimed invention shall be deemed to have been
 owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person in
 applying the provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** if: (1) The
 subject matter disclosed was developed and the claimed invention was made by, or on behalf
 of, one or more parties to a joint research agreement that was in effect on or before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention; (2) the claimed invention was made as a
 result of activities undertaken within the scope of the joint research agreement; and (3)
 the application for patent for the claimed invention discloses or is amended to disclose
 the names of the parties to the joint research agreement.
 


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** provides that a patent for a claimed invention may not be
 obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed as set
 forth in **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, if the differences between the claimed invention and the
 prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art
 to which the claimed invention pertains. In addition, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** provides that patentability shall not be negated by the manner in
 which the invention was made. This provision tracks **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**, except that
 the temporal focus for the obviousness inquiry is before the effective filing date of the
 claimed invention, rather than at the time of the invention. The provisions of
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** have been replaced with **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** and **[(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)**, and the provisions of
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302462)** pertaining to biotechnological processes have been
 eliminated.
 


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** took effect on March 16, 2013.
 These new provisions apply to any patent application that contains or contained at any
 time: (1) a claim to a claimed invention that has an effective filing date as defined in
 **[35 U.S.C.
 100(i)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)** that is on or after March 16, 2013; or (2) a designation as a
 continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part of an application that contains or
 contained at any time a claim to a claimed invention that has an effective filing date that
 is on or after March 16, 2013. Such an application is referred to as an AIA (first inventor
 to file) application (hereinafter "AIA application"). **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** also apply to any patent resulting
 from an AIA application. See Public Law 112-29, ยง 3(n)(1), 125 Stat. at 293. See also
 **[MPEP ยง
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)***et seq.* for guidance in determining whether an application is subject to
 **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**.
 


The AIA provides that the provisions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** apply to each claim of an AIA application for patent if the
