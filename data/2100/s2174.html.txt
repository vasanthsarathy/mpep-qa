# 2174 Relationship Between the Requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112(a) and (b)
 or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, First and Second Paragraphs [R-11.2013]


The requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or the
 first and second paragraphs of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** are separate and
 distinct. If a description or the enabling disclosure of a specification is not
 commensurate in scope with the subject matter encompassed by a claim, that fact alone does
 not render the claim imprecise or indefinite or otherwise not in compliance with
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph; rather, the claim is based on an insufficient disclosure (**[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph)
 and should be rejected on that ground. *In re**Borkowski,* 422 F.2d 904, 164 USPQ 642 (CCPA 1970). If the specification
 discloses that a particular feature or element is critical or essential to the practice of
 the invention, failure to recite or include that particular feature or element in the
 claims may provide a basis for a rejection based on the ground that those claims are not
 supported by an enabling disclosure. *In re Mayhew,* 527 F.2d 1229, 188
 USPQ 356 (CCPA 1976). In *Mayhew,* the examiner argued that the only mode
 of operation of the process disclosed in the specification involved the use of a cooling
 zone at a particular location in the processing cycle. The claims were rejected because
 they failed to specify either a cooling step or the location of the step in the process.
 The court was convinced that the cooling bath and its location were essential, and held
 that claims which failed to recite the use of a cooling zone, specifically located, were
 not supported by an enabling disclosure (**[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph).
 


In addition, if a claim is amended to include an invention that is not
 described in the application as filed, a rejection of that claim under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph,
 as being directed to subject matter that is not described in the specification as filed may
 be appropriate.  *In re**Simon,* 302 F.2d 737, 133 USPQ 524 (CCPA 1962). In
 *Simon,* which involved a reissue application containing claims to a
 reaction product of a composition, applicant presented claims to a reaction product of a
 composition comprising the subcombination A+B+C, whereas the original claims and
 description of the invention were directed to a composition comprising the combination
 A+B+C+D+E. The court found no significant support for the argument that ingredients D+E
 were not essential to the claimed reaction product and concluded that claims directed to
 the reaction product of a subcombination A+B+C were not described (**[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph) in the application as filed. See also *In re**Panagrossi,* 277 F.2d 181, 125 USPQ 410 (CCPA 1960).
