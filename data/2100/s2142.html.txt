# 2142 Legal Concept of *Prima Facie* Obviousness [R-10.2019]


"During patent examination and reexamination, the concept of
 prima facie obviousness establishes the framework for the obviousness determination and the
 burdens the parties face. Under this framework, the patent examiner must first set forth a
 prima facie case, supported by evidence, showing why the claims at issue would have been
 obvious in light of the prior art. Once the examiner sets out this prima facie case, the
 burden shifts to the patentee to provide evidence, in the prior art or beyond it, or
 argument sufficient to rebut the examiner's evidence. The examiner then reaches the final
 determination on obviousness by weighing the evidence establishing the prima facie case
 with the rebuttal evidence." ACCO Brands Corp. v. Fellowes, Inc., 813 F.3d 1361, 1365–66,
 117 USPQ2d 1951, 1553-54 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (internal citations omitted). 
 


The legal concept of *prima facie* obviousness is a
 procedural tool of examination which applies broadly to all arts. It allocates who has the
 burden of going forward with production of evidence in each step of the examination
 process. See *In re Rinehart,* 531 F.2d 1048, 189 USPQ 143 (CCPA 1976);
 *In re Lintner,* 458 F.2d 1013, 173 USPQ 560 (CCPA 1972); *In
 re Saunders,* 444 F.2d 599, 170 USPQ 213 (CCPA 1971); *In re
 Tiffin,* 443 F.2d 394, 170 USPQ 88 (CCPA 1971), *amended,* 448
 F.2d 791, 171 USPQ 294 (CCPA 1971); *In re Warner,* 379 F.2d 1011, 154
 USPQ 173 (CCPA 1967), *cert. denied,* 389 U.S. 1057 (1968). The examiner
 bears the initial burden of factually supporting any *prima facie*
 conclusion of obviousness. If the examiner does not produce a *prima
 facie* case, the applicant is under no obligation to submit secondary evidence
 to show nonobviousness. If, however, the examiner does produce a *prima
 facie* case, the burden of coming forward with evidence or arguments shifts to
 the applicant who may submit additional evidence of nonobviousness, such as comparative
 test data showing that the claimed invention possesses improved properties not expected by
 the prior art. The decision of whether to submit evidence after a rejection should be
 influenced by the goals of compact prosecution, which encourages the early submission of
 such evidence. It is also noted that evidence submitted after final rejection may be denied
 entry into the record.
 


To reach a proper determination under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the examiner must step
 backward in time and into the shoes worn by the hypothetical "person of ordinary skill in
 the art" when the invention was unknown and just before it was made. In view of all factual
 information, the examiner must then make a determination whether the claimed invention "as
 a whole" would have been obvious at that time to a hypothetical person of ordinary skill in
 the art. Knowledge of applicant’s disclosure must be put aside in reaching this
 determination, yet kept in mind in order to determine the "differences," conduct the search
 and evaluate the "subject matter as a whole" of the invention. The tendency to resort to
 "hindsight" based upon applicant's disclosure is often difficult to avoid due to the very
 nature of the examination process. However, impermissible hindsight must be avoided and the
 legal conclusion must be reached on the basis of the facts gleaned from the prior art. 
 


**[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** authorizes a rejection where, to meet the claim, it is necessary
 to modify a single reference or to combine it with one or more other references. After
 indicating that the rejection is under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the examiner should set
 forth in the Office action:
 


* (A) the relevant teachings of the prior art relied upon, preferably with
 reference to the relevant column or page number(s) and line number(s) where
 appropriate,
* (B) the difference or differences in the claim over the applied
 reference(s),
* (C) the proposed modification of the applied reference(s) necessary to
 arrive at the claimed subject matter, and
* (D) an explanation as to why the claimed invention would have been
 obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.


"To support the conclusion that the claimed invention is directed to
 obvious subject matter, either the references must expressly or impliedly suggest the
 claimed invention or the examiner must present a convincing line of reasoning as to why the
 artisan would have found the claimed invention to have been obvious in light of the
 teachings of the references." *Ex parte Clapp,* 227 USPQ 972, 973 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1985). 
 


Where a reference is relied on to support a rejection, whether or not in a
 minor capacity, that reference should be positively included in the statement of the
 rejection. See *In re Hoch,* 428 F.2d 1341, 1342 n.3 166 USPQ 406, 407 n.
 3 (CCPA 1970).
 


It is important for an examiner to properly communicate the basis for a
 rejection so that the issues can be identified early and the applicant can be given fair
 opportunity to reply. Furthermore, if an initially rejected application issues as a patent,
 the rationale behind an earlier rejection may be important in interpreting the scope of the
 patent claims. Since issued patents are presumed valid (**[35 U.S.C. 282](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845)**) and constitute a
 property right (**[35 U.S.C.
 261](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305441)**), the written record must be clear as to the basis for the grant.
 Since patent examiners cannot normally be compelled to testify in legal proceedings
 regarding their mental processes (see **[MPEP § 1701.01](s1701.html#d0e162459)**), it is important that the
 written record clearly explain the rationale for decisions made during prosecution of the
 application.

 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.
 

**ESTABLISHING A *PRIMA FACIE* CASE OF OBVIOUSNESS**The key to supporting any rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is
 the clear articulation of the reason(s) why the claimed invention would have been
 obvious. The Supreme Court in *KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,* 550
 U.S. 398, 418, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1396 (2007) noted that the analysis supporting a
 rejection under **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be made explicit. The Federal Circuit has stated
 that "rejections on obviousness cannot be sustained with mere conclusory statements;
 instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to
 support the legal conclusion of obviousness." *In re Kahn,* 441 F.3d
 977, 988, 78 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also *KSR,* 550
 U.S. at 418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396 (quoting Federal Circuit statement with approval). 
 


It remains true that "[t]he determination of obviousness is dependent
 on the facts of each case." *Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc.,* 550
 F.3d 1075, 1089, 89 USPQ2d 1370, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citing
 *Graham,* 383 U.S. at 17-18, 148 USPQ 459, 467 (1966)). If the
 examiner determines there is factual support for rejecting the claimed invention under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the examiner must then consider any evidence supporting the
 patentability of the claimed invention, such as any evidence in the specification or any
 other evidence submitted by the applicant. The ultimate determination of patentability
 is based on the entire record, by a preponderance of evidence, with due consideration to
 the persuasiveness of any arguments and any secondary evidence. *In re
 Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The legal standard
 of "a preponderance of evidence" requires the evidence to be more convincing than the
 evidence which is offered in opposition to it. With regard to rejections under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the examiner must provide evidence which as a whole shows
 that the legal determination sought to be proved (i.e., the reference teachings
 establish a *prima facie* case of obviousness) is more probable than
 not.
 


When an applicant properly submits evidence, whether in the
 specification as originally filed, prior to a rejection, or in reply to a rejection, the
 examiner must consider the patentability of the claims in light of the evidence. The
 decision on patentability must be made based upon consideration of all the evidence,
 including the evidence submitted by the examiner and the evidence submitted by the
 applicant. A decision to make or maintain a rejection in the face of all the evidence
 must show that it was based on the totality of the evidence. Facts established by
 rebuttal evidence must be evaluated along with the facts on which the conclusion of
 obviousness was reached, not against the conclusion itself. *In re Eli Lilly
 & Co.,* 902 F.2d 943, 14 USPQ2d 1741 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
 


See *In re Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 223 USPQ 785
 (Fed. Cir. 1984) for a discussion of the proper roles of the examiner’s *prima
 facie* case and applicant’s rebuttal evidence in the final determination of
 obviousness.
