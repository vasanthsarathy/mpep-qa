# 2112 Requirements of Rejection Based on Inherency; Burden of Proof [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications subject
 to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the relevant date
 is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the "time of the
 invention," which is only applicable to applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*


The express, implicit, and inherent disclosures of a prior art reference
 may be relied upon in the rejection of claims under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. "The inherent
 teaching of a prior art reference, a question of fact, arises both in the context of
 anticipation and obviousness." *In re Napier,* 55 F.3d 610, 613, 34 USPQ2d
 1782, 1784 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (affirmed a **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** rejection based in part
 on inherent disclosure in one of the references). See also *In re
 Grasselli,* 713 F.2d 731, 739, 218 USPQ 769, 775 (Fed. Cir. 1983).
 

**I.** **SOMETHING WHICH IS OLD DOES NOT BECOME PATENTABLE UPON THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW
 PROPERTY**"[T]he discovery of a previously unappreciated property of a prior art
 composition, or of a scientific explanation for the prior art’s functioning, does not
 render the old composition patentably new to the discoverer." *Atlas Powder Co.
 v. IRECO Inc.,* 190 F.3d 1342, 1347, 51 USPQ2d 1943, 1947 (Fed. Cir. 1999).
 Thus the claiming of a new use, new function or unknown property which is inherently
 present in the prior art does not necessarily make the claim patentable. *In re
 Best,* 562 F.2d 1252, 1254, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977). In *In re
 Crish,* 393 F.3d 1253, 1258, 73 USPQ2d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the
 court held that the claimed promoter sequence obtained by sequencing a prior art plasmid
 that was not previously sequenced was anticipated by the prior art plasmid which
 necessarily possessed the same DNA sequence as the claimed oligonucleotides*.* The court stated that "just as the discovery of properties of a known material
 does not make it novel, the identification and characterization of a prior art material
 also does not make it novel." *Id.* See also **[MPEP § 2112.01](s2112.html#d0e201273)** with
 regard to inherency and product-by-process claims and **[MPEP § 2141.02](s2141.html#d0e209106)** with
 regard to inherency and rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.
 

**II.** **INHERENT FEATURE NEED NOT BE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF THE INVENTION**There is no requirement that a person of ordinary skill in the art
 would have recognized the inherent disclosure *at the time of
 invention,* but only that the subject matter is in fact inherent in the
 prior art reference. *Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharm. Inc.,* 339 F.3d
 1373, 1377, 67 USPQ2d 1664, 1668 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (rejecting the contention that
 inherent anticipation requires recognition by a person of ordinary skill in the art
 before the critical date and allowing expert testimony with respect to post-critical
 date clinical trials to show inherency); see also *Toro Co. v. Deere &
 Co.,* 355 F.3d 1313, 1320, 69 USPQ2d 1584, 1590 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("[T]he
 fact that a characteristic is a necessary feature or result of a prior-art embodiment
 (that is itself sufficiently described and enabled) is enough for inherent anticipation,
 even if that fact was unknown at the time of the prior invention."); *Abbott
 Labs v. Geneva Pharms., Inc.,* 182 F.3d 1315, 1319, 51 USPQ2d 1307, 1310
 (Fed.Cir.1999) ("If a product that is offered for sale inherently possesses each of the
 limitations of the claims, then the invention is on sale, whether or not the parties to
 the transaction recognize that the product possesses the claimed
 characteristics."); *Atlas Powder Co. v. IRECO, Inc.,* 190 F.3d
 1342, 1348-49, 51 USPQ2d 1943, 1947 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("Because ‘sufficient aeration’ was
 inherent in the prior art, it is irrelevant that the prior art did not recognize the key
 aspect of [the] invention.... An inherent structure, composition, or function is not
 necessarily known."); *SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp.,* 403
 F.3d 1331, 1343-44, 74 USPQ2d 1398, 1406-07 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (holding that a prior art
 patent to an anhydrous form of a compound "inherently" anticipated the claimed
 hemihydrate form of the compound because practicing the process in the prior art to
 manufacture the anhydrous compound "inherently results in at least trace amounts of" the
 claimed hemihydrate even if the prior art did not discuss or recognize the hemihydrate);
 *In re Omeprazole Patent Litigation,* 483 F.3d 1364, 1373, 82 USPQ2d
 1643, 1650 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (The court noted that although the inventors may not have
 recognized that a characteristic of the ingredients in the prior art method resulted in
 an in situ formation of a separating layer, the *in situ* formation was
 nevertheless inherent. "The record shows formation of the *in situ*
 separating layer in the prior art even though that process was not recognized at the
 time. The new realization alone does not render that necessary [sic] prior art
 patentable.").
 

**III.** **A REJECTION UNDER 35 U.S.C. 102 AND 103 CAN BE MADE WHEN THE PRIOR ART PRODUCT
 SEEMS TO BE IDENTICAL EXCEPT THAT THE PRIOR ART IS SILENT AS TO AN INHERENT
 CHARACTERISTIC**Where applicant claims a composition in terms of a function, property
 or characteristic and the composition of the prior art is the same as that of the claim
 but the function is not explicitly disclosed by the reference, the examiner may make a
 rejection under both **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. "There is nothing inconsistent
 in concurrent rejections for obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** and for anticipation
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**." *In re Best,* 562 F.2d 1252, 1255 n.4, 195
 USPQ 430, 433 n.4 (CCPA 1977). This same rationale should also apply to product,
 apparatus, and process claims claimed in terms of function, property or characteristic.
 Therefore, a **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** rejection is appropriate for
 these types of claims as well as for composition claims. 
 

**IV.** **EXAMINER MUST PROVIDE RATIONALE OR EVIDENCE TO SHOW INHERENCY**The fact that a certain result or characteristic
 may occur or be present in the prior art is not sufficient to
 establish the inherency of that result or characteristic. *In re
 Rijckaert,* 9 F.3d 1531, 1534, 28 USPQ2d 1955, 1957 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 (reversed rejection because inherency was based on what would result due to optimization
 of conditions, not what was necessarily present in the prior art); *In re
 Oelrich,* 666 F.2d 578, 581-82, 212 USPQ 323, 326 (CCPA 1981). Also, "[a]n
 invitation to investigate is not an inherent disclosure" where a prior art reference
 "discloses no more than a broad genus of potential applications of its discoveries."
 *Metabolite Labs., Inc. v. Lab.**Corp. of Am. Holdings,* 370 F.3d 1354, 1367, 71 USPQ2d 1081,
 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (explaining that "[a] prior art reference that discloses a genus
 still does not inherently disclose all species within that broad category" but must be
 examined to see if a disclosure of the claimed species has been made or whether the
 prior art reference merely invites further experimentation to find the species).
 


"In relying upon the theory of inherency, the examiner must provide a
 basis in fact and/or technical reasoning to reasonably support the determination that
 the allegedly inherent characteristic necessarily flows from the
 teachings of the applied prior art." *Ex parte Levy,* 17 USPQ2d 1461,
 1464 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990) (emphasis in original) (Applicant’s invention was
 directed to a biaxially oriented, flexible dilation catheter balloon (a tube which
 expands upon inflation) used, for example, in clearing the blood vessels of heart
 patients). The examiner applied a U.S. patent to Schjeldahl which disclosed injection
 molding a tubular preform and then injecting air into the preform to expand it against a
 mold (blow molding). The reference did not directly state that the end product balloon
 was biaxially oriented. It did disclose that the balloon was
 "formed from a thin flexible inelastic, high tensile strength, biaxially oriented
 synthetic plastic material." *Id.* at 1462 (emphasis in original). The
 examiner argued that Schjeldahl’s balloon was inherently biaxially oriented. The Board
 reversed on the basis that the examiner did not provide objective evidence or cogent
 technical reasoning to support the conclusion of inherency.).
 


In *In re Schreiber,* 128 F.3d 1473, 44 USPQ2d 1429
 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the court affirmed a finding that a prior patent to a conical spout
 used primarily to dispense oil from an oil can inherently performed the functions
 recited in applicant’s claim to a conical container top for dispensing popped popcorn.
 The examiner had asserted inherency based on the structural similarity between the
 patented spout and applicant’s disclosed top, i.e., both structures had the same general
 shape. The court stated:
 



> 
> [N]othing in Schreiber’s [applicant’s] claim suggests that
>  Schreiber’s container is 'of a different shape’ than Harz’s [patent]. In fact, [ ] an
>  embodiment according to Harz (Fig. 5) and the embodiment depicted in figure 1 of
>  Schreiber’s application have the same general shape. For that reason, the examiner
>  was justified in concluding that the opening of a conically shaped top as disclosed
>  by Harz is inherently of a size sufficient to ‘allow [ ] several kernels of popped
>  popcorn to pass through at the same time’ and that the taper of Harz’s conically
>  shaped top is inherently of such a shape ‘as to by itself jam up the popped popcorn
>  before the end of the cone and permit the dispensing of only a few kernels at a shake
>  of a package when the top is mounted to the container.’ The examiner therefore
>  correctly found that Harz established a prima facie case of anticipation.
>  
> 
> 
> 


*Schreiber,* 128 F.3d at 1478, 44 USPQ2d at 1432.
 

**V.** **ONCE A REFERENCE TEACHING PRODUCT APPEARING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL IS MADE
 THE BASIS OF A REJECTION, AND THE EXAMINER PRESENTS EVIDENCE OR REASONING TO SHOW
 INHERENCY, THE BURDEN OF PRODUCTION SHIFTS TO THE APPLICANT**"[T]he PTO can require an applicant to prove that the prior art
 products do not necessarily or inherently possess the characteristics of his [or her]
 claimed product. Whether the rejection is based on ‘inherency’ under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, on
 ‘*prima facie* obviousness’ under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**,
 jointly or alternatively, the burden of proof is the same." *In re Best,* 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433-34 (CCPA 1977) (footnote and citation
 omitted). The burden of proof is similar to that required with respect to
 product-by-process claims. *In re Fitzgerald,* 619 F.2d 67, 70, 205
 USPQ 594, 596 (CCPA 1980) (citing *Best,* 562 F.2d at 1255).
 


In *Fitzgerald,* the claims were directed to a
 self-locking screw-threaded fastener comprising a metallic threaded fastener having
 patches of crystallizable thermoplastic bonded thereto. The claim further specified that
 the thermoplastic had a reduced degree of crystallization shrinkage. The specification
 disclosed that the locking fastener was made by heating the metal fastener to melt a
 thermoplastic blank which is pressed against the metal. After the thermoplastic adheres
 to the metal fastener, the end product is cooled by quenching in water. The examiner
 made a rejection based on a U.S. patent to Barnes. Barnes taught a self-locking fastener
 in which the patch of thermoplastic was made by depositing thermoplastic powder on a
 metallic fastener which was then heated. The end product was cooled in ambient air, by
 cooling air or by contacting the fastener with a water trough. The court first noted
 that the two fasteners were identical or only slightly different from each other. "Both
 fasteners possess the same utility, employ the same crystallizable polymer (nylon 11),
 and have an adherent plastic patch formed by melting and then cooling the polymer."
 *Id.* at 596 n.1, 619 F.2d at 70 n.1. The court then noted that the
 Board had found that Barnes’ cooling rate could reasonably be expected to result in a
 polymer possessing the claimed crystallization shrinkage rate. Applicants had not
 rebutted this finding with evidence that the shrinkage rate was indeed different. They
 had only argued that the crystallization shrinkage rate was dependent on the cool down
 rate and that the cool down rate of Barnes was much slower than theirs. Because a
 difference in the cool down rate does not necessarily result in a difference in
 shrinkage, objective evidence was required to rebut the **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**/**[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)***prima facie* case.
 


In *Schreiber,* 128 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429,
 1432 (Fed.Cir.1997), the court held that applicant’s declaration failed to overcome a
 *prima facie* case of anticipation because the declaration did not
 specify the dimensions of either the dispensing top that was tested or the popcorn that
 was used. Applicant’s declaration merely asserted that a conical dispensing top built
 according to a figure in the prior art patent was too small to jam and dispense popcorn
 and thus could not inherently perform the functions recited in applicant’s claims. The
 court pointed out the disclosure of the prior art patent was not limited to use as an
 oil can dispenser, but rather was broader than the precise configuration shown in the
 patent’s figure. The court also noted that the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences
 found as a factual matter that a scaled-up version of the top disclosed in the patent
 would be capable of performing the functions recited in applicant’s claim.
 


See **[MPEP
 § 2113](s2113.html#d0e201450)** for more information on the analogous burden of proof
 applied to product-by-process claims.
 



# 2112.01 Composition, Product, and  Apparatus Claims [R-10.2019]

**I.** **PRODUCT AND APPARATUS CLAIMS — WHEN THE STRUCTURE RECITED IN THE REFERENCE IS
 SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE CLAIMS, CLAIMED PROPERTIES OR FUNCTIONS ARE
 PRESUMED TO BE INHERENT**Where the claimed and prior art products are identical or
 substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or
 substantially identical processes, a *prima facie* case of either
 anticipation or obviousness has been established. *In re Best,* 562
 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977). "When the PTO shows a sound basis for
 believing that the products of the applicant and the prior art are the same, the
 applicant has the burden of showing that they are not." *In re
 Spada,* 911 F.2d 705, 709, 15 USPQ2d 1655, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
 Therefore, the *prima facie* case can be rebutted by evidence
 showing that the prior art products do not necessarily possess
 the characteristics of the claimed product. *In re Best,* 562 F.2d
 at 1255, 195 USPQ at 433. See also *Titanium Metals Corp.**v. Banner,* 778 F.2d 775, 227 USPQ 773 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Claims
 were directed to a titanium alloy containing 0.2-0.4% Mo and 0.6-0.9% Ni having
 corrosion resistance. A Russian article disclosed a titanium alloy containing 0.25%
 Mo and 0.75% Ni but was silent as to corrosion resistance. The Federal Circuit held
 that the claim was anticipated because the percentages of Mo and Ni were squarely
 within the claimed ranges. The court went on to say that it was immaterial what
 properties the alloys had or who discovered the properties because the composition is
 the same and thus must necessarily exhibit the properties.).
 


See also *In re Ludtke,* 441 F.2d 660, 169 USPQ 563
 (CCPA 1971) (Claim 1 was directed to a parachute canopy having concentric
 circumferential panels radially separated from each other by radially extending tie
 lines. The panels were separated "such that the critical velocity of each
 successively larger panel will be less than the critical velocity of the previous
 panel, whereby said parachute will sequentially open and thus gradually decelerate."
 The court found that the claim was anticipated by Menget. Menget taught a parachute
 having three circumferential panels separated by tie lines. The court upheld the
 rejection finding that applicant had failed to show that Menget did not possess the
 functional characteristics of the claims.); *Northam Warren Corp.**v.**D. F. Newfield Co.,* 7 F.Supp. 773, 22 USPQ 313 (E.D.N.Y. 1934) (A
 patent to a pencil for cleaning fingernails was held invalid because a pencil of the
 same structure for writing was found in the prior art.).
 

**II.** **COMPOSITION CLAIMS — IF THE COMPOSITION IS PHYSICALLY THE SAME, IT MUST HAVE
 THE SAME PROPERTIES**"Products of identical chemical composition can not have mutually
 exclusive properties." *In re Spada,* 911 F.2d 705, 709, 15 USPQ2d
 1655, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 1990). A chemical composition and its properties are
 inseparable. Therefore, if the prior art teaches the identical chemical structure,
 the properties applicant discloses and/or claims are necessarily present.
 *Id.* (Applicant argued that the claimed composition was a
 pressure sensitive adhesive containing a tacky polymer while the product of the
 reference was hard and abrasion resistant. "The Board correctly found that the
 virtual identity of monomers and procedures sufficed to support a *prima
 facie* case of unpatentability of Spada’s polymer latexes for lack of
 novelty.").
 

**III.** **PRODUCT CLAIMS – NONFUNCTIONAL PRINTED MATTER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH CLAIMED
 PRODUCT FROM OTHERWISE IDENTICAL PRIOR ART PRODUCT**Where the only difference between a prior art product and a claimed
 product is printed matter that is not functionally related to the product, the
 content of the printed matter will not distinguish the claimed product from the prior
 art. *In re Ngai,* 367 F.3d 1336, 1339, 70 USPQ2d 1862, 1864 (Fed.
 Cir. 2004) (Claim at issue was a kit requiring instructions and a buffer agent. The
 Federal Circuit held that the claim was anticipated by a prior art reference that
 taught a kit that included instructions and a buffer agent, even though the content
 of the instructions differed, explaining "[i]f we were to adopt [applicant’s]
 position, anyone could continue patenting a product indefinitely provided that they
 add a new instruction sheet to the product."). See also *In re
 Gulack,* 703 F.2d 1381, 1385-86, 217 USPQ 401, 404 (Fed. Cir. 1983)
 (
 "Where the printed matter is not functionally
 related to the substrate, the printed matter will not distinguish the invention
 from the prior art in terms of patentability….[T]he critical question is whether
 there exists any new and unobvious functional relationship between the printed
 matter and the substrate."
 
 
 ); *In re Miller,*
 418 F.2d 1392, 1396 (CCPA 1969) (finding a new and nonobvious relationship between a
 measuring cup and writing showing how to "half" a recipe); *In re
 Seid,* 161 F.2d 229, 73 USPQ 431 (CCPA 1947) (matters relating to
 ornamentation only which have no mechanical function cannot be relied upon to
 patentably distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art); *In re
 Xiao,* 462 Fed. App'x 947, 950-51 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (non-precedential)
 (affirming an obviousness rejection of claims directed to a tumbler lock that used
 letters instead of numbers and had a wild-card label instead of one of the letters);
 *In re Bryan,* 323 Fed. App'x 898, 901 (Fed. Cir. 2009)
 (non-precedential) (printed matter on game cards bears no new and nonobvious
 functional relationship to game board). 
 


The court has extended the rationale in the printed
 matter cases, in which, for example, written instructions are added to a known
 product, to method claims in which "an instruction limitation" (i.e., a limitation
 "informing" someone about the existence of an inherent property of that method) is
 added to a method known in the art. *King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eon
 Labs,* Inc., 616 F.3d 1267, 1279, 95 USPQ2d 1833, 1842 (2010). Similar to
 the inquiry for products with printed matter thereon, for such method cases the
 relevant inquiry is whether a new and nonobvious functional relationship with the
 known method exists. In *King Pharma,* the court found that the
 relevant determination is whether the "instruction limitation" has a "new and
 unobvious functional relationship" with the known method of administering the drug
 with food. *Id.*. The court held that the relationship was
 non-functional because "[i]nforming a patient about the benefits of a drug in no way
 transforms the process of taking the drug with food." *Id.* That is,
 the actual method of taking a drug with food is the same regardless of whether the
 patient is informed of the benefits. *Id.* "In other words, the
 ‘informing’ limitation ‘in no way depends on the method, and the method does not
 depend on the ‘informing’ limitation.’" *Id.* (citing *In re
 Ngai,* 367 F.3d 1336, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); see also *In re
 Kao,* 639 F.3d 1057, 1072-73, 98 USPQ2d 1799, 1811-12 (Fed. Cir.
 2011).
 




# 2112.02 Process Claims [R-10.2019]

**I.** **PROCESS CLAIMS — PRIOR ART DEVICE ANTICIPATES A CLAIMED PROCESS IF THE DEVICE
 CARRIES OUT THE PROCESS DURING NORMAL OPERATION**Under the principles of inherency, if a prior art device, in its
 normal and usual operation, would necessarily perform the method claimed, then the
 method claimed will be considered to be anticipated by the prior art device. When the
 prior art device is the same as a device described in the specification for carrying
 out the claimed method, it can be assumed the device will inherently perform the
 claimed process. *In re King,* 801 F.2d 1324, 231 USPQ 136 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986) (The claims were directed to a method of enhancing color effects produced
 by ambient light through a process of absorption and reflection of the light off a
 coated substrate. A prior art reference to *Donley* disclosed a
 glass substrate coated with silver and metal oxide 200-800 angstroms thick. While
 Donley disclosed using the coated substrate to produce architectural colors, the
 absorption and reflection mechanisms of the claimed process were not disclosed.
 However, King’s specification disclosed using a coated substrate of Donley’s
 structure for use in his process. The Federal Circuit upheld the Board’s finding that
 
 "Donley inherently performs the function
 disclosed in the method claims on appeal when that device is used in ‘normal and
 usual operation’"
 
 
 and found that a *prima
 facie* case of anticipation was made out. *Id.* at 138,
 801 F.2d at 1326. It was up to applicant to prove that Donley's structure would not
 perform the claimed method when placed in ambient light.). See also *In re
 Best,* 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977) (Applicant
 claimed a process for preparing a hydrolytically-stable zeolitic aluminosilicate
 which included a step of "cooling the steam zeolite ... at a rate sufficiently rapid
 that the cooled zeolite exhibits an X-ray diffraction pattern ...." All the process
 limitations were expressly disclosed by a U.S. patent to Hansford except the cooling
 step. The court stated that any sample of Hansford’s zeolite would necessarily be
 cooled to facilitate subsequent handling. Therefore, rejections under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** were properly made. Applicant
 had failed to introduce any evidence comparing X-ray diffraction patterns showing a
 difference in cooling rate between the claimed process and that of Hansford or any
 data showing that the process of Hansford would result in a product with a different
 X-ray diffraction. Either type of evidence would have rebutted the rejections under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. A further analysis would be necessary to determine if the
 process was nonobvious under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.); *Ex
 parte**Novitski,* 26 USPQ2d 1389 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993) (The
 Board rejected a claim directed to a method for protecting a plant from plant
 pathogenic nematodes by inoculating the plant with a nematode inhibiting strain of
 *P. cepacia.* A U.S. patent to *Dart* disclosed
 inoculation using *P. cepacia* type Wisconsin 526 bacteria for
 protecting the plant from fungal disease. Dart was silent as to nematode inhibition
 but the Board concluded that nematode inhibition was an inherent property of the
 bacteria. The Board noted that applicant had stated in the specification that
 Wisconsin 526 possesses an 18% nematode inhibition rating.). 
 

**II.** **PROCESS OF USE CLAIMS — NEW AND NONOBVIOUS USES OF OLD STRUCTURES AND
 COMPOSITIONS MAY BE PATENTABLE**The discovery of a new use for an old structure based on unknown
 properties of the structure might be patentable to the discoverer as a process of
 using. *In re Hack,* 245 F.2d 246, 248, 114 USPQ 161, 163 (CCPA
 1957). However, when the claim recites using an old composition or structure and the
 "use" is directed to a result or property of that composition or structure, then the
 claim is anticipated. *In re**May,* 574 F.2d 1082, 1090, 197 USPQ 601, 607 (CCPA 1978) (Claims 1
 and 6, directed to a method of effecting nonaddictive analgesia (pain reduction) in
 animals, were found to be anticipated by the applied prior art which disclosed the
 same compounds for effecting analgesia but which was silent as to addiction. The
 court upheld the rejection and stated that the applicants had merely found a new
 property of the compound and such a discovery did not constitute a new use. The court
 went on to reverse the obviousness rejection of claims 2-5 and 7-10 which recited a
 process of using a new compound. The court relied on evidence showing that the
 nonaddictive property of the new compound was unexpected.). See also  *In re
 Tomlinson,* 363 F.2d 928, 150 USPQ 623 (CCPA 1966) (The claim was
 directed to a process of inhibiting light degradation of polypropylene by mixing it
 with one of a genus of compounds, including nickel dithiocarbamate. A reference
 taught mixing polypropylene with nickel dithiocarbamate to lower heat degradation.
 The court held that the claims read on the obvious process of mixing polypropylene
 with the nickel dithiocarbamate and that the preamble of the claim was merely
 directed to the result of mixing the two materials. "While the references do not show
 a specific recognition of that result, its discovery by appellants is tantamount only
 to finding a property in the old composition." 363 F.2d at
 934, 150 USPQ at 628 (emphasis in original)).

# 2112.01 Composition, Product, and  Apparatus Claims [R-10.2019]

**I.** **PRODUCT AND APPARATUS CLAIMS — WHEN THE STRUCTURE RECITED IN THE REFERENCE IS
 SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE CLAIMS, CLAIMED PROPERTIES OR FUNCTIONS ARE
 PRESUMED TO BE INHERENT**Where the claimed and prior art products are identical or
 substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or
 substantially identical processes, a *prima facie* case of either
 anticipation or obviousness has been established. *In re Best,* 562
 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977). "When the PTO shows a sound basis for
 believing that the products of the applicant and the prior art are the same, the
 applicant has the burden of showing that they are not." *In re
 Spada,* 911 F.2d 705, 709, 15 USPQ2d 1655, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
 Therefore, the *prima facie* case can be rebutted by evidence
 showing that the prior art products do not necessarily possess
 the characteristics of the claimed product. *In re Best,* 562 F.2d
 at 1255, 195 USPQ at 433. See also *Titanium Metals Corp.**v. Banner,* 778 F.2d 775, 227 USPQ 773 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Claims
 were directed to a titanium alloy containing 0.2-0.4% Mo and 0.6-0.9% Ni having
 corrosion resistance. A Russian article disclosed a titanium alloy containing 0.25%
 Mo and 0.75% Ni but was silent as to corrosion resistance. The Federal Circuit held
 that the claim was anticipated because the percentages of Mo and Ni were squarely
 within the claimed ranges. The court went on to say that it was immaterial what
 properties the alloys had or who discovered the properties because the composition is
 the same and thus must necessarily exhibit the properties.).
 


See also *In re Ludtke,* 441 F.2d 660, 169 USPQ 563
 (CCPA 1971) (Claim 1 was directed to a parachute canopy having concentric
 circumferential panels radially separated from each other by radially extending tie
 lines. The panels were separated "such that the critical velocity of each
 successively larger panel will be less than the critical velocity of the previous
 panel, whereby said parachute will sequentially open and thus gradually decelerate."
 The court found that the claim was anticipated by Menget. Menget taught a parachute
 having three circumferential panels separated by tie lines. The court upheld the
 rejection finding that applicant had failed to show that Menget did not possess the
 functional characteristics of the claims.); *Northam Warren Corp.**v.**D. F. Newfield Co.,* 7 F.Supp. 773, 22 USPQ 313 (E.D.N.Y. 1934) (A
 patent to a pencil for cleaning fingernails was held invalid because a pencil of the
 same structure for writing was found in the prior art.).
 

**II.** **COMPOSITION CLAIMS — IF THE COMPOSITION IS PHYSICALLY THE SAME, IT MUST HAVE
 THE SAME PROPERTIES**"Products of identical chemical composition can not have mutually
 exclusive properties." *In re Spada,* 911 F.2d 705, 709, 15 USPQ2d
 1655, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 1990). A chemical composition and its properties are
 inseparable. Therefore, if the prior art teaches the identical chemical structure,
 the properties applicant discloses and/or claims are necessarily present.
 *Id.* (Applicant argued that the claimed composition was a
 pressure sensitive adhesive containing a tacky polymer while the product of the
 reference was hard and abrasion resistant. "The Board correctly found that the
 virtual identity of monomers and procedures sufficed to support a *prima
 facie* case of unpatentability of Spada’s polymer latexes for lack of
 novelty.").
 

**III.** **PRODUCT CLAIMS – NONFUNCTIONAL PRINTED MATTER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH CLAIMED
 PRODUCT FROM OTHERWISE IDENTICAL PRIOR ART PRODUCT**Where the only difference between a prior art product and a claimed
 product is printed matter that is not functionally related to the product, the
 content of the printed matter will not distinguish the claimed product from the prior
 art. *In re Ngai,* 367 F.3d 1336, 1339, 70 USPQ2d 1862, 1864 (Fed.
 Cir. 2004) (Claim at issue was a kit requiring instructions and a buffer agent. The
 Federal Circuit held that the claim was anticipated by a prior art reference that
 taught a kit that included instructions and a buffer agent, even though the content
 of the instructions differed, explaining "[i]f we were to adopt [applicant’s]
 position, anyone could continue patenting a product indefinitely provided that they
 add a new instruction sheet to the product."). See also *In re
 Gulack,* 703 F.2d 1381, 1385-86, 217 USPQ 401, 404 (Fed. Cir. 1983)
 (
 "Where the printed matter is not functionally
 related to the substrate, the printed matter will not distinguish the invention
 from the prior art in terms of patentability….[T]he critical question is whether
 there exists any new and unobvious functional relationship between the printed
 matter and the substrate."
 
 
 ); *In re Miller,*
 418 F.2d 1392, 1396 (CCPA 1969) (finding a new and nonobvious relationship between a
 measuring cup and writing showing how to "half" a recipe); *In re
 Seid,* 161 F.2d 229, 73 USPQ 431 (CCPA 1947) (matters relating to
 ornamentation only which have no mechanical function cannot be relied upon to
 patentably distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art); *In re
 Xiao,* 462 Fed. App'x 947, 950-51 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (non-precedential)
 (affirming an obviousness rejection of claims directed to a tumbler lock that used
 letters instead of numbers and had a wild-card label instead of one of the letters);
 *In re Bryan,* 323 Fed. App'x 898, 901 (Fed. Cir. 2009)
 (non-precedential) (printed matter on game cards bears no new and nonobvious
 functional relationship to game board). 
 


The court has extended the rationale in the printed
 matter cases, in which, for example, written instructions are added to a known
 product, to method claims in which "an instruction limitation" (i.e., a limitation
 "informing" someone about the existence of an inherent property of that method) is
 added to a method known in the art. *King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eon
 Labs,* Inc., 616 F.3d 1267, 1279, 95 USPQ2d 1833, 1842 (2010). Similar to
 the inquiry for products with printed matter thereon, for such method cases the
 relevant inquiry is whether a new and nonobvious functional relationship with the
 known method exists. In *King Pharma,* the court found that the
 relevant determination is whether the "instruction limitation" has a "new and
 unobvious functional relationship" with the known method of administering the drug
 with food. *Id.*. The court held that the relationship was
 non-functional because "[i]nforming a patient about the benefits of a drug in no way
 transforms the process of taking the drug with food." *Id.* That is,
 the actual method of taking a drug with food is the same regardless of whether the
 patient is informed of the benefits. *Id.* "In other words, the
 ‘informing’ limitation ‘in no way depends on the method, and the method does not
 depend on the ‘informing’ limitation.’" *Id.* (citing *In re
 Ngai,* 367 F.3d 1336, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); see also *In re
 Kao,* 639 F.3d 1057, 1072-73, 98 USPQ2d 1799, 1811-12 (Fed. Cir.
 2011).

# 2112.02 Process Claims [R-10.2019]

**I.** **PROCESS CLAIMS — PRIOR ART DEVICE ANTICIPATES A CLAIMED PROCESS IF THE DEVICE
 CARRIES OUT THE PROCESS DURING NORMAL OPERATION**Under the principles of inherency, if a prior art device, in its
 normal and usual operation, would necessarily perform the method claimed, then the
 method claimed will be considered to be anticipated by the prior art device. When the
 prior art device is the same as a device described in the specification for carrying
 out the claimed method, it can be assumed the device will inherently perform the
 claimed process. *In re King,* 801 F.2d 1324, 231 USPQ 136 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986) (The claims were directed to a method of enhancing color effects produced
 by ambient light through a process of absorption and reflection of the light off a
 coated substrate. A prior art reference to *Donley* disclosed a
 glass substrate coated with silver and metal oxide 200-800 angstroms thick. While
 Donley disclosed using the coated substrate to produce architectural colors, the
 absorption and reflection mechanisms of the claimed process were not disclosed.
 However, King’s specification disclosed using a coated substrate of Donley’s
 structure for use in his process. The Federal Circuit upheld the Board’s finding that
 
 "Donley inherently performs the function
 disclosed in the method claims on appeal when that device is used in ‘normal and
 usual operation’"
 
 
 and found that a *prima
 facie* case of anticipation was made out. *Id.* at 138,
 801 F.2d at 1326. It was up to applicant to prove that Donley's structure would not
 perform the claimed method when placed in ambient light.). See also *In re
 Best,* 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977) (Applicant
 claimed a process for preparing a hydrolytically-stable zeolitic aluminosilicate
 which included a step of "cooling the steam zeolite ... at a rate sufficiently rapid
 that the cooled zeolite exhibits an X-ray diffraction pattern ...." All the process
 limitations were expressly disclosed by a U.S. patent to Hansford except the cooling
 step. The court stated that any sample of Hansford’s zeolite would necessarily be
 cooled to facilitate subsequent handling. Therefore, rejections under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** were properly made. Applicant
 had failed to introduce any evidence comparing X-ray diffraction patterns showing a
 difference in cooling rate between the claimed process and that of Hansford or any
 data showing that the process of Hansford would result in a product with a different
 X-ray diffraction. Either type of evidence would have rebutted the rejections under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. A further analysis would be necessary to determine if the
 process was nonobvious under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.); *Ex
 parte**Novitski,* 26 USPQ2d 1389 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993) (The
 Board rejected a claim directed to a method for protecting a plant from plant
 pathogenic nematodes by inoculating the plant with a nematode inhibiting strain of
 *P. cepacia.* A U.S. patent to *Dart* disclosed
 inoculation using *P. cepacia* type Wisconsin 526 bacteria for
 protecting the plant from fungal disease. Dart was silent as to nematode inhibition
 but the Board concluded that nematode inhibition was an inherent property of the
 bacteria. The Board noted that applicant had stated in the specification that
 Wisconsin 526 possesses an 18% nematode inhibition rating.). 
 

**II.** **PROCESS OF USE CLAIMS — NEW AND NONOBVIOUS USES OF OLD STRUCTURES AND
 COMPOSITIONS MAY BE PATENTABLE**The discovery of a new use for an old structure based on unknown
 properties of the structure might be patentable to the discoverer as a process of
 using. *In re Hack,* 245 F.2d 246, 248, 114 USPQ 161, 163 (CCPA
 1957). However, when the claim recites using an old composition or structure and the
 "use" is directed to a result or property of that composition or structure, then the
 claim is anticipated. *In re**May,* 574 F.2d 1082, 1090, 197 USPQ 601, 607 (CCPA 1978) (Claims 1
 and 6, directed to a method of effecting nonaddictive analgesia (pain reduction) in
 animals, were found to be anticipated by the applied prior art which disclosed the
 same compounds for effecting analgesia but which was silent as to addiction. The
 court upheld the rejection and stated that the applicants had merely found a new
 property of the compound and such a discovery did not constitute a new use. The court
 went on to reverse the obviousness rejection of claims 2-5 and 7-10 which recited a
 process of using a new compound. The court relied on evidence showing that the
 nonaddictive property of the new compound was unexpected.). See also  *In re
 Tomlinson,* 363 F.2d 928, 150 USPQ 623 (CCPA 1966) (The claim was
 directed to a process of inhibiting light degradation of polypropylene by mixing it
 with one of a genus of compounds, including nickel dithiocarbamate. A reference
 taught mixing polypropylene with nickel dithiocarbamate to lower heat degradation.

 with the nickel dithiocarbamate and that the preamble of the claim was merely
 directed to the result of mixing the two materials. "While the references do not show
 a specific recognition of that result, its discovery by appellants is tantamount only
 to finding a property in the old composition." 363 F.2d at
 934, 150 USPQ at 628 (emphasis in original)).
