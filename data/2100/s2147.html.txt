#### *Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103   
 Conditions for patentability; non-obvious
 subject matter.*


\*\*\*\*\*


* (b)
	+ (1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), and upon timely election by
	 the applicant for patent to proceed under this subsection, a
	 biotechnological process using or resulting in a composition of matter that
	 is novel under **[section 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
	 nonobvious under subsection (a) of this section shall be considered
	 nonobvious if-
		- (A) claims to the process and the composition of matter
		 are contained in either the same application for patent or in separate
		 applications having the same effective filing date; and
		- (B) the composition of matter, and the process at the time
		 it was invented, were owned by the same person or subject to an
		 obligation of assignment to the same person.
	+ (2) A patent issued on a process under paragraph (1)-
		- (A) shall also contain the claims to the composition of
		 matter used in or made by that process, or
		- (B) shall, if such composition of matter is claimed in
		 another patent, be set to expire on the same date as such other
		 patent, notwithstanding **[section 154](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19854_1ee)**.
	+ (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "biotechnological
	 process" means-
		- (A) a process of genetically altering or otherwise
		 inducing a single- or multi-celled organism to-
			* (i) express an exogenous nucleotide sequence,
			* (ii) inhibit, eliminate, augment, or alter expression
			 of an endogenous nucleotide sequence, or
			* (iii) express a specific physiological characteristic
			 not naturally associated with said organism;
		- (B) cell fusion procedures yielding a cell line that
		 expresses a specific protein, such as a monoclonal antibody; and
		- (C) a method of using a product produced by a process
		 defined by subparagraph (A) or (B), or a combination of subparagraphs
		 (A) and (B).

**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is applicable to biotechnological processes only.
 **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** precludes a rejection of process claims which involve the use
 or making of certain nonobvious biotechnological compositions of matter under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. Only applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 are subject to **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302462)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)**.
 


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** requires that:
 


* (A) the biotechnological process and composition of matter be contained
 in either the same application or in separate applications having the same effective
 filing date;
* (B) both the biotechnological process and composition of matter be owned
 or subject to an assignment to the same person at the time the process was
 invented;
* (C) a patent issued on the process also contain the claims to the
 composition of matter used in or made by the process, or, if the process and
 composition of matter are in different patents, the patents expire on the same
 date;
* (D) the biotechnological process falls within the definition set forth in
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**; and
* (E) a timely election be made to proceed under the provisions of
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.


An election to proceed under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** shall be made
 by way of petition under **[37 CFR 1.182](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324988)**. The petition must establish that all the requirements
 set forth in **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** have been satisfied.
 


An election will normally be considered timely if it is made no later than
 the earlier of either the payment of the issue fee or the filing of an appeal brief in an
 application which contains a composition of matter claim which has not been rejected under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.
 


In an application where at least one composition of matter claim has not
 been rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** election may be made by submitting the petition and an
 amendment requesting entry of process claims which correspond to the composition of matter
 claim.
 


For applications pending on or after November 1, 1995, in which the issue
 fee has been paid prior to March 26, 1996, the timeliness requirement for an election under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** will be considered satisfied if the conditions of 37 CFR
 1.312(b) are met. However, if a patent is granted on an application entitled to the benefit
 of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** without an election having been made as a result of error,
 patentees may file a reissue application to permit consideration of process claims which
 qualify for **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** treatment. See **[MPEP § 1412.02](s1412.html#d0e136811)**, subsection II.
 


See **[MPEP §
 2116.01](s2116.html#d0e201660)** for a discussion of the Federal Circuit’s decisions in
 *In re Ochiai,* 71 F.3d 1565, 37 USPQ 1127 (Fed. Cir. 1995) and
 *In re Brouwer,* 77 F.3d 422, 37 USPQ2d 1663 (Fed. Cir. 1996)
 which address the general issue of whether an otherwise conventional process could be
 patented if it were limited to making or using a nonobvious product. In view of the Federal
 Circuit’s decisions in *Ochiai* and *Brouwer*, an
 applicant’s need to rely upon **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be
 rare. See also 1184 OG 86 (Comm’r Pat. 1996). See **[35 U.S.C. 282](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845)** for the effect of a
 determination of nonobviousness under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** on the
 presumption of validity.
