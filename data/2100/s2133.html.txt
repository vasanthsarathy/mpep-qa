# 2133 Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **not applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as
 set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is subject to
 examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to those
 provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_18e23_3ce)** et seq. for a detailed

#### *Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102   
 Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of right to patent.*


A person shall be entitled to a patent unless -


\*\*\*\*\*


* (b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication
 in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more
 than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United
 States.


\*\*\*\*\*


**I.** **THE 1-YEAR GRACE PERIOD IS EXTENDED TO THE NEXT WORKING DAY IF IT WOULD OTHERWISE
 END ON A HOLIDAY OR WEEKEND**Publications, patents, public uses and sales must occur "more than one
 year prior to the date of application for patent in the United States" in order to bar a
 patent under **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. However, applicant’s own activity will not bar a
 patent if the 1-year grace period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday and
 the application’s U.S. filing date is the next succeeding business day. *Ex
 parte Olah,* 131 USPQ 41 (Bd. App. 1960). Despite changes to
 **[37 CFR
 1.6(a)(2)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313447)** and **[37 CFR 1.10](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313951)** which require the PTO to
 accord a filing date to an application as of the date of deposit as Priority Express
 Mail® with the U.S. Postal Service in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.10](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313951)** (e.g.,
 a Saturday filing date), the rule changes do not affect applicant's concurrent right to
 defer the filing of an application until the next business day when the last day for
 "taking any action" falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday (e.g., the last
 day of the 1-year grace period falls on a Saturday).
 

**II.** **THE 1-YEAR TIME BAR IS MEASURED FROM THE U.S. FILING DATE**If one discloses one's own work more than 1 year before the filing of
 the patent application, that person is barred from obtaining a patent. *In re
 Katz,* 687 F.2d 450, 454, 215 USPQ 14, 17 (CCPA 1982). The 1-year time bar
 is measured from the U.S. filing date. Thus, applicant will be barred from obtaining a
 patent if the public came into possession of the invention on a date before the 1-year
 grace period ending with the U.S. filing date. It does not matter how the public came
 into possession of the invention. Public possession could occur by a public use, public
 sale, a publication, a patent or any combination of these. In addition, the prior art
 need not be identical to the claimed invention but will bar patentability if it is an
 obvious variant thereof. *In re Foster,* 343 F.2d 980, 145 USPQ 166
 (CCPA 1966). See **[MPEP § 2139.01](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_12530_2b6)** regarding the effective
 U.S. filing date of an application. 
 



# 2133.01 Rejections of Continuation-In-Part (CIP) Applications [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **not applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA
 as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to
 those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_18e23_3ce)** et seq. for a detailed
 discussion of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) and
 (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


The effective filing date of a claimed invention is determined on a
 claim-by-claim basis and not an application-by-application basis. See
 **[MPEP §
 2139.01](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_12530_2b6)** for guidance in determining the effective filing date
 of a claimed invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 


When applicant files a continuation-in-part application,
 none of whose claims are supported by the parent application under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, the effective filing date is the filing date
 of the child CIP. Any prior art disclosing the invention or an obvious variant thereof
 having a critical reference date more than 1 year prior to the filing date of the child
 will bar the issuance of a patent under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. *Paperless Accounting v. Bay Area Rapid Transit System,* 804 F.2d 659, 665,
 231 USPQ 649, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1986). 
 


Any claim that only contains subject matter that is
 fully supported in compliance with the statutory requirements of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, by the parent application of a CIP will have
 the effective filing date of the parent application. On the other hand, any claim that
 contains a limitation that is only supported as required by **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, by the disclosure of the CIP application
 will have the effective filing date of the CIP application. See, e.g.,*Santarus, Inc. v. Par Pharmaceutical, Inc.,* 694 F.3d 1344, 104 USPQ2d 1641
 (Fed. Cir. 2012)(patent issuing from parent application was relied upon as prior art
 against the claims in CIPs that did not find support in the parent application);
 *Studiengesellschaft Kohle, m.b.H. v. Shell Oil Co.,* 112 F.3d 1561,
 1564, 42 USPQ2d 1674 (Fed. Cir. 1997)("To qualify for an earlier filing date, section
 120 requires, *inter alia,* that the earlier-filed U.S. patent
 application contain a disclosure which complies with **[35 U.S.C. § 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, p 1 (1994) for each
 claim in the newly filed application. Thus, this benefit only applies to claims that
 recite subject matter adequately described in an earlier application, and does not
 extend to claims with subject matter outside the description in the earlier
 application."). 
 




# 2133.02 Rejections Based on Publications and Patents [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **not applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA
 as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to
 those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_18e23_3ce)** et seq. for a detailed
 discussion of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) and
 (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**I.** **APPLICANT’S OWN WORK WHICH WAS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE THE GRACE PERIOD
 MAY BE USED IN A PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b) REJECTION**"Any invention described in a printed publication more than one year
 prior to the date of a patent application is prior art under **[Section 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**,
 even if the printed publication was authored by the patent applicant." *De
 Graffenried v.**United States,* 16 USPQ2d 1321, 1330 n.7 (Cl. Ct. 1990). "Once an
 inventor has decided to lift the veil of secrecy from his [or her] work, he [or she]
 must choose between the protection of a federal patent, or the dedication of his [or
 her] idea to the public at large." *Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft
 Boats, Inc.,* 489 U.S. 141, 148, 9 USPQ2d 1847, 1851 (1989).
 

**II.** **A PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b) REJECTION CREATES A STATUTORY BAR TO PATENTABILITY
 OF THE REJECTED CLAIMS** A rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** cannot
 be overcome by affidavits and declarations under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** (Rule 131 Declarations), foreign priority dates, or
 evidence that applicant himself invented the subject matter. Outside the 1-year grace
 period, applicant is barred from obtaining a patent containing any anticipated or
 obvious claims. *In re Foster,* 343 F.2d 980, 984, 145 USPQ 166, 170
 (CCPA 1965).
 



# 2133.02(a) Overcoming a Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)
 Rejection Based on a Printed Publication or Patent [R-10.2019]


In all applications, an applicant may overcome a
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** rejection by persuasively arguing that the claims
 are patentably distinguishable from the prior art, or by amending the claims to
 patentably distinguish over the prior art. Additional ways available to overcome a
 rejection based on **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** prior art depend on the applicable
 paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[MPEP § 2132.01](s2132.html#d0e203530)** for
 overcoming a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 **[MPEP §
 2136.05](s2136.html#d0e206333)***et seq.* for overcoming a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**. 
 


A rejection based on **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)** can be
 overcome by:
 


* (A) Persuasively arguing that the claims are patentably
 distinguishable from the prior art;
* (B) Amending the claims to patentably distinguish over the prior
 art;
* (C) Submitting and perfecting a benefit claim under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, within the time period set in
 **[37 CFR
 1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320670)** (or by filing a grantable petition to accept an
 unintentionally delayed claim under **[37 CFR 1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320670)** as explained in
 **[MPEP § 211.04](s211.html#ch200_d1ff71_24f8b_4a)**):
	+ (1)
		- (a) for applications filed on or after
		 September 16, 2012, by filing a corrected application data sheet
		 under **[37 CFR 1.76](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e320348)**
		 which contains a specific reference to a prior application in
		 accordance with **[37 CFR 1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320662)**, or
		- (b) for applications filed prior to
		 September 16, 2012, by amending the specification of the
		 application to contain a specific reference to a prior application
		 or by filing a corrected application data sheet under
		 **[37 CFR 1.76](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320348)**
		 which contains a specific reference to a prior application in
		 accordance with **[37 CFR
		 1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320662)**,
	and
	+ (2) by establishing that the prior application
	 satisfies the enablement and written description requirements of
	 **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)** (for applications filed on or
	 after September 16, 2012), or **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
	 paragraph (for applications filed prior to September 16, 2012). See
	 **[MPEP § 211](s211.html#ch200_d1ff71_1bd25_18b)** *et
	 seq.*;or
* (D) Submitting and perfecting a benefit claim under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)** by complying with the requirements of
 **[37 CFR
 1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320670)** or filing a grantable petition to accept an
 unintentionally delayed claim under **[37 CFR 1.78](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e320670)** (see item (C)
 above). Because a provisional application could not have been filed more than
 one year prior to the filing of a nonprovisional application that claims
 benefit to the provisional application, once the benefit claim under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)**) is perfected, the rejection must be reconsidered
 to determine whether the prior art still qualifies as prior art under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** or whether the prior art qualifies as prior
 art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**. Note, however, effective
 December 18, 2013, title II of the Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act
 (PLTIA) provides for restoration of the right to claim benefit of a provisional
 application filed after the expiration of the twelve-month period in
 **[35 U.S.C.
 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)**. See **[MPEP §
 211.01(a)](s211.html#ch200_d1ff71_20a5e_149)**, subsection II. If the prior art qualifies
 as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**,
 see **[MPEP §
 2132.01](s2132.html#d0e203530)** as to how to overcome the **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** rejection.





# 2133.03 Rejections Based on "Public Use" or "On Sale" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to
 those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)** for a
 detailed discussion of the public use and on sale provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


An applicant may make an admission, or submit evidence of
 sale of the invention or knowledge of the invention by others, or the examiner may have
 personal knowledge that the invention was sold by applicant or known by others. If the
 activity is by an entity other than the inventors or assignee, such as sale by another,
 manufacture by another or disclosure of the invention by the inventor or assignee to
 another then both **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** may be applicable. If the
 evidence only points to knowledge within the year prior to the effective filing date
 then **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** applies. However, no rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** should be made if there is evidence that applicant made the
 invention and only disclosed it to others within the year prior to the effective filing
 date. **[Pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is applicable if the activity occurred more than 1
 year prior to the effective filing date of the application.
 


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** "contains several distinct bars to patentability, each of
 which relates to activity or disclosure more than one year prior to the date of the
 application. Two of these - the ‘public use’ and the ‘on sale’ objections - are
 sometimes considered together although it is quite clear that either may apply when the
 other does not." *Dart Indus. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.,*
 489 F.2d 1359, 1365, 179 USPQ 392, 396 (7th Cir. 1973). There may be a public use of an
 invention absent any sales activity. Likewise, there may be a nonpublic, e.g., "secret,"
 sale or offer to sell an invention which nevertheless constitutes a statutory bar.
 *Hobbs v.**United States,* 451 F.2d 849, 859-60, 171 USPQ 713, 720 (5th Cir.
 1971).
 


In similar fashion, not all "public use" and "on sale" activities will
 necessarily occasion the identical result. Although both activities affect how an
 inventor may use an invention prior to the filing of a patent application,
 "non-commercial" **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** activity may not be viewed the same as
 similar "commercial" activity. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)** and
 **[§ 2133.03(e)(1)](s2133.html#d0e204712)**. Likewise, "public use" activity by
 an applicant may not be considered in the same light as similar "public use" activity by
 one other than  an applicant. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)** and
 **[§ 2133.03(e)(7)](s2133.html#d0e205133)**. Additionally, the concept of "experimental
 use" may have different significance in "commercial" and "non-commercial" environments.
 See **[MPEP
 § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)** and **[§ 2133.03(e)](s2133.html#d0e204670)** - **[§ 2133.03(e)(6)](s2133.html#d0e205061)**. 
 


It should be noted that **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** may create
 a bar to patentability either alone, if the device in public use or placed on sale
 anticipates a later claimed invention, or in conjunction with **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, if
 the claimed invention would have been obvious from the device in conjunction with the
 prior art. *LaBounty Mfg.**v.**United States Int’l Trade Comm’n,* 958 F.2d 1066, 1071, 22 USPQ2d
 1025, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
 

 **POLICY CONSIDERATIONS*** (A) "One policy underlying the [on-sale] bar is to obtain
 widespread disclosure of new inventions to the public via patents as soon as
 possible." *RCA Corp*. *v. Data Gen. Corp.,*
 887 F.2d 1056, 1062, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1454 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
* (B) Another policy underlying the public use and on-sale bars is
 to prevent the inventor from commercially exploiting the exclusivity of his [or
 her] invention substantially beyond the statutorily authorized period.
 *RCA Corp.**v.**Data Gen. Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1062, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1454
 (Fed. Cir. 1989). See **[MPEP § 2133.03(e)(1)](s2133.html#d0e204712)**.
* (C) Another underlying policy for the public use and on-sale bars
 is to discourage "the removal of inventions from the public domain which the
 public justifiably comes to believe are freely available." *Manville
 Sales**Corp. v. Paramount Sys., Inc.,* 917 F.2d 544, 549, 16 USPQ2d
 1587, 1591 (Fed. Cir. 1990).

 424 F.3d 1374, 76 USPQ2d 1741 (Fed. Cir. 2005). As explained by the court,

*Id.* at 1380, 76 USPQ2d at 1744 (citations omitted). See
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e203781)** for a discussion of the "ready for patenting"
 prong of the public use and on sale statutory bars.
 


"[T]o constitute the public use of an invention it is not
 necessary that more than one of the patent articles should be publicly used. The
 use of a great number may tend to strengthen the proof, but one well defined case
 of such use is just as effectual to annul the patent as many." Likewise, it is not
 necessary that more than one person use the invention. *Egbert
 v.**Lippmann,* 104 U.S. 333, 336 (1881).
 

**II.** **PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE IS NOT NECESSARILY PUBLIC USE UNDER Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)**Mere knowledge of the invention by the public does not warrant
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bars public use or sale, not public knowledge.
 *TP**Labs., Inc. v. Professional Positioners, Inc.,* 724 F.2d 965,
 970, 220 USPQ 577, 581 (Fed. Cir. 1984).
 


Note, however, that public knowledge may provide grounds for
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[MPEP § 2132](s2132.html#d0e203390)**. 
 

***A.*** ***Commercial Versus Noncommercial Use and the Impact of
 Secrecy***There are limited circumstances in which a secret or
 confidential use of an invention may give rise to the public use bar.
 "[S]ecrecy of use alone is not sufficient to show that existing knowledge has
 not been withdrawn from public use; commercial exploitation is also forbidden."
 *Invitrogen,* 424 F.3d at 1382, 76 USPQ2d at 1745-46 (The
 fact that patentee secretly used the claimed invention internally before the
 critical date to develop future products that were never sold was by itself
 insufficient to create a public use bar to patentability.).
 

**1.** **"Public Use" and "Non-secret Use" Are Not Necessarily
 Synonymous**"Public" is not necessarily synonymous with "non- secret."
 The fact "that non-secret uses of the device were made [by the inventor or
 someone connected with the inventor] prior to the critical date is not
 itself dispositive of the issue of whether activity barring a patent under
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** occurred. The fact that the device
 was not hidden from view may make the use not secret, but nonsecret use is
 not *ipso facto* ‘public use’ activity. Nor, it must be
 added, is all secret use *ipso facto* not ‘public use’
 within the meaning of the statute," if the inventor is making commercial use
 of the invention under circumstances which preserve its secrecy. *TP
 Labs., Inc.**v.**Professional Positioners, Inc.,* 724 F.2d 965, 972, 220
 USPQ 577, 583 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (citations omitted). 
 

**2.** **Even If the Invention Is Hidden, Inventor Who Puts Machine or Article
 Embodying the Invention in Public View Is Barred from Obtaining a Patent
 as the Invention Is in Public Use** When the inventor or someone connected to the inventor puts
 the invention on display or sells it, there is a "public use" within the
 meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** even though by its very
 nature an invention is completely hidden from view as part of a larger
 machine or article, if the invention is otherwise used in its natural and
 intended way and the larger machine or article is accessible to the public.
 *In re Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 783, 113 USPQ 289, 292
 (CCPA 1957); *Hall**v. Macneale,* 107 U.S. 90, 96-97 (1882); *Ex
 parte**Kuklo,* 25 USPQ2d 1387, 1390 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992) (Display of equipment including the structural features of the claimed
 invention to visitors of laboratory is public use even though public did not
 see inner workings of device. The person to whom the invention is publicly
 disclosed need not understand the significance and technical complexities of
 the invention.).
 

**3.** **There Is No Public Use If Inventor Restricted Use to Locations Where
 There Was a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy and the Use Was for His or
 Her Own Enjoyment** An inventor’s private use of the invention, for his or her
 own enjoyment is not a public use. *Moleculon Research
 Corp.**v. CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809
 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Inventor showed inventive puzzle to close friends while in
 his dorm room and later the president of the company at which he was working
 saw the puzzle on the inventor’s desk and they discussed it. Court held that
 the inventor retained control and thus these actions did not result in a
 "public use.").
 

**4.** **The Presence or Absence of a Confidentiality Agreement is Not
 Dispositive of the Public Use Issue**"The presence or absence of a confidentiality agreement is
 not dispositive of the public use issue, but ‘is one factor to be considered
 in assessing all the evidence.’" *Bernhardt, L.L.C. v. Collezione
 Europa USA, Inc.,* 386 F.3d 1371, 1380-81, 72 USPQ2d 1901, 1909
 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting *Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS
 Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1266, 229 USPQ 805, 808 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).
 The court stressed that it is necessary to analyze the evidence of public
 use in the context of policies that underlie the public use and on sale bar
 that include "‘discouraging removal of inventions from the public domain
 that the public justifiably believes are freely available, prohibiting an
 extension of the period for exploiting an invention, and favoring prompt and
 widespread disclosure of inventions.’" *Bernhardt,* 386
 F.3d at 1381, 72 USPQ2d at 1909. See also *Invitrogen,* 424
 F.3d at 1379, 76 USPQ2d at 1744; **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**, subsection
 I. Evidence that the court emphasized included the "‘nature of the activity
 that occurred in public; the public access to and knowledge of the public
 use; [and] whether there were any confidentiality obligations imposed on
 persons who observed the use.’" *Bernhardt,* 386 F.3d at
 1381, 72 USPQ2d at 1909. For example, the court in
 *Bernhardt* noted that an exhibition display at issue in
 the case "was not open to the public, that the identification of attendees
 was checked against a list of authorized names by building security and
 later at a reception desk near the showroom, that attendees were escorted
 through the showroom, and that the attendees were not permitted to make
 written notes or take photographs inside the showroom."
 *Id.* The court remanded the issue of whether the
 exhibition display was a public use for further proceedings since the
 district court "focused on the absence of any confidentiality agreements and
 did not discuss or analyze how the totality of the circumstances
 surrounding" the exhibition "comports with the policies underlying the
 public use bar." *Id.*

***B.*** ***Use by Third Parties Deriving the Invention from
 Applicant**** 

**An Invention Is in Public Use If the Inventor Allows Another To Use
 the Invention Without Restriction or Obligation of Secrecy**"Public use" of a claimed invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** occurs when the inventor allows another person
 to use the invention without limitation, restriction or obligation of
 secrecy to the inventor."  *In re Smith,* 714 F.2d 1127,
 1134, 218 USPQ 976, 983 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The presence or absence of a
 confidentiality agreement is not itself determinative of the public use
 issue, but is one factor to be considered along with the time, place, and
 circumstances of the use which show the amount of control the inventor
 retained over the invention. *Moleculon Research Corp.**v. CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809
 (Fed. Cir. 1986). See *Ex parte C,* 27 USPQ2d 1492, 1499
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (Inventor sold inventive soybean seeds to
 growers who contracted and were paid to plant the seeds to increase stock
 for later sale. The commercial nature of the use of the seed coupled with
 the "on-sale" aspects of the contract and apparent lack of confidentiality
 requirements rose to the level of a "public use" bar.); *Egbert
 v.**Lippmann,* 104 U.S. 333, 336 (1881) (Public use found
 where inventor allowed another to use inventive corset insert, though hidden
 from view during use, because he did not impose an obligation of secrecy or
 restrictions on its use.). 
 

***C.*** ***Use by Independent Third Parties**** 

Use by an Independent Third Party Is Public Use If
 It Sufficiently "Informs" the Public of the Invention or a Competitor Could
 Reasonably Ascertain the Invention
 Any "nonsecret" use of an invention by someone unconnected
 to the inventor, such as someone who has independently made the invention,
 in the ordinary course of a business for trade or profit may be a "public
 use," *Bird Provision Co. v. Owens Country Sausage,**Inc.,* 568 F.2d 369, 374-76, 197 USPQ 134, 138-40 (5th
 Cir. 1978). Additionally, even a "secret" use by another inventor of a
 machine or process to make a product is "public" if the details of the
 machine or process are ascertainable by inspection or analysis of the
 product that is sold or publicly displayed. *Gillman v.
 Stern,* 114 F.2d 28, 46 USPQ 430 (2d Cir. 1940); *Dunlop
 Holdings, Ltd. v. Ram Golf Corp.,* 524 F.2d 33, 36-7, 188 USPQ
 481, 483-484 (7th Cir. 1975). If the details of an inventive process are not
 ascertainable from the product sold or displayed and the third party has
 kept the invention as a trade secret then that use is not a public use and
 will not bar a patent issuing to someone unconnected to the user.
 *W.L. Gore & Assocs. v. Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d
 1540, 1550, 220 USPQ 303, 310 (Fed. Cir. 1983). However, a device qualifies
 as prior art if it places the claimed features in the
 public's possession before the critical date even if other
 unclaimed aspects of the device were not publicly
 available. *Lockwood v. American Airlines, Inc.,* 107 F.3d
 1505, 1570-71, 41 USPQ2d 1961, 1964-65 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Computer
 reservation system was prior art even though "essential algorithms of the
 SABRE software were proprietary and confidential and...those aspects of the
 system that were readily apparent to the public would not have been
 sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to duplicate the [unclaimed
 aspects of the] system."). The extent that the public becomes "informed" of
 an invention involved in public use activity by one other than an applicant
 depends upon the factual circumstances surrounding the activity and how
 these comport with the policies underlying the on sale and public use bars.
 *Manville Sales Corp. v. Paramount Sys., Inc*., 917 F.2d
 544, 549, 16 USPQ2d 1587, 1591 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (quoting *King
 Instrument Corp.**v. Otari Corp.,* 767 F.2d 833, 860, 226 USPQ 402, 406
 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). By way of example, in an allegedly "secret" use by a
 third party other than an applicant, if a large number of employees of such
 a party, who are not under a promise of secrecy, are permitted unimpeded
 access to an invention, with affirmative steps by the party to educate other
 employees as to the nature of the invention, the public is "informed."
 *Chemithon Corp.**v.**Proctor & Gamble Co.,* 287 F. Supp. 291, 308, 159 USPQ
 139, 154 (D.Md. 1968), *aff’d.,* 427 F.2d 893, 165 USPQ 678
 (4th Cir. 1970).
 


Even if public use activity by one other than an applicant
 is not sufficiently "informing," there may be adequate grounds upon which to
 base a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See  *Dunlop
 Holdings Ltd. v. Ram Golf Corp.,* 524 F.2d 33, 188 USPQ 481 (7th
 Cir. 1975). See **[MPEP § 2137](s2137.html#d0e206570)** and

# 2133.03(b) "On Sale" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** . See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to
 those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)** for
 a detailed discussion of the public use and on sale provisions of
 **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


An impermissible sale has occurred if there was a definite sale, or
 offer to sell, more than 1 year before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention and the subject matter of the sale, or offer to sell, fully anticipated the
 claimed invention or would have rendered the claimed invention obvious by its
 addition to the prior art. *Ferag AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45 F.3d 1562,
 1565, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1514 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The on-sale bar of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is triggered if the invention is both (1) the subject of
 a commercial offer for sale not primarily for experimental purposes and (2) ready for
 patenting. *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48 USPQ2d
 1641, 1646-47 (1998). Traditional contract law principles are applied when
 determining whether a commercial offer for sale has occurred. See *Linear
 Tech. Corp. v. Micrel, Inc.,* 275 F.3d 1040, 1048, 61 USPQ2d 1225, 1229
 (Fed. Cir. 2001), *petition for cert. filed,* 71 USLW 3093 (July 03,
 2002) (No. 02-39); *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc.,* 254
 F.3d 1041,1047, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("As a general proposition, we
 will look to the Uniform Commercial Code (‘UCC’) to define whether … a communication
 or series of communications rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale.").
 

**I.** **THE MEANING OF "SALE"**A sale is a contract between parties wherein the seller agrees
 "to give and to pass rights of property" in return for the buyer’s payment or
 promise "to pay the seller for the things bought or sold." *In re
 Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 676, 226 USPQ 1, 4 (Fed. Cir. 1985). A
 contract for the sale of goods requires a concrete offer and acceptance of that
 offer. See, e.g., *Linear Tech.,* 275 F.3d at 1052-54, 61 USPQ2d
 at 1233-34 (Court held there was no sale within the meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** where prospective purchaser submitted an order for
 goods at issue, but received an order acknowledgement reading "will advise-not
 booked." Prospective purchaser would understand that order was not accepted.).
 


"[T]o be ‘on sale’ under **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, a
 product must be the subject of a commercial sale or offer for sale," and to be a
 commercial sale it must be "one that bears the general hallmarks of a sale
 pursuant to Section 2-106 of the Uniform Commercial Code." *Medicines Co.
 v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363, 1364 119 USPQ2d 1329, 1330 (Fed.
 Cir. 2016) (en banc). The court in *Medicines Co.* went on to
 explain "[s]ection 2-106(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code describes a ‘sale’ as
 ‘the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.’ U.C.C. §
 2-106(1). The passage of title is a helpful indicator of whether a product is ‘on
 sale,’ as it suggests when the inventor gives up its interest and control over the
 product." *Id.* at 1375, 119 USPQ2d at 1338. The
 *Medicines Co.* court held "a contract manufacturer’s sale to
 the inventor of manufacturing services where neither title to the embodiments nor
 the right to market the same passes to the supplier does not constitute an
 invalidating sale under **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**."
 *Id.* at 1381, 119 USPQ2d at 1342.
 

***A.******Conditional Sale May Bar a Patent***An invention may be deemed to be "on sale" even though the
 sale was conditional. The fact that the sale is conditioned on buyer
 satisfaction does not, without more, prove that the sale was for an
 experimental purpose. *Strong v. General Elec. Co.,* 434 F.2d
 1042, 1046, 168 USPQ 8, 12 (5th Cir. 1970).
 

***B.******Nonprofit Sale May Bar a Patent***A "sale" need not be for profit to bar a patent. If the sale
 was for the commercial exploitation of the invention, it is "on sale" within
 the meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *In re Dybel,* 524 F.2d 1393, 1401, 187 USPQ 593, 599 (CCPA
 1975) ("Although selling the devices for a profit would have demonstrated the
 purpose of commercial exploitation, the fact that appellant realized no profit
 from the sales does not demonstrate the contrary.").
 

***C.******A Single Sale or Offer To Sell May Bar a Patent***Even a single sale or offer to sell the invention may bar
 patentability under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *Consolidated**Fruit-Jar Co. v. Wright,* 94 U.S. 92, 94 (1876);
 *Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp.,* 970 F.2d
 834, 836-37, 23 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
 

***D.******A Sale of Rights Is Not a Sale of the Invention and Will Not in
 Itself Bar a Patent***"[A]n assignment or sale of the rights in the invention and
 potential patent rights is not a sale of ‘the invention’ within the meaning of
 **[[pre-AIA]
 section 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**." *Moleculon Research Corp. v.
 CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1267, 229 USPQ 805, 809 (Fed. Cir.
 1986); see also *Elan Corp., PLC v. Andrx Pharms. Inc.,*
 366 F.3d 1336, 1341, 70 USPQ2d 1722, 1728 (Fed. Cir. 2004); *In re
 Kollar,* 286 F.3d 1326, 1330 n.3, 1330-1331, 62 USPQ2d 1425, 1428
 n.3, 1428-1429 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (distinguishing licenses which trigger the
 on-sale bar (e.g., a standard computer software license wherein the product is
 just as immediately transferred to the licensee as if it were sold), from
 licenses that merely grant rights to an invention which do not *per
 se* trigger the on-sale bar (e.g., exclusive rights to market the
 invention or potential patent rights)); *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark
 Cards, Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041, 1049 n. 2, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1129 n. 2
 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
 


"[T]he mere sale of manufacturing services by a
 contract manufacturer to an inventor to create embodiments of a patented
 product for the inventor does not constitute a ‘commercial sale’ of the
 invention." *Medicines Co. v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363,
 1373 119 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (*en banc*). The
 court in *Medicines Co.* further stated that "commercial
 benefit—even to both parties in a transaction—is not enough to trigger the
 on-sale bar of **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**; the transaction
 must be one in which the product is ‘on sale’ in the sense that it is
 ‘commercially marketed.’" *Id.* at 1373-74, 119 USPQ2d at
 1336-37.
 

***E.******Buyer Must Be Uncontrolled by the Seller or Offerer***A sale or offer for sale must take place between separate
 entities. *In re Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 676, 226 USPQ 1, 4
 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Where the parties to the alleged sale are related, whether
 there is a statutory bar depends on whether the seller so controls the
 purchaser that the invention remains out of the public’s hands. *Ferag
 AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45 F.3d 1562, 1566, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1515 (Fed.
 Cir. 1995) (Where the seller is a parent company of the buyer company, but the
 President of the buyer company had "essentially unfettered" management
 authority over the operations of the buyer company, the sale was a statutory
 bar.).
 

**II.** **OFFERS FOR SALE**"Only an offer which rises to the level of a commercial offer for
 sale, one which the other party could make into a binding contract by simple
 acceptance (assuming consideration), constitutes an offer for sale under
 **[§102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**." *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards,
 Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041,1048, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 
 

***A.******Rejected or Unreceived Offer for Sale Is Enough To Bar a
 Patent***Since the statute creates a bar when an invention is placed
 "on sale," a mere offer to sell is sufficient commercial activity to bar a
 patent. *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 791, 204 USPQ 188, 192
 (CCPA 1979). Even a rejected offer may create an on sale bar. *UMC
 Elecs. v. United States,* 816 F.2d 647, 653, 2 USPQ2d 1465, 1469
 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In fact, the offer need not even be actually received by a
 prospective purchaser. *Wende v. Horine,* 225 F. 501 (7th Cir.
 1915). 
 

***B.******Delivery of the Offered Item Is Not Required***"It is not necessary that a sale be consummated for the bar to
 operate." *Buildex v. Kason Indus.,**Inc.,* 849 F.2d 1461, 1463-64, 7 USPQ2d 1325, 1327-28 (Fed.
 Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). See also *Weatherchem Corp. v. J.L.
 Clark, Inc.,* 163 F.3d 1326, 1333, 49 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-07 (Fed.
 Cir. 1998) (A signed purchase agreement prior to the critical date constituted
 a commercial offer; it was immaterial that there was no delivery of later
 patented caps and no exchange of money until after critical date.).
 

***C.******Seller Need Not Have the Goods "On Hand" When the Offer for Sale Is
 Made***Goods need not be "on hand" and transferred at the time of the
 sale or offer. The date of the offer for sale is the effective date of the "on
 sale" activity. *J. A. La Porte, Inc. v. Norfolk Dredging
 Co.,* 787 F.2d 1577, 1582, 229 USPQ 435, 438 (Fed. Cir. 1986).
 However, the invention must be complete and "ready for patenting" (see
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)**) before the critical date. *Pfaff
 v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647
 (1998). See also *Micro Chemical, Inc. v. Great Plains Chemical
 Co.,* 103 F.3d 1538, 1545, 41 USPQ2d 1238, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1997)
 (The on-sale bar was not triggered by an offer to sell because the inventor
 "was not close to completion of the invention at the time of the alleged offer
 and had not demonstrated a high likelihood that the invention would work for
 its intended purpose upon completion."); *Shatterproof Glass Corp. v.
 Libbey-Owens Ford Co.,* 758 F.2d 613, 225 USPQ 634 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (Where there was no evidence that the samples shown to the potential customers
 were made by the new process and apparatus, the offer to sell did not rise to
 the level of an on sale bar.). Compare *Barmag Barmer Maschinenfabrik
 AG v. Murata Mach., Ltd.,* 731 F.2d 831, 221 USPQ 561 (Fed. Cir.
 1984) (Where a "make shift" model of the inventive product was shown to the
 potential purchasers in conjunction with the offer to sell, the offer was
 enough to bar a patent under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.).
 
 

***D.******Material Terms of an Offer for Sale Must be Present***"[A] communication that fails to constitute a definite offer
 to sell the product and to include material terms is not an ‘offer’ in the
 contract sense." *Elan Corp., PLC v. Andrx Pharms. Inc.,* 366
 F.3d 1336, 1341, 70 USPQ2d 1722, 1728 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court stated that
 an "offer to enter into a license under a patent for future sale of the
 invention covered by the patent when and if it has been developed... is not an
 offer to sell the patented invention that constitutes an on-sale bar."
 *Id.,* 70 USPQ2d at 1726. Accordingly, the court concluded
 that Elan’s letter was not an offer to sell a product. In addition, the court
 stated that the letter lacked material terms of a commercial offer such as
 pricing for the product, quantities, time and place of delivery, and product
 specifications and that the dollar amount in the letter was not a price term
 for the sale of the product but rather the amount requested was to form and
 continue a partnership, explicitly referred to as a "licensing fee."
 *Id.*

**III.** **SALE BY INVENTOR, ASSIGNEE OR OTHERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVENTOR IN THE
 COURSE OF BUSINESS*****A.******Sale Activity Need Not Be Public***Unlike questions of public use, there is no requirement that
 "on sale" activity be "public." "Public" as used in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** modifies "use" only. "Public" does not modify
 "sale." *Hobbs v. United States,* 451 F.2d 849, 171 USPQ 713,
 720 (5th Cir. 1971). 
 

***B.******Inventor’s Consent to the Sale Is Not a Prerequisite To Finding an
 On Sale Bar***If the invention was placed on sale by a third party who
 obtained the invention from the inventor, a patent is barred even if the
 inventor did not consent to the sale or have knowledge that the invention was
 embodied in the sold article. *Electric Storage Battery Co. v.
 Shimadzu,* 307 U.S. 5, 41 USPQ 155 (1938); *In re
 Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 783, 113 USPQ 289, 292 (CCPA 1957);
 *CTS Corp. v. Electro Materials Corp. of America,* 469 F.
 Supp. 801, 819, 202 USPQ 22, 38 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). 
 

***C.******Objective Evidence of Sale or Offer To Sell Is Needed***In determining if a sale or offer to sell the claimed
 invention has occurred, a key question to ask is whether the inventor sold or
 offered for sale a product that embodies the invention claimed in the
 application. Objective evidence such as a description of the inventive product
 in the contract of sale or in another communication with the purchaser controls
 over an uncommunicated intent by the seller to deliver the inventive product
 under the contract for sale. *Ferag AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45
 F.3d 1562, 1567, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1516 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (On sale bar found where
 initial negotiations and agreement containing contract for sale neither clearly
 specified nor precluded use of the inventive design, but an order confirmation
 prior to the critical date did specify use of inventive design.). The purchaser
 need not have actual knowledge of the invention for it to be on sale. The
 determination of whether "the offered product is in fact the claimed invention
 may be established by any relevant evidence, such as memoranda, drawings,
 correspondence, and testimony of witnesses." *RCA Corp. v. Data Gen.
 Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1060, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 However, "what the purchaser reasonably believes the inventor to be offering is
 relevant to whether, on balance, the offer objectively may be said to be of the
 patented invention." *Envirotech Corp. v. Westech Eng’g,
 Inc.,* 904 F.2d 1571, 1576, 15 USPQ2d 1230, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
 (Where a proposal to supply a general contractor with a product did not mention
 a new design but, rather, referenced a prior art design, the uncommunicated
 intent of the supplier to supply the new design if awarded the contract did not
 constitute an "on sale" bar to a patent on the new design, even though the
 supplier’s bid reflected the lower cost of the new design.). 
 

**IV.** **SALES BY INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES*** 

***A.******Sales or Offers for Sale by Independent Third Parties Will Bar a
 Patent***Sale or offer for sale of the invention by an independent
 third party more than 1 year before the filing date of applicant’s patent will
 bar applicant from obtaining a patent. "An exception to this rule exists where
 a patented method is kept secret and remains secret after a sale of the
 unpatented product of the method. Such a sale prior to the critical date is a
 bar if engaged in by the patentee or patent applicant, but not if engaged in by
 another." *In re Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 675-76, 226 USPQ 1,
 3-4 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 

***B.******Nonprior Art Publications Can Be Used as Evidence of Sale Before
 the Critical Date***Abstracts identifying a product’s vendor containing
 information useful to potential buyers such as whom to contact, price terms,
 documentation, warranties, training and maintenance along with the date of
 product release or installation before the inventor’s critical date may provide
 sufficient evidence of prior sale by a third party to support a rejection based
 on **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. *In re
 Epstein,* 32 F.3d 1559, 31 USPQ2d 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Examiner's
 rejection was based on nonprior art published abstracts which disclosed
 software products meeting the claims. The abstracts specified software release
 dates and dates of first installation which were more than 1 year before
 applicant’s filing date.).

 **[AIA

#### *Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102   
 Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of right to
 patent.*


A person shall be entitled to a patent unless -


\*\*\*\*\*


* (b) the invention was…in public use or on sale in this
 country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent
 in the United States


\*\*\*\*\*


(Emphasis added).


**I.** **THE INVENTION MUST BE "READY FOR PATENTING"**In *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55,
 66-68, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647 (1998), the Supreme Court enunciated a two-prong test
 for determining whether an invention was "on sale" within the meaning of
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** even if it has not yet been reduced to
 practice. "[T]he on-sale bar applies when two conditions are satisfied before the
 critical date [more than one year before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention]. First, the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for
 sale…. Second, the invention must be ready for patenting." *Id.*
 at 67, 119 S.Ct. at 311-12, 48 USPQ2d at 1646-47. 
 


The Federal Circuit explained that the Supreme Court’s "ready for
 patenting" prong applies in the context of both the on sale and public use bars.
 *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing L.P.,* 424 F.3d
 1374, 1379, 76 USPQ2d 1741, 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("A bar under **[[pre-AIA] section
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** arises where, before the critical date, the invention
 is in public use and ready for patenting."). "Ready for patenting," the second
 prong of the *Pfaff* test, "may be satisfied in at least two
 ways: by proof of reduction to practice before the critical date; or by proof that
 prior to the critical date the inventor had prepared drawings or other
 descriptions of the invention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person
 skilled in the art to practice the invention." *Id.* at 67, 199
 S.Ct. at 311-12, 48 USPQ2d at 1647 (The patent was held invalid because the
 invention for a computer chip socket was "ready for patenting" when it was offered
 for sale more than one year prior to the application filing date. Even though the
 invention had not yet been reduced to practice, the manufacturer was able to
 produce the claimed computer chip sockets using the inventor’s detailed drawings
 and specifications, and those sockets contained all elements of invention claimed
 in the patent.). See also *Weatherchem Corp. v. J.L. Clark Inc.,*
 163 F.3d 1326, 1333, 49 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-07 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The invention was
 held "ready for patenting" since the detailed drawings of plastic dispensing caps
 offered for sale "contained each limitation of the claims and were sufficiently
 specific to enable person skilled in art to practice the invention".). 
 


If the invention was actually reduced to practice before being
 sold or offered for sale more than 1 year before filing of the application, a
 patent will be barred. *Vanmoor v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,* 201
 F.3d 1363, 1366-67, 53 USPQ2d 1377, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("Here the pre-critical
 date sales were of completed cartridges made to specifications that remained
 unchanged to the present day, showing that any invention embodied in the accused
 cartridges was reduced to practice before the critical date. The
 *Pfaff* ready for patenting condition is also satisfied
 because the specification drawings, available prior to the critical date, were
 actually used to produce the accused cartridges."); *In re
 Hamilton,* 882 F.2d 1576, 1580, 11 USPQ2d 1890, 1893 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 
 "If a product that is offered for sale
 inherently possesses each of the limitations of the claims, then the invention
 is on sale, whether or not the parties to the transaction recognize that the
 product possesses the claimed characteristics."
 
 
 *Abbott Laboratories v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,* 182 F.3d
 1315, 1319, 51 USPQ2d 1307, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Claim for a particular
 anhydrous crystalline form of a pharmaceutical compound was held invalid under the
 on-sale bar of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, even though the parties to the
 U.S. sales of the foreign manufactured compound did not know the identity of the
 particular crystalline form.); *STX LLC. v. Brine Inc.,* 211 F.3d
 588, 591, 54 USPQ2d 1347, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Claim for a lacrosse stick was
 held invalid under the on-sale bar despite the argument that it was not known at
 the time of sale whether the sticks possessed the recited "improved playing and
 handling characteristics." "Subjective qualities inherent in a product, such as
 ‘improved playing and handling’, cannot serve as an escape hatch to circumvent an
 on-sale bar."). Actual reduction to practice in the context of an on-sale bar
 issue usually requires testing under actual working conditions in such a way as to
 demonstrate the practical utility of an invention for its intended purpose beyond
 the probability of failure, unless by virtue of the very simplicity of an
 invention its practical operativeness is clear. *Field v.
 Knowles,* 183 F.2d 593, 601, 86 USPQ 373, 379 (CCPA 1950);
 *Steinberg v. Seitz,* 517 F.2d 1359, 1363, 186 USPQ 209, 212
 (CCPA 1975). 
 


The invention need not be ready for satisfactory commercial
 marketing for sale to bar a patent. *Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex
 Corp.,* 970 F.2d 834, 836-37, 23 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
 
 

**II.** **INVENTOR HAS SUBMITTED A 37 CFR 1.131 AFFIDAVIT OR DECLARATION**Affidavits or declarations submitted under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** to swear behind a reference may constitute, among
 other things, an admission that an invention was "complete" more than 1 year
 before the filing of an application. See *In re Foster,* 343 F.2d
 980, 987-88, 145 USPQ 166, 173 (CCPA 1965); *Dart Indus. v. E.I. duPont de
 Nemours & Co.,* 489 F.2d 1359, 1365, 179 USPQ 392, 396 (7th Cir.
 1973). Also see **[MPEP
 § 715.10](s715.html#d0e92043)**. 
 

**III.** **SALE OF A PROCESS**A claimed process, which is a series of acts or steps, is not
 sold in the same sense as is a claimed product, device, or apparatus, which is a
 tangible item. "‘Know-how’ describing what the process consists of and how the
 process should be carried out may be sold in the sense that the buyer acquires
 knowledge of the process and obtains the freedom to carry it out pursuant to the
 terms of the transaction. However, such a transaction is not a ‘sale’ of the
 invention within the meaning of **[[pre-AIA] §102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** because the
 process has not been carried out or performed as a result of the transaction."
 *In re Kollar,* 286 F.3d 1326, 1332, 62 USPQ2d 1425, 1429
 (Fed. Cir. 2002). However, sale of a product made by the claimed process by the
 patentee or a licensee would constitute a sale of the process within the meaning
 of **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See *id.* at 1333, 62 USPQ2d
 at 1429; *D.L. Auld Co. v. Chroma Graphics Corp.,* 714 F.2d 1144,
 1147-48, 219 USPQ 13, 15-16 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Even though the sale of a product
 made by a claimed method before the critical date did not reveal anything about
 the method to the public, the sale resulted in a "forfeiture" of any right to a
 patent to that method); *W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc. v. Garlock,
 Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 1550, 220 USPQ 303, 310 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The
 application of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** would also be triggered by
 actually performing the claimed process itself for consideration. See
 *Scaltech, Inc. v. Retec/Tetra, L.L.C.,* 269 F.3d 1321, 1328,
 60 USPQ2d 1687, 1691(Fed. Cir. 2001) (Patent was held invalid under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** based on patentee’s offer to perform the
 claimed process for treating oil refinery waste more than one year before filing
 the patent application). Moreover, the sale of a device embodying a claimed
 process may trigger the on-sale bar. *Minton v. National Ass’n. of
 Securities Dealers, Inc.,* 336 F.3d 1373, 1378, 67 USPQ2d 1614, 1618
 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (finding a fully operational computer program implementing and
 thus embodying the claimed method to trigger the on-sale bar). However, the sale
 of a prior art device different from that disclosed in a patent that is asserted
 after the critical date to be capable of performing the claimed method is not an
 on-sale bar of the process. *Poly-America LP v. GSE Lining Tech.
 Inc.,* 383 F.3d 1303, 1308-09, 72 USPQ2d 1685, 1688-89 (Fed. Cir.
 2004) (stating that the transaction involving the sale of the prior art device did
 not involve a transaction of the claimed method but instead only a device
 different from that described in the patent for carrying out the claimed method,
 where the device was not used to practice the claimed method until well after the
 critical date, and where there was evidence that it was not even known whether the
 device could perform the claimed process).

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **not applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)

 **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


The language "in this country" in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** does not include other WTO or NAFTA member countries,
 but includes any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, and any
 commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. See also
 **[35 U.S.C.
 105](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302614)**. For purposes of judging the applicability of the
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bars, public use or on sale activity must take
 place in the United States. The "on sale" bar does not generally apply where both
 manufacture and delivery occur in a foreign country. *Gandy v. Main Belting
 Co.,* 143 U.S. 587, 593 (1892). However, "on sale" status can be found if
 substantial activity prefatory to a "sale" occurs in the United States.
 *Robbins Co. v. Lawrence Mfg. Co.,* 482 F.2d 426, 433, 178 USPQ
 577, 583 (9th Cir. 1973). An offer for sale, made or originating in this country, may
 be sufficient prefatory activity to bring the offer within the terms of the statute,
 even though sale and delivery take place in a foreign country. The same rationale
 applies to an offer by a foreign manufacturer which is communicated to a prospective
 purchaser in the United States prior to the critical date. *CTS Corp. v.
 Piher Int’l Corp.,* 593 F.2d 777, 201 USPQ 649 (7th Cir. 1979).
 




# 2133.03(e) Permitted Activity; Experimental Use [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to
 those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)** for

 **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


The question posed by the experimental use doctrine is "whether the
 primary purpose of the inventor at the time of the sale, as determined from an
 objective evaluation of the facts surrounding the transaction, was to conduct
 experimentation." *Allen Eng’g Corp. v. Bartell Indus., Inc.,* 299
 F.3d 1336, 1354, 63 USPQ2d 1769, 1780 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting *EZ Dock v.
 Schafer Sys., Inc.,* 276 F.3d 1347, 1356-57, 61 USPQ2d 1289, 1295-96
 (Fed. Cir. 2002)) (Linn, J., concurring). Experimentation must be the primary purpose
 and any commercial exploitation must be incidental in order for the sale to be a
 permitted activity that does not create a bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. 
 


If the use or sale was experimental, there is no bar under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. "A use or sale is experimental for purposes of
 **[[pre-AIA]
 section 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** if it represents a *bona fide*
 effort to perfect the invention or to ascertain whether it will answer its intended
 purpose.… If any commercial exploitation does occur, it must be merely incidental to
 the primary purpose of the experimentation to perfect the invention."

# 2133.03(e)(1) Commercial Exploitation [R-08.2017]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject
 to those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)**
 for a detailed discussion of the public use and on sale provisions of
 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


One policy of the on sale and public use bars is the prevention
 of inventors from exploiting their inventions commercially more than 1 year prior
 to the filing of a patent application. Therefore, if applicant’s precritical date
 activity is a sale or offer for sale that is an attempt at market penetration, a
 patent is barred. Thus, even if there is *bona fide* experimental
 activity, an inventor may not commercially exploit an invention more than 1 year
 prior to the filing date of an application. *In re Theis,* 610
 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA 1979).
 

**I.** **THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY MUST LEGITIMATELY ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
 INVENTION TOWARDS COMPLETION**As the degree of commercial exploitation surrounding
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** activity increases, the burden on an
 applicant to establish clear and convincing evidence of experimental activity
 with respect to a public use becomes more difficult. Where the examiner has
 found a *prima facie* case of a sale or an offer to sell, this
 burden will rarely be met unless clear and convincing necessity for the
 experimentation is established by the applicant. This does not mean, of course,
 that there are no circumstances which would permit alleged experimental
 activity in an atmosphere of commercial exploitation. In certain circumstances,
 even a sale may be necessary to legitimately advance the experimental
 development of an invention if the primary purpose of the sale is experimental.
 *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA
 1979); *Robbins Co. v. Lawrence Mfg. Co.,* 482 F.2d 426, 433,
 178 USPQ 577, 582 (9th Cir. 1973). However, careful scrutiny by the examiner of
 the objective factual circumstances surrounding such a sale is essential. See
 *Ushakoff v. United States,* 327 F.2d 669, 140 USPQ 341
 (Ct.Cl. 1964); *Cloud v. Standard Packaging Corp.,* 376 F.2d
 384, 153 USPQ 317 (7th Cir. 1967). 
 

**II.** **SIGNIFICANT FACTORS INDICATIVE OF "COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION"**As discussed in **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**, a policy
 consideration in questions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 activity is premature "commercial exploitation" of a "completed" or "ready for
 patenting" invention (see **[MPEP § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)**). The extent
 of commercial activity which constitutes **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 "on sale" status depends upon the circumstances of the activity, the basic
 indicator being the subjective intent of the inventor as manifested through
 objective evidence. The following activities should be used by the examiner as
 indicia of this subjective intent:
 


* (A) Preparation of various contemporaneous "commercial"
 documents, e.g., orders, invoices, receipts, delivery schedules, etc.;
* (B) Preparation of price lists *(Akron
 Brass**Co.**v. Elkhart Brass Mfg. Co.,* 353 F.2d 704, 709, 147 USPQ

"When sales are made in an ordinary commercial environment and
 the goods are placed outside the inventor’s control, an inventor’s secretly held
 subjective intent to ‘experiment,’ even if true, is unavailing without objective
 evidence to support the contention. Under such circumstances, the customer at a
 minimum must be made aware of the experimentation." *LaBounty Mfg., Inc.

# 2133.03(e)(3) "Completeness" of the Invention [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**I.** **EXPERIMENTAL USE ENDS WHEN THE INVENTION IS ACTUALLY REDUCED TO
 PRACTICE**Experimental use "means perfecting or completing an invention
 to the point of determining that it will work for its intended purpose."
 Therefore, experimental use "ends with an actual reduction to practice."
 *RCA Corp.**v.**Data Gen. Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1061, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1453
 (Fed. Cir. 1989). If the examiner concludes from the evidence of record that an
 applicant was satisfied that an invention was in fact "complete," awaiting
 approval by the applicant from an organization such as Underwriters’
 Laboratories will not normally overcome this conclusion. *Interroyal
 Corp. v. Simmons Co.,* 204 USPQ 562, 566 (S.D.N.Y. 1979);
 *Skil Corp. v. Rockwell Manufacturing Co.,* 358 F. Supp.
 1257, 1261, 178 USPQ 562, 565 (N.D.Ill. 1973), *aff’d. in part, rev’d
 in part sub nom.**Skil Corp. v. Lucerne Products Inc.,* 503 F.2d 745, 183 USPQ
 396, 399 (7th Cir. 1974), *cert. denied,* 420 U.S. 974, 185
 USPQ 65 (1975). See **[MPEP § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)** for more
 information of what constitutes a "complete" invention.
 


The fact that alleged experimental activity does not lead to
 specific modifications or refinements of an invention is evidence, although not
 conclusive evidence, that such activity is not within the realm permitted by
 the statute. This is especially the case where the evidence of record clearly
 demonstrates to the examiner that an invention was considered "complete" by an
 inventor at the time of the activity. Nevertheless, any modifications or
 refinements which did result from such experimental activity must at least be a
 feature of the claimed invention to be of any probative value. *In re
 Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA 1979).
 

**II.** **DISPOSAL OF PROTOTYPES**Where a prototype of an invention has been disposed of by an
 inventor before the critical date, inquiry by the examiner should focus upon
 the intent of the inventor and the reasonableness of the disposal under all
 circumstances. The fact that an otherwise reasonable disposal of a prototype
 involves incidental income is not necessarily fatal. *In re
 Dybel,* 524 F.2d 1393, 1399, n.5, 187 USPQ 593, 597 n.5 (CCPA
 1975). However, if a prototype is considered "complete" by an inventor and all
 experimentation on the underlying invention has ceased, unrestricted disposal
 of the prototype constitutes a bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *In re Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 113 USPQ 289 (CCPA 1957);

The courts have considered a number of factors in determining
 whether a claimed invention was the subject of a commercial offer for sale
 primarily for purposes of experimentation. "These factors include: (1) the
 necessity for public testing, (2) the amount of control over the experiment
 retained by the inventor, (3) the nature of the invention, (4) the length of the
 test period, (5) whether payment was made, (6) whether there was a secrecy
 obligation, (7) whether records of the experiment were kept, (8) who conducted the
 experiment, ... (9) the degree of commercial exploitation during testing[,] ...
 (10) whether the invention reasonably requires evaluation under actual conditions
 of use, (11) whether testing was systematically performed, (12) whether the
 inventor continually monitored the invention during testing, and (13) the nature
 of contacts made with potential customers." *Allen Eng’g Corp. v. Bartell
 Indus., Inc.,* 299 F.3d 1336, 1353, 63 USPQ2d 1769, 1780 (Fed. Cir.
 2002) (quoting *EZ Dock v. Schafer Sys., Inc.,* 276 F.3d 1347,
 1357, 61 USPQ2d 1289, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2002)) (Linn, J., concurring). Another
 critical attribute of experimentation is the "customer’s awareness of the
 purported testing in the context of a sale." *Electromotive Div. of Gen.
 Motors Corp. v. Transportation Sys. Div. of Gen. Elec. Co.,* 417 F.3d
 1203, 1241, 75 USPQ2d 1650, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
 


Once alleged experimental activity is advanced by an applicant to
 explain a *prima facie* case under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the examiner must determine whether the scope and
 length of the activity were reasonable in terms of the experimental purpose
 intended by the applicant and the nature of the subject matter involved. No one
 of, or particular combination of, factors is necessarily determinative of this
 purpose.

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**THE INVENTOR MUST MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER THE INVENTION DURING
 TESTING BY THIRD PARTIES**The significant determinative factors in questions of
 experimental purpose are the extent of supervision and control maintained by an
 inventor over an invention during an alleged period of experimentation , and
 the customer’s awareness of the experimentation. *Electromotive Div. of
 Gen. Motors Corp. v. Transportation Sys. Div. of Gen. Elec. Co.,*
 417 F.3d 1203, 1214,75 USPQ2d 1650, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2005)("control and customer
 awareness ordinarily must be proven if experimentation is to be found"). Once a
 period of experimental activity has ended and supervision and control has been
 relinquished by an inventor without any restraints on subsequent use of an
 invention, an unrestricted subsequent use of the invention is a
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bar. *In re Blaisdell,*

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §

 to those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)**
 for a detailed discussion of the public use and on sale provisions of
 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**I.** **DEVELOPMENTAL TESTING IS PERMITTED**Testing of an invention in the normal context of its
 technological development is generally within the realm of permitted
 experimental activity. Likewise, experimentation to determine utility, as that
 term is applied in **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, may also
 constitute permissible activity. See *General Motors Corp. v. Bendix
 Aviation Corp.,* 123 F. Supp. 506, 521, 102 USPQ 58, 69 (N.D.Ind.
 1954). For example, where an invention relates to a chemical composition with
 no known utility, i.e., a patent application for the composition could not be
 filed (**[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**; **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph), continued testing to find
 utility would likely be permissible under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**,
 absent a sale of the composition or other evidence of commercial exploitation.
 
 

**II.** **MARKET TESTING IS NOT PERMITTED**Experimentation to determine product acceptance, i.e., market
 testing, is typical of a trader’s and not an inventor’s experiment and is thus
 not within the area of permitted experimental activity. *Smith &
 Davis Mfg. Co. v. Mellon,* 58 F. 705, 707 (8th Cir. 1893) Likewise,
 testing of an invention for the benefit of appeasing a customer, or to conduct
 "minor ‘tune up’ procedures not requiring an inventor’s skills, but rather the
 skills of a competent technician," are also not within the exception.
 *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 193-94
 (CCPA 1979).
 

**III.** **EXPERIMENTAL ACTIVITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DESIGN APPLICATIONS**The public use of an ornamental design which is directed
 toward generating consumer interest in the aesthetics of the design is not an
 experimental use. *In re Mann,* 861 F.2d 1581, 8 USPQ2d 2030
 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (display of a wrought iron table at a trade show held to be
 public use). However, "experimentation directed to functional features of a
 product also containing an ornamental design may negate what otherwise would be
 considered a public use within the meaning of **[section
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**." *Tone Brothers, Inc.**v.**Sysco Corp.,* 28 F.3d 1192, 1196, 31 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed.
 Cir. 1994) (A study wherein students evaluated the effect of the functional
 features of a spice container design may be considered an experimental
 use.).

**EXPERIMENTAL USE EXCEPTION IS PERSONAL TO AN APPLICANT**The statutory bars of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 are applicable even though public use or on sale activity is by a party other
 than an applicant. Where an applicant presents evidence of experimental
 activity by such other party, the evidence will not overcome the *prima
 facie* case under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 based upon the activity of such party unless the activity was under the
 supervision and control of the applicant. *In re Hamilton,*
 882 F.2d 1576, 1581, 111 USPQ2d 1890, 1894 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("The experimental
 use doctrine operates in the inventor's favor to allow *the
 inventor* to refine his invention or to assess its value relative
 to the time and expense of prosecuting a patent application. If it is not the
 inventor or someone under his control or ‘surveillance’ who does these things,
 there appears to us no reason why he should be entitled to rely upon them to
 avoid the statute.") (citing *Magnetics, Inc. v. Arnold Engineering
 Co.,* 438 F.2d 72, 74, 168 USPQ 392, 394 (7th Cir.1971)). In other
 words, the experimental use activity exception is personal to an applicant.

# 2133.01 Rejections of Continuation-In-Part (CIP) Applications [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **not applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA
 as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to
 those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_18e23_3ce)** et seq. for a detailed
 discussion of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) and
 (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


The effective filing date of a claimed invention is determined on a
 claim-by-claim basis and not an application-by-application basis. See
 **[MPEP §
 2139.01](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_12530_2b6)** for guidance in determining the effective filing date
 of a claimed invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 


When applicant files a continuation-in-part application,
 none of whose claims are supported by the parent application under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, the effective filing date is the filing date
 of the child CIP. Any prior art disclosing the invention or an obvious variant thereof
 having a critical reference date more than 1 year prior to the filing date of the child
 will bar the issuance of a patent under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. *Paperless Accounting v. Bay Area Rapid Transit System,* 804 F.2d 659, 665,
 231 USPQ 649, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1986). 
 


Any claim that only contains subject matter that is
 fully supported in compliance with the statutory requirements of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, by the parent application of a CIP will have
 the effective filing date of the parent application. On the other hand, any claim that
 contains a limitation that is only supported as required by **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, by the disclosure of the CIP application
 will have the effective filing date of the CIP application. See, e.g.,*Santarus, Inc. v. Par Pharmaceutical, Inc.,* 694 F.3d 1344, 104 USPQ2d 1641
 (Fed. Cir. 2012)(patent issuing from parent application was relied upon as prior art
 against the claims in CIPs that did not find support in the parent application);
 *Studiengesellschaft Kohle, m.b.H. v. Shell Oil Co.,* 112 F.3d 1561,
 1564, 42 USPQ2d 1674 (Fed. Cir. 1997)("To qualify for an earlier filing date, section
 120 requires, *inter alia,* that the earlier-filed U.S. patent
 application contain a disclosure which complies with **[35 U.S.C. § 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, p 1 (1994) for each
 claim in the newly filed application. Thus, this benefit only applies to claims that
 recite subject matter adequately described in an earlier application, and does not
 extend to claims with subject matter outside the description in the earlier
 application.").

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to
 those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)** for a
 detailed discussion of the public use and on sale provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


An applicant may make an admission, or submit evidence of
 sale of the invention or knowledge of the invention by others, or the examiner may have
 personal knowledge that the invention was sold by applicant or known by others. If the
 activity is by an entity other than the inventors or assignee, such as sale by another,
 manufacture by another or disclosure of the invention by the inventor or assignee to
 another then both **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** may be applicable. If the
 evidence only points to knowledge within the year prior to the effective filing date
 then **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** applies. However, no rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** should be made if there is evidence that applicant made the
 invention and only disclosed it to others within the year prior to the effective filing
 date. **[Pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is applicable if the activity occurred more than 1
 year prior to the effective filing date of the application.
 


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** "contains several distinct bars to patentability, each of
 which relates to activity or disclosure more than one year prior to the date of the
 application. Two of these - the ‘public use’ and the ‘on sale’ objections - are
 sometimes considered together although it is quite clear that either may apply when the
 other does not." *Dart Indus. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.,*
 489 F.2d 1359, 1365, 179 USPQ 392, 396 (7th Cir. 1973). There may be a public use of an
 invention absent any sales activity. Likewise, there may be a nonpublic, e.g., "secret,"
 sale or offer to sell an invention which nevertheless constitutes a statutory bar.
 *Hobbs v.**United States,* 451 F.2d 849, 859-60, 171 USPQ 713, 720 (5th Cir.
 1971).
 


In similar fashion, not all "public use" and "on sale" activities will
 necessarily occasion the identical result. Although both activities affect how an
 inventor may use an invention prior to the filing of a patent application,
 "non-commercial" **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** activity may not be viewed the same as
 similar "commercial" activity. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)** and
 **[§ 2133.03(e)(1)](s2133.html#d0e204712)**. Likewise, "public use" activity by
 an applicant may not be considered in the same light as similar "public use" activity by
 one other than  an applicant. See **[MPEP § 2133.03(a)](s2133.html#d0e203899)** and
 **[§ 2133.03(e)(7)](s2133.html#d0e205133)**. Additionally, the concept of "experimental
 use" may have different significance in "commercial" and "non-commercial" environments.
 See **[MPEP
 § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)** and **[§ 2133.03(e)](s2133.html#d0e204670)** - **[§ 2133.03(e)(6)](s2133.html#d0e205061)**. 
 


It should be noted that **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** may create
 a bar to patentability either alone, if the device in public use or placed on sale
 anticipates a later claimed invention, or in conjunction with **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, if
 the claimed invention would have been obvious from the device in conjunction with the
 prior art. *LaBounty Mfg.**v.**United States Int’l Trade Comm’n,* 958 F.2d 1066, 1071, 22 USPQ2d
 1025, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
 

 **POLICY CONSIDERATIONS*** (A) "One policy underlying the [on-sale] bar is to obtain
 widespread disclosure of new inventions to the public via patents as soon as
 possible." *RCA Corp*. *v. Data Gen. Corp.,*
 887 F.2d 1056, 1062, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1454 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
* (B) Another policy underlying the public use and on-sale bars is
 to prevent the inventor from commercially exploiting the exclusivity of his [or
 her] invention substantially beyond the statutorily authorized period.
 *RCA Corp.**v.**Data Gen. Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1062, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1454
 (Fed. Cir. 1989). See **[MPEP § 2133.03(e)(1)](s2133.html#d0e204712)**.
* (C) Another underlying policy for the public use and on-sale bars
 is to discourage "the removal of inventions from the public domain which the
 public justifiably comes to believe are freely available." *Manville
 Sales**Corp. v. Paramount Sys., Inc.,* 917 F.2d 544, 549, 16 USPQ2d

**I.** **TEST FOR "PUBLIC USE** The public use bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 arises where the invention is in public use before the critical date and is ready
 for patenting. *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing L.P.,*
 424 F.3d 1374, 76 USPQ2d 1741 (Fed. Cir. 2005). As explained by the court,

>  The proper test for the public use prong of the

*Id.* at 1380, 76 USPQ2d at 1744 (citations omitted). See
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e203781)** for a discussion of the "ready for patenting"
 prong of the public use and on sale statutory bars.
 


"[T]o constitute the public use of an invention it is not
 necessary that more than one of the patent articles should be publicly used. The
 use of a great number may tend to strengthen the proof, but one well defined case
 of such use is just as effectual to annul the patent as many." Likewise, it is not
 necessary that more than one person use the invention. *Egbert
 v.**Lippmann,* 104 U.S. 333, 336 (1881).
 

**II.** **PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE IS NOT NECESSARILY PUBLIC USE UNDER Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)**Mere knowledge of the invention by the public does not warrant
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bars public use or sale, not public knowledge.
 *TP**Labs., Inc. v. Professional Positioners, Inc.,* 724 F.2d 965,
 970, 220 USPQ 577, 581 (Fed. Cir. 1984).
 


Note, however, that public knowledge may provide grounds for
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[MPEP § 2132](s2132.html#d0e203390)**. 
 

***A.*** ***Commercial Versus Noncommercial Use and the Impact of
 Secrecy***There are limited circumstances in which a secret or
 confidential use of an invention may give rise to the public use bar.
 "[S]ecrecy of use alone is not sufficient to show that existing knowledge has
 not been withdrawn from public use; commercial exploitation is also forbidden."
 *Invitrogen,* 424 F.3d at 1382, 76 USPQ2d at 1745-46 (The
 fact that patentee secretly used the claimed invention internally before the
 critical date to develop future products that were never sold was by itself
 insufficient to create a public use bar to patentability.).
 

**1.** **"Public Use" and "Non-secret Use" Are Not Necessarily
 Synonymous**"Public" is not necessarily synonymous with "non- secret."
 The fact "that non-secret uses of the device were made [by the inventor or
 someone connected with the inventor] prior to the critical date is not
 itself dispositive of the issue of whether activity barring a patent under
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** occurred. The fact that the device
 was not hidden from view may make the use not secret, but nonsecret use is
 not *ipso facto* ‘public use’ activity. Nor, it must be
 added, is all secret use *ipso facto* not ‘public use’
 within the meaning of the statute," if the inventor is making commercial use
 of the invention under circumstances which preserve its secrecy. *TP
 Labs., Inc.**v.**Professional Positioners, Inc.,* 724 F.2d 965, 972, 220
 USPQ 577, 583 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (citations omitted). 
 

**2.** **Even If the Invention Is Hidden, Inventor Who Puts Machine or Article
 Embodying the Invention in Public View Is Barred from Obtaining a Patent
 as the Invention Is in Public Use** When the inventor or someone connected to the inventor puts
 the invention on display or sells it, there is a "public use" within the
 meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** even though by its very
 nature an invention is completely hidden from view as part of a larger
 machine or article, if the invention is otherwise used in its natural and
 intended way and the larger machine or article is accessible to the public.
 *In re Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 783, 113 USPQ 289, 292
 (CCPA 1957); *Hall**v. Macneale,* 107 U.S. 90, 96-97 (1882); *Ex
 parte**Kuklo,* 25 USPQ2d 1387, 1390 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992) (Display of equipment including the structural features of the claimed
 invention to visitors of laboratory is public use even though public did not
 see inner workings of device. The person to whom the invention is publicly
 disclosed need not understand the significance and technical complexities of
 the invention.).
 

**3.** **There Is No Public Use If Inventor Restricted Use to Locations Where
 There Was a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy and the Use Was for His or
 Her Own Enjoyment** An inventor’s private use of the invention, for his or her
 own enjoyment is not a public use. *Moleculon Research
 Corp.**v. CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809
 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Inventor showed inventive puzzle to close friends while in
 his dorm room and later the president of the company at which he was working
 saw the puzzle on the inventor’s desk and they discussed it. Court held that
 the inventor retained control and thus these actions did not result in a
 "public use.").
 

**4.** **The Presence or Absence of a Confidentiality Agreement is Not
 Dispositive of the Public Use Issue**"The presence or absence of a confidentiality agreement is
 not dispositive of the public use issue, but ‘is one factor to be considered
 in assessing all the evidence.’" *Bernhardt, L.L.C. v. Collezione
 Europa USA, Inc.,* 386 F.3d 1371, 1380-81, 72 USPQ2d 1901, 1909
 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting *Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS
 Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1266, 229 USPQ 805, 808 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).
 The court stressed that it is necessary to analyze the evidence of public
 use in the context of policies that underlie the public use and on sale bar
 that include "‘discouraging removal of inventions from the public domain
 that the public justifiably believes are freely available, prohibiting an
 extension of the period for exploiting an invention, and favoring prompt and
 widespread disclosure of inventions.’" *Bernhardt,* 386
 F.3d at 1381, 72 USPQ2d at 1909. See also *Invitrogen,* 424
 F.3d at 1379, 76 USPQ2d at 1744; **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**, subsection
 I. Evidence that the court emphasized included the "‘nature of the activity
 that occurred in public; the public access to and knowledge of the public
 use; [and] whether there were any confidentiality obligations imposed on
 persons who observed the use.’" *Bernhardt,* 386 F.3d at
 1381, 72 USPQ2d at 1909. For example, the court in
 *Bernhardt* noted that an exhibition display at issue in
 the case "was not open to the public, that the identification of attendees
 was checked against a list of authorized names by building security and
 later at a reception desk near the showroom, that attendees were escorted
 through the showroom, and that the attendees were not permitted to make
 written notes or take photographs inside the showroom."
 *Id.* The court remanded the issue of whether the
 exhibition display was a public use for further proceedings since the
 district court "focused on the absence of any confidentiality agreements and
 did not discuss or analyze how the totality of the circumstances
 surrounding" the exhibition "comports with the policies underlying the
 public use bar." *Id.*

***B.*** ***Use by Third Parties Deriving the Invention from
 Applicant**** 

**An Invention Is in Public Use If the Inventor Allows Another To Use
 the Invention Without Restriction or Obligation of Secrecy**"Public use" of a claimed invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** occurs when the inventor allows another person
 to use the invention without limitation, restriction or obligation of
 secrecy to the inventor."  *In re Smith,* 714 F.2d 1127,
 1134, 218 USPQ 976, 983 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The presence or absence of a
 confidentiality agreement is not itself determinative of the public use
 issue, but is one factor to be considered along with the time, place, and
 circumstances of the use which show the amount of control the inventor
 retained over the invention. *Moleculon Research Corp.**v. CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809
 (Fed. Cir. 1986). See *Ex parte C,* 27 USPQ2d 1492, 1499
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (Inventor sold inventive soybean seeds to
 growers who contracted and were paid to plant the seeds to increase stock
 for later sale. The commercial nature of the use of the seed coupled with
 the "on-sale" aspects of the contract and apparent lack of confidentiality
 requirements rose to the level of a "public use" bar.); *Egbert
 v.**Lippmann,* 104 U.S. 333, 336 (1881) (Public use found
 where inventor allowed another to use inventive corset insert, though hidden
 from view during use, because he did not impose an obligation of secrecy or
 restrictions on its use.). 
 

***C.*** ***Use by Independent Third Parties**** 

Use by an Independent Third Party Is Public Use If
 It Sufficiently "Informs" the Public of the Invention or a Competitor Could
 Reasonably Ascertain the Invention
 Any "nonsecret" use of an invention by someone unconnected
 to the inventor, such as someone who has independently made the invention,
 in the ordinary course of a business for trade or profit may be a "public
 use," *Bird Provision Co. v. Owens Country Sausage,**Inc.,* 568 F.2d 369, 374-76, 197 USPQ 134, 138-40 (5th
 Cir. 1978). Additionally, even a "secret" use by another inventor of a
 machine or process to make a product is "public" if the details of the
 machine or process are ascertainable by inspection or analysis of the
 product that is sold or publicly displayed. *Gillman v.
 Stern,* 114 F.2d 28, 46 USPQ 430 (2d Cir. 1940); *Dunlop
 Holdings, Ltd. v. Ram Golf Corp.,* 524 F.2d 33, 36-7, 188 USPQ
 481, 483-484 (7th Cir. 1975). If the details of an inventive process are not
 ascertainable from the product sold or displayed and the third party has
 kept the invention as a trade secret then that use is not a public use and
 will not bar a patent issuing to someone unconnected to the user.
 *W.L. Gore & Assocs. v. Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d
 1540, 1550, 220 USPQ 303, 310 (Fed. Cir. 1983). However, a device qualifies
 as prior art if it places the claimed features in the
 public's possession before the critical date even if other
 unclaimed aspects of the device were not publicly
 available. *Lockwood v. American Airlines, Inc.,* 107 F.3d
 1505, 1570-71, 41 USPQ2d 1961, 1964-65 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Computer
 reservation system was prior art even though "essential algorithms of the
 SABRE software were proprietary and confidential and...those aspects of the
 system that were readily apparent to the public would not have been
 sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to duplicate the [unclaimed
 aspects of the] system."). The extent that the public becomes "informed" of
 an invention involved in public use activity by one other than an applicant
 depends upon the factual circumstances surrounding the activity and how
 these comport with the policies underlying the on sale and public use bars.
 *Manville Sales Corp. v. Paramount Sys., Inc*., 917 F.2d
 544, 549, 16 USPQ2d 1587, 1591 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (quoting *King
 Instrument Corp.**v. Otari Corp.,* 767 F.2d 833, 860, 226 USPQ 402, 406
 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). By way of example, in an allegedly "secret" use by a
 third party other than an applicant, if a large number of employees of such
 a party, who are not under a promise of secrecy, are permitted unimpeded
 access to an invention, with affirmative steps by the party to educate other
 employees as to the nature of the invention, the public is "informed."
 *Chemithon Corp.**v.**Proctor & Gamble Co.,* 287 F. Supp. 291, 308, 159 USPQ
 139, 154 (D.Md. 1968), *aff’d.,* 427 F.2d 893, 165 USPQ 678
 (4th Cir. 1970).
 


Even if public use activity by one other than an applicant
 is not sufficiently "informing," there may be adequate grounds upon which to
 base a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See  *Dunlop
 Holdings Ltd. v. Ram Golf Corp.,* 524 F.2d 33, 188 USPQ 481 (7th
 Cir. 1975). See **[MPEP § 2137](s2137.html#d0e206570)** and

# 2133.03(b) "On Sale" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** . See

 **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


An impermissible sale has occurred if there was a definite sale, or
 offer to sell, more than 1 year before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention and the subject matter of the sale, or offer to sell, fully anticipated the
 claimed invention or would have rendered the claimed invention obvious by its
 addition to the prior art. *Ferag AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45 F.3d 1562,
 1565, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1514 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The on-sale bar of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is triggered if the invention is both (1) the subject of
 a commercial offer for sale not primarily for experimental purposes and (2) ready for
 patenting. *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48 USPQ2d
 1641, 1646-47 (1998). Traditional contract law principles are applied when
 determining whether a commercial offer for sale has occurred. See *Linear
 Tech. Corp. v. Micrel, Inc.,* 275 F.3d 1040, 1048, 61 USPQ2d 1225, 1229
 (Fed. Cir. 2001), *petition for cert. filed,* 71 USLW 3093 (July 03,
 2002) (No. 02-39); *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc.,* 254
 F.3d 1041,1047, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("As a general proposition, we
 will look to the Uniform Commercial Code (‘UCC’) to define whether … a communication
 or series of communications rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale.").
 

**I.** **THE MEANING OF "SALE"**A sale is a contract between parties wherein the seller agrees
 "to give and to pass rights of property" in return for the buyer’s payment or
 promise "to pay the seller for the things bought or sold." *In re
 Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 676, 226 USPQ 1, 4 (Fed. Cir. 1985). A
 contract for the sale of goods requires a concrete offer and acceptance of that
 offer. See, e.g., *Linear Tech.,* 275 F.3d at 1052-54, 61 USPQ2d
 at 1233-34 (Court held there was no sale within the meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** where prospective purchaser submitted an order for
 goods at issue, but received an order acknowledgement reading "will advise-not
 booked." Prospective purchaser would understand that order was not accepted.).
 


"[T]o be ‘on sale’ under **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, a
 product must be the subject of a commercial sale or offer for sale," and to be a
 commercial sale it must be "one that bears the general hallmarks of a sale
 pursuant to Section 2-106 of the Uniform Commercial Code." *Medicines Co.
 v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363, 1364 119 USPQ2d 1329, 1330 (Fed.
 Cir. 2016) (en banc). The court in *Medicines Co.* went on to
 explain "[s]ection 2-106(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code describes a ‘sale’ as
 ‘the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.’ U.C.C. §
 2-106(1). The passage of title is a helpful indicator of whether a product is ‘on
 sale,’ as it suggests when the inventor gives up its interest and control over the
 product." *Id.* at 1375, 119 USPQ2d at 1338. The
 *Medicines Co.* court held "a contract manufacturer’s sale to
 the inventor of manufacturing services where neither title to the embodiments nor
 the right to market the same passes to the supplier does not constitute an
 invalidating sale under **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**."
 *Id.* at 1381, 119 USPQ2d at 1342.
 

***A.******Conditional Sale May Bar a Patent***An invention may be deemed to be "on sale" even though the
 sale was conditional. The fact that the sale is conditioned on buyer
 satisfaction does not, without more, prove that the sale was for an
 experimental purpose. *Strong v. General Elec. Co.,* 434 F.2d
 1042, 1046, 168 USPQ 8, 12 (5th Cir. 1970).
 

***B.******Nonprofit Sale May Bar a Patent***A "sale" need not be for profit to bar a patent. If the sale
 was for the commercial exploitation of the invention, it is "on sale" within
 the meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *In re Dybel,* 524 F.2d 1393, 1401, 187 USPQ 593, 599 (CCPA
 1975) ("Although selling the devices for a profit would have demonstrated the
 purpose of commercial exploitation, the fact that appellant realized no profit
 from the sales does not demonstrate the contrary.").
 

***C.******A Single Sale or Offer To Sell May Bar a Patent***Even a single sale or offer to sell the invention may bar
 patentability under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *Consolidated**Fruit-Jar Co. v. Wright,* 94 U.S. 92, 94 (1876);

***D.******A Sale of Rights Is Not a Sale of the Invention and Will Not in
 Itself Bar a Patent***"[A]n assignment or sale of the rights in the invention and
 potential patent rights is not a sale of ‘the invention’ within the meaning of
 **[[pre-AIA]
 section 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**." *Moleculon Research Corp. v.

 1986); see also *Elan Corp., PLC v. Andrx Pharms. Inc.,*
 366 F.3d 1336, 1341, 70 USPQ2d 1722, 1728 (Fed. Cir. 2004); *In re
 Kollar,* 286 F.3d 1326, 1330 n.3, 1330-1331, 62 USPQ2d 1425, 1428
 n.3, 1428-1429 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (distinguishing licenses which trigger the
 on-sale bar (e.g., a standard computer software license wherein the product is
 just as immediately transferred to the licensee as if it were sold), from
 licenses that merely grant rights to an invention which do not *per
 se* trigger the on-sale bar (e.g., exclusive rights to market the
 invention or potential patent rights)); *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark
 Cards, Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041, 1049 n. 2, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1129 n. 2
 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
 


"[T]he mere sale of manufacturing services by a
 contract manufacturer to an inventor to create embodiments of a patented
 product for the inventor does not constitute a ‘commercial sale’ of the
 invention." *Medicines Co. v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363,
 1373 119 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (*en banc*). The
 court in *Medicines Co.* further stated that "commercial
 benefit—even to both parties in a transaction—is not enough to trigger the
 on-sale bar of **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**; the transaction
 must be one in which the product is ‘on sale’ in the sense that it is
 ‘commercially marketed.’" *Id.* at 1373-74, 119 USPQ2d at
 1336-37.
 

***E.******Buyer Must Be Uncontrolled by the Seller or Offerer***A sale or offer for sale must take place between separate
 entities. *In re Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 676, 226 USPQ 1, 4
 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Where the parties to the alleged sale are related, whether
 there is a statutory bar depends on whether the seller so controls the
 purchaser that the invention remains out of the public’s hands. *Ferag
 AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45 F.3d 1562, 1566, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1515 (Fed.
 Cir. 1995) (Where the seller is a parent company of the buyer company, but the
 President of the buyer company had "essentially unfettered" management
 authority over the operations of the buyer company, the sale was a statutory
 bar.).
 

**II.** **OFFERS FOR SALE**"Only an offer which rises to the level of a commercial offer for
 sale, one which the other party could make into a binding contract by simple
 acceptance (assuming consideration), constitutes an offer for sale under
 **[§102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**." *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards,
 Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041,1048, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 
 

***A.******Rejected or Unreceived Offer for Sale Is Enough To Bar a
 Patent***Since the statute creates a bar when an invention is placed
 "on sale," a mere offer to sell is sufficient commercial activity to bar a
 patent. *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 791, 204 USPQ 188, 192
 (CCPA 1979). Even a rejected offer may create an on sale bar. *UMC
 Elecs. v. United States,* 816 F.2d 647, 653, 2 USPQ2d 1465, 1469
 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In fact, the offer need not even be actually received by a
 prospective purchaser. *Wende v. Horine,* 225 F. 501 (7th Cir.
 1915). 
 

***B.******Delivery of the Offered Item Is Not Required***"It is not necessary that a sale be consummated for the bar to
 operate." *Buildex v. Kason Indus.,**Inc.,* 849 F.2d 1461, 1463-64, 7 USPQ2d 1325, 1327-28 (Fed.
 Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). See also *Weatherchem Corp. v. J.L.
 Clark, Inc.,* 163 F.3d 1326, 1333, 49 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-07 (Fed.
 Cir. 1998) (A signed purchase agreement prior to the critical date constituted
 a commercial offer; it was immaterial that there was no delivery of later
 patented caps and no exchange of money until after critical date.).
 

***C.******Seller Need Not Have the Goods "On Hand" When the Offer for Sale Is
 Made***Goods need not be "on hand" and transferred at the time of the
 sale or offer. The date of the offer for sale is the effective date of the "on
 sale" activity. *J. A. La Porte, Inc. v. Norfolk Dredging
 Co.,* 787 F.2d 1577, 1582, 229 USPQ 435, 438 (Fed. Cir. 1986).
 However, the invention must be complete and "ready for patenting" (see
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)**) before the critical date. *Pfaff
 v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647
 (1998). See also *Micro Chemical, Inc. v. Great Plains Chemical
 Co.,* 103 F.3d 1538, 1545, 41 USPQ2d 1238, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1997)
 (The on-sale bar was not triggered by an offer to sell because the inventor
 "was not close to completion of the invention at the time of the alleged offer
 and had not demonstrated a high likelihood that the invention would work for
 its intended purpose upon completion."); *Shatterproof Glass Corp. v.
 Libbey-Owens Ford Co.,* 758 F.2d 613, 225 USPQ 634 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (Where there was no evidence that the samples shown to the potential customers
 were made by the new process and apparatus, the offer to sell did not rise to
 the level of an on sale bar.). Compare *Barmag Barmer Maschinenfabrik
 AG v. Murata Mach., Ltd.,* 731 F.2d 831, 221 USPQ 561 (Fed. Cir.
 1984) (Where a "make shift" model of the inventive product was shown to the
 potential purchasers in conjunction with the offer to sell, the offer was
 enough to bar a patent under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.).
 
 

***D.******Material Terms of an Offer for Sale Must be Present***"[A] communication that fails to constitute a definite offer
 to sell the product and to include material terms is not an ‘offer’ in the
 contract sense." *Elan Corp., PLC v. Andrx Pharms. Inc.,* 366
 F.3d 1336, 1341, 70 USPQ2d 1722, 1728 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court stated that
 an "offer to enter into a license under a patent for future sale of the
 invention covered by the patent when and if it has been developed... is not an
 offer to sell the patented invention that constitutes an on-sale bar."
 *Id.,* 70 USPQ2d at 1726. Accordingly, the court concluded
 that Elan’s letter was not an offer to sell a product. In addition, the court
 stated that the letter lacked material terms of a commercial offer such as
 pricing for the product, quantities, time and place of delivery, and product
 specifications and that the dollar amount in the letter was not a price term
 for the sale of the product but rather the amount requested was to form and
 continue a partnership, explicitly referred to as a "licensing fee."
 *Id.*

**III.** **SALE BY INVENTOR, ASSIGNEE OR OTHERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVENTOR IN THE
 COURSE OF BUSINESS*****A.******Sale Activity Need Not Be Public***Unlike questions of public use, there is no requirement that
 "on sale" activity be "public." "Public" as used in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** modifies "use" only. "Public" does not modify
 "sale." *Hobbs v. United States,* 451 F.2d 849, 171 USPQ 713,
 720 (5th Cir. 1971). 
 

***B.******Inventor’s Consent to the Sale Is Not a Prerequisite To Finding an
 On Sale Bar***If the invention was placed on sale by a third party who
 obtained the invention from the inventor, a patent is barred even if the
 inventor did not consent to the sale or have knowledge that the invention was
 embodied in the sold article. *Electric Storage Battery Co. v.
 Shimadzu,* 307 U.S. 5, 41 USPQ 155 (1938); *In re
 Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 783, 113 USPQ 289, 292 (CCPA 1957);
 *CTS Corp. v. Electro Materials Corp. of America,* 469 F.
 Supp. 801, 819, 202 USPQ 22, 38 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). 
 

***C.******Objective Evidence of Sale or Offer To Sell Is Needed***In determining if a sale or offer to sell the claimed
 invention has occurred, a key question to ask is whether the inventor sold or
 offered for sale a product that embodies the invention claimed in the
 application. Objective evidence such as a description of the inventive product
 in the contract of sale or in another communication with the purchaser controls
 over an uncommunicated intent by the seller to deliver the inventive product
 under the contract for sale. *Ferag AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45
 F.3d 1562, 1567, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1516 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (On sale bar found where
 initial negotiations and agreement containing contract for sale neither clearly
 specified nor precluded use of the inventive design, but an order confirmation
 prior to the critical date did specify use of inventive design.). The purchaser
 need not have actual knowledge of the invention for it to be on sale. The
 determination of whether "the offered product is in fact the claimed invention
 may be established by any relevant evidence, such as memoranda, drawings,
 correspondence, and testimony of witnesses." *RCA Corp. v. Data Gen.
 Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1060, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 However, "what the purchaser reasonably believes the inventor to be offering is
 relevant to whether, on balance, the offer objectively may be said to be of the
 patented invention." *Envirotech Corp. v. Westech Eng’g,
 Inc.,* 904 F.2d 1571, 1576, 15 USPQ2d 1230, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
 (Where a proposal to supply a general contractor with a product did not mention
 a new design but, rather, referenced a prior art design, the uncommunicated
 intent of the supplier to supply the new design if awarded the contract did not
 constitute an "on sale" bar to a patent on the new design, even though the
 supplier’s bid reflected the lower cost of the new design.). 
 

**IV.** **SALES BY INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES*** 

***A.******Sales or Offers for Sale by Independent Third Parties Will Bar a
 Patent***Sale or offer for sale of the invention by an independent
 third party more than 1 year before the filing date of applicant’s patent will
 bar applicant from obtaining a patent. "An exception to this rule exists where
 a patented method is kept secret and remains secret after a sale of the
 unpatented product of the method. Such a sale prior to the critical date is a
 bar if engaged in by the patentee or patent applicant, but not if engaged in by
 another." *In re Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 675-76, 226 USPQ 1,
 3-4 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 

***B.******Nonprior Art Publications Can Be Used as Evidence of Sale Before
 the Critical Date***Abstracts identifying a product’s vendor containing
 information useful to potential buyers such as whom to contact, price terms,
 documentation, warranties, training and maintenance along with the date of
 product release or installation before the inventor’s critical date may provide
 sufficient evidence of prior sale by a third party to support a rejection based
 on **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. *In re
 Epstein,* 32 F.3d 1559, 31 USPQ2d 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Examiner's
 rejection was based on nonprior art published abstracts which disclosed
 software products meeting the claims. The abstracts specified software release
 dates and dates of first installation which were more than 1 year before
 applicant’s filing date.).

 **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*



#### *Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102   
 Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of right to
 patent.*


A person shall be entitled to a patent unless -


\*\*\*\*\*


* (b) the invention was…in public use or on sale in this
 country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent
 in the United States


\*\*\*\*\*


(Emphasis added).


**I.** **THE INVENTION MUST BE "READY FOR PATENTING"**In *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55,
 66-68, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647 (1998), the Supreme Court enunciated a two-prong test
 for determining whether an invention was "on sale" within the meaning of
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** even if it has not yet been reduced to
 practice. "[T]he on-sale bar applies when two conditions are satisfied before the
 critical date [more than one year before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention]. First, the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for
 sale…. Second, the invention must be ready for patenting." *Id.*
 at 67, 119 S.Ct. at 311-12, 48 USPQ2d at 1646-47. 
 


The Federal Circuit explained that the Supreme Court’s "ready for
 patenting" prong applies in the context of both the on sale and public use bars.
 *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing L.P.,* 424 F.3d
 1374, 1379, 76 USPQ2d 1741, 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("A bar under **[[pre-AIA] section
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** arises where, before the critical date, the invention
 is in public use and ready for patenting."). "Ready for patenting," the second
 prong of the *Pfaff* test, "may be satisfied in at least two
 ways: by proof of reduction to practice before the critical date; or by proof that
 prior to the critical date the inventor had prepared drawings or other
 descriptions of the invention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person
 skilled in the art to practice the invention." *Id.* at 67, 199
 S.Ct. at 311-12, 48 USPQ2d at 1647 (The patent was held invalid because the
 invention for a computer chip socket was "ready for patenting" when it was offered
 for sale more than one year prior to the application filing date. Even though the
 invention had not yet been reduced to practice, the manufacturer was able to
 produce the claimed computer chip sockets using the inventor’s detailed drawings
 and specifications, and those sockets contained all elements of invention claimed
 in the patent.). See also *Weatherchem Corp. v. J.L. Clark Inc.,*
 163 F.3d 1326, 1333, 49 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-07 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The invention was
 held "ready for patenting" since the detailed drawings of plastic dispensing caps
 offered for sale "contained each limitation of the claims and were sufficiently
 specific to enable person skilled in art to practice the invention".). 
 


If the invention was actually reduced to practice before being
 sold or offered for sale more than 1 year before filing of the application, a
 patent will be barred. *Vanmoor v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,* 201
 F.3d 1363, 1366-67, 53 USPQ2d 1377, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("Here the pre-critical
 date sales were of completed cartridges made to specifications that remained
 unchanged to the present day, showing that any invention embodied in the accused
 cartridges was reduced to practice before the critical date. The
 *Pfaff* ready for patenting condition is also satisfied
 because the specification drawings, available prior to the critical date, were
 actually used to produce the accused cartridges."); *In re
 Hamilton,* 882 F.2d 1576, 1580, 11 USPQ2d 1890, 1893 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 
 "If a product that is offered for sale
 inherently possesses each of the limitations of the claims, then the invention
 is on sale, whether or not the parties to the transaction recognize that the
 product possesses the claimed characteristics."
 
 
 *Abbott Laboratories v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,* 182 F.3d
 1315, 1319, 51 USPQ2d 1307, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Claim for a particular
 anhydrous crystalline form of a pharmaceutical compound was held invalid under the
 on-sale bar of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, even though the parties to the
 U.S. sales of the foreign manufactured compound did not know the identity of the
 particular crystalline form.); *STX LLC. v. Brine Inc.,* 211 F.3d
 588, 591, 54 USPQ2d 1347, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Claim for a lacrosse stick was
 held invalid under the on-sale bar despite the argument that it was not known at
 the time of sale whether the sticks possessed the recited "improved playing and
 handling characteristics." "Subjective qualities inherent in a product, such as
 ‘improved playing and handling’, cannot serve as an escape hatch to circumvent an
 on-sale bar."). Actual reduction to practice in the context of an on-sale bar
 issue usually requires testing under actual working conditions in such a way as to
 demonstrate the practical utility of an invention for its intended purpose beyond
 the probability of failure, unless by virtue of the very simplicity of an
 invention its practical operativeness is clear. *Field v.
 Knowles,* 183 F.2d 593, 601, 86 USPQ 373, 379 (CCPA 1950);
 *Steinberg v. Seitz,* 517 F.2d 1359, 1363, 186 USPQ 209, 212
 (CCPA 1975). 
 


The invention need not be ready for satisfactory commercial
 marketing for sale to bar a patent. *Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex
 Corp.,* 970 F.2d 834, 836-37, 23 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
 
 

**II.** **INVENTOR HAS SUBMITTED A 37 CFR 1.131 AFFIDAVIT OR DECLARATION**Affidavits or declarations submitted under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** to swear behind a reference may constitute, among
 other things, an admission that an invention was "complete" more than 1 year
 before the filing of an application. See *In re Foster,* 343 F.2d
 980, 987-88, 145 USPQ 166, 173 (CCPA 1965); *Dart Indus. v. E.I. duPont de
 Nemours & Co.,* 489 F.2d 1359, 1365, 179 USPQ 392, 396 (7th Cir.
 1973). Also see **[MPEP
 § 715.10](s715.html#d0e92043)**. 
 

**III.** **SALE OF A PROCESS**A claimed process, which is a series of acts or steps, is not
 sold in the same sense as is a claimed product, device, or apparatus, which is a
 tangible item. "‘Know-how’ describing what the process consists of and how the
 process should be carried out may be sold in the sense that the buyer acquires
 knowledge of the process and obtains the freedom to carry it out pursuant to the
 terms of the transaction. However, such a transaction is not a ‘sale’ of the
 invention within the meaning of **[[pre-AIA] §102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** because the
 process has not been carried out or performed as a result of the transaction."
 *In re Kollar,* 286 F.3d 1326, 1332, 62 USPQ2d 1425, 1429
 (Fed. Cir. 2002). However, sale of a product made by the claimed process by the
 patentee or a licensee would constitute a sale of the process within the meaning
 of **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See *id.* at 1333, 62 USPQ2d
 at 1429; *D.L. Auld Co. v. Chroma Graphics Corp.,* 714 F.2d 1144,
 1147-48, 219 USPQ 13, 15-16 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Even though the sale of a product
 made by a claimed method before the critical date did not reveal anything about
 the method to the public, the sale resulted in a "forfeiture" of any right to a
 patent to that method); *W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc. v. Garlock,
 Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 1550, 220 USPQ 303, 310 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The
 application of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** would also be triggered by
 actually performing the claimed process itself for consideration. See
 *Scaltech, Inc. v. Retec/Tetra, L.L.C.,* 269 F.3d 1321, 1328,
 60 USPQ2d 1687, 1691(Fed. Cir. 2001) (Patent was held invalid under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** based on patentee’s offer to perform the
 claimed process for treating oil refinery waste more than one year before filing
 the patent application). Moreover, the sale of a device embodying a claimed
 process may trigger the on-sale bar. *Minton v. National Ass’n. of
 Securities Dealers, Inc.,* 336 F.3d 1373, 1378, 67 USPQ2d 1614, 1618
 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (finding a fully operational computer program implementing and
 thus embodying the claimed method to trigger the on-sale bar). However, the sale
 of a prior art device different from that disclosed in a patent that is asserted
 after the critical date to be capable of performing the claimed method is not an
 on-sale bar of the process. *Poly-America LP v. GSE Lining Tech.
 Inc.,* 383 F.3d 1303, 1308-09, 72 USPQ2d 1685, 1688-89 (Fed. Cir.
 2004) (stating that the transaction involving the sale of the prior art device did
 not involve a transaction of the claimed method but instead only a device
 different from that described in the patent for carrying out the claimed method,
 where the device was not used to practice the claimed method until well after the
 critical date, and where there was evidence that it was not even known whether the
 device could perform the claimed process).

 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bars, public use or on sale activity must take
 place in the United States. The "on sale" bar does not generally apply where both
 manufacture and delivery occur in a foreign country. *Gandy v. Main Belting
 Co.,* 143 U.S. 587, 593 (1892). However, "on sale" status can be found if
 substantial activity prefatory to a "sale" occurs in the United States.
 *Robbins Co. v. Lawrence Mfg. Co.,* 482 F.2d 426, 433, 178 USPQ
 577, 583 (9th Cir. 1973). An offer for sale, made or originating in this country, may
 be sufficient prefatory activity to bring the offer within the terms of the statute,
 even though sale and delivery take place in a foreign country. The same rationale
 applies to an offer by a foreign manufacturer which is communicated to a prospective
 purchaser in the United States prior to the critical date. *CTS Corp. v.
 Piher Int’l Corp.,* 593 F.2d 777, 201 USPQ 649 (7th Cir. 1979).

The question posed by the experimental use doctrine is "whether the
 primary purpose of the inventor at the time of the sale, as determined from an
 objective evaluation of the facts surrounding the transaction, was to conduct
 experimentation." *Allen Eng’g Corp. v. Bartell Indus., Inc.,* 299
 F.3d 1336, 1354, 63 USPQ2d 1769, 1780 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting *EZ Dock v.
 Schafer Sys., Inc.,* 276 F.3d 1347, 1356-57, 61 USPQ2d 1289, 1295-96
 (Fed. Cir. 2002)) (Linn, J., concurring). Experimentation must be the primary purpose
 and any commercial exploitation must be incidental in order for the sale to be a
 permitted activity that does not create a bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. 
 


If the use or sale was experimental, there is no bar under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. "A use or sale is experimental for purposes of
 **[[pre-AIA]
 section 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** if it represents a *bona fide*
 effort to perfect the invention or to ascertain whether it will answer its intended
 purpose.… If any commercial exploitation does occur, it must be merely incidental to
 the primary purpose of the experimentation to perfect the invention."
 *LaBounty Mfg. v. United States Int’l Trade Comm’n,* 958 F.2d
 1066, 1071, 22 USPQ2d 1025, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (quoting *Pennwalt Corp. v.

 "The experimental use exception…does not include market testing where the inventor is
 attempting to gauge consumer demand for his claimed invention. The purpose of such
 activities is commercial exploitation and not experimentation." *In re
 Smith,* 714 F.2d 1127, 1134, 218 USPQ 976, 983 (Fed. Cir. 1983).
 



# 2133.03(e)(1) Commercial Exploitation [R-08.2017]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §

 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject
 to those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)**
 for a detailed discussion of the public use and on sale provisions of
 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


One policy of the on sale and public use bars is the prevention
 of inventors from exploiting their inventions commercially more than 1 year prior
 to the filing of a patent application. Therefore, if applicant’s precritical date
 activity is a sale or offer for sale that is an attempt at market penetration, a
 patent is barred. Thus, even if there is *bona fide* experimental
 activity, an inventor may not commercially exploit an invention more than 1 year
 prior to the filing date of an application. *In re Theis,* 610
 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA 1979).
 

**I.** **THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY MUST LEGITIMATELY ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
 INVENTION TOWARDS COMPLETION**As the degree of commercial exploitation surrounding
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** activity increases, the burden on an
 applicant to establish clear and convincing evidence of experimental activity
 with respect to a public use becomes more difficult. Where the examiner has
 found a *prima facie* case of a sale or an offer to sell, this
 burden will rarely be met unless clear and convincing necessity for the
 experimentation is established by the applicant. This does not mean, of course,
 that there are no circumstances which would permit alleged experimental
 activity in an atmosphere of commercial exploitation. In certain circumstances,
 even a sale may be necessary to legitimately advance the experimental
 development of an invention if the primary purpose of the sale is experimental.
 *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA
 1979); *Robbins Co. v. Lawrence Mfg. Co.,* 482 F.2d 426, 433,
 178 USPQ 577, 582 (9th Cir. 1973). However, careful scrutiny by the examiner of
 the objective factual circumstances surrounding such a sale is essential. See
 *Ushakoff v. United States,* 327 F.2d 669, 140 USPQ 341
 (Ct.Cl. 1964); *Cloud v. Standard Packaging Corp.,* 376 F.2d

**II.** **SIGNIFICANT FACTORS INDICATIVE OF "COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION"**As discussed in **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**, a policy
 consideration in questions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 activity is premature "commercial exploitation" of a "completed" or "ready for
 patenting" invention (see **[MPEP § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)**). The extent
 of commercial activity which constitutes **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 "on sale" status depends upon the circumstances of the activity, the basic
 indicator being the subjective intent of the inventor as manifested through
 objective evidence. The following activities should be used by the examiner as
 indicia of this subjective intent:
 


* (A) Preparation of various contemporaneous "commercial"
 documents, e.g., orders, invoices, receipts, delivery schedules, etc.;
* (B) Preparation of price lists *(Akron

"When sales are made in an ordinary commercial environment and
 the goods are placed outside the inventor’s control, an inventor’s secretly held
 subjective intent to ‘experiment,’ even if true, is unavailing without objective
 evidence to support the contention. Under such circumstances, the customer at a
 minimum must be made aware of the experimentation." *LaBounty Mfg., Inc.

# 2133.03(e)(3) "Completeness" of the Invention [R-11.2013]

 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**I.** **EXPERIMENTAL USE ENDS WHEN THE INVENTION IS ACTUALLY REDUCED TO
 PRACTICE**Experimental use "means perfecting or completing an invention
 to the point of determining that it will work for its intended purpose."
 Therefore, experimental use "ends with an actual reduction to practice."
 *RCA Corp.**v.**Data Gen. Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1061, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1453
 (Fed. Cir. 1989). If the examiner concludes from the evidence of record that an
 applicant was satisfied that an invention was in fact "complete," awaiting
 approval by the applicant from an organization such as Underwriters’
 Laboratories will not normally overcome this conclusion. *Interroyal
 Corp. v. Simmons Co.,* 204 USPQ 562, 566 (S.D.N.Y. 1979);
 *Skil Corp. v. Rockwell Manufacturing Co.,* 358 F. Supp.
 1257, 1261, 178 USPQ 562, 565 (N.D.Ill. 1973), *aff’d. in part, rev’d
 in part sub nom.**Skil Corp. v. Lucerne Products Inc.,* 503 F.2d 745, 183 USPQ
 396, 399 (7th Cir. 1974), *cert. denied,* 420 U.S. 974, 185
 USPQ 65 (1975). See **[MPEP § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)** for more
 information of what constitutes a "complete" invention.
 


The fact that alleged experimental activity does not lead to
 specific modifications or refinements of an invention is evidence, although not
 conclusive evidence, that such activity is not within the realm permitted by
 the statute. This is especially the case where the evidence of record clearly
 demonstrates to the examiner that an invention was considered "complete" by an
 inventor at the time of the activity. Nevertheless, any modifications or
 refinements which did result from such experimental activity must at least be a
 feature of the claimed invention to be of any probative value. *In re
 Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA 1979).
 

**II.** **DISPOSAL OF PROTOTYPES**Where a prototype of an invention has been disposed of by an
 inventor before the critical date, inquiry by the examiner should focus upon
 the intent of the inventor and the reasonableness of the disposal under all
 circumstances. The fact that an otherwise reasonable disposal of a prototype
 involves incidental income is not necessarily fatal. *In re
 Dybel,* 524 F.2d 1393, 1399, n.5, 187 USPQ 593, 597 n.5 (CCPA
 1975). However, if a prototype is considered "complete" by an inventor and all
 experimentation on the underlying invention has ceased, unrestricted disposal
 of the prototype constitutes a bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *In re Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 113 USPQ 289 (CCPA 1957);

The courts have considered a number of factors in determining
 whether a claimed invention was the subject of a commercial offer for sale
 primarily for purposes of experimentation. "These factors include: (1) the
 necessity for public testing, (2) the amount of control over the experiment
 retained by the inventor, (3) the nature of the invention, (4) the length of the
 test period, (5) whether payment was made, (6) whether there was a secrecy
 obligation, (7) whether records of the experiment were kept, (8) who conducted the
 experiment, ... (9) the degree of commercial exploitation during testing[,] ...
 (10) whether the invention reasonably requires evaluation under actual conditions
 of use, (11) whether testing was systematically performed, (12) whether the
 inventor continually monitored the invention during testing, and (13) the nature
 of contacts made with potential customers." *Allen Eng’g Corp. v. Bartell
 Indus., Inc.,* 299 F.3d 1336, 1353, 63 USPQ2d 1769, 1780 (Fed. Cir.
 2002) (quoting *EZ Dock v. Schafer Sys., Inc.,* 276 F.3d 1347,
 1357, 61 USPQ2d 1289, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2002)) (Linn, J., concurring). Another
 critical attribute of experimentation is the "customer’s awareness of the
 purported testing in the context of a sale." *Electromotive Div. of Gen.
 Motors Corp. v. Transportation Sys. Div. of Gen. Elec. Co.,* 417 F.3d
 1203, 1241, 75 USPQ2d 1650, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
 


Once alleged experimental activity is advanced by an applicant to
 explain a *prima facie* case under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the examiner must determine whether the scope and
 length of the activity were reasonable in terms of the experimental purpose
 intended by the applicant and the nature of the subject matter involved. No one
 of, or particular combination of, factors is necessarily determinative of this
 purpose.

**THE INVENTOR MUST MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER THE INVENTION DURING
 TESTING BY THIRD PARTIES**The significant determinative factors in questions of
 experimental purpose are the extent of supervision and control maintained by an
 inventor over an invention during an alleged period of experimentation , and
 the customer’s awareness of the experimentation. *Electromotive Div. of
 Gen. Motors Corp. v. Transportation Sys. Div. of Gen. Elec. Co.,*

 awareness ordinarily must be proven if experimentation is to be found"). Once a
 period of experimental activity has ended and supervision and control has been
 relinquished by an inventor without any restraints on subsequent use of an
 invention, an unrestricted subsequent use of the invention is a
 **[pre-AIA 35

 constitute permissible activity. See *General Motors Corp. v. Bendix
 Aviation Corp.,* 123 F. Supp. 506, 521, 102 USPQ 58, 69 (N.D.Ind.
 1954). For example, where an invention relates to a chemical composition with
 no known utility, i.e., a patent application for the composition could not be
 filed (**[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**; **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph), continued testing to find
 utility would likely be permissible under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**,
 absent a sale of the composition or other evidence of commercial exploitation.
 
 

**II.** **MARKET TESTING IS NOT PERMITTED**Experimentation to determine product acceptance, i.e., market
 testing, is typical of a trader’s and not an inventor’s experiment and is thus
 not within the area of permitted experimental activity. *Smith &
 Davis Mfg. Co. v. Mellon,* 58 F. 705, 707 (8th Cir. 1893) Likewise,
 testing of an invention for the benefit of appeasing a customer, or to conduct
 "minor ‘tune up’ procedures not requiring an inventor’s skills, but rather the
 skills of a competent technician," are also not within the exception.
 *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 193-94
 (CCPA 1979).
 

**III.** **EXPERIMENTAL ACTIVITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DESIGN APPLICATIONS**The public use of an ornamental design which is directed
 toward generating consumer interest in the aesthetics of the design is not an
 experimental use. *In re Mann,* 861 F.2d 1581, 8 USPQ2d 2030
 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (display of a wrought iron table at a trade show held to be
 public use). However, "experimentation directed to functional features of a
 product also containing an ornamental design may negate what otherwise would be
 considered a public use within the meaning of **[section
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**." *Tone Brothers, Inc.**v.**Sysco Corp.,* 28 F.3d 1192, 1196, 31 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed.
 Cir. 1994) (A study wherein students evaluated the effect of the functional
 features of a spice container design may be considered an experimental
 use.).

 are applicable even though public use or on sale activity is by a party other
 than an applicant. Where an applicant presents evidence of experimental
 activity by such other party, the evidence will not overcome the *prima

 based upon the activity of such party unless the activity was under the
 supervision and control of the applicant. *In re Hamilton,*
 882 F.2d 1576, 1581, 111 USPQ2d 1890, 1894 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("The experimental
 use doctrine operates in the inventor's favor to allow *the
 inventor* to refine his invention or to assess its value relative
 to the time and expense of prosecuting a patent application. If it is not the
 inventor or someone under his control or ‘surveillance’ who does these things,
 there appears to us no reason why he should be entitled to rely upon them to
 avoid the statute.") (citing *Magnetics, Inc. v. Arnold Engineering
 Co.,* 438 F.2d 72, 74, 168 USPQ 392, 394 (7th Cir.1971)). In other
 words, the experimental use activity exception is personal to an applicant.

 arises where the invention is in public use before the critical date and is ready
 for patenting. *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing L.P.,*
 424 F.3d 1374, 76 USPQ2d 1741 (Fed. Cir. 2005). As explained by the court,

*Id.* at 1380, 76 USPQ2d at 1744 (citations omitted). See
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e203781)** for a discussion of the "ready for patenting"
 prong of the public use and on sale statutory bars.
 


"[T]o constitute the public use of an invention it is not
 necessary that more than one of the patent articles should be publicly used. The
 use of a great number may tend to strengthen the proof, but one well defined case
 of such use is just as effectual to annul the patent as many." Likewise, it is not
 necessary that more than one person use the invention. *Egbert
 v.**Lippmann,* 104 U.S. 333, 336 (1881).
 

**II.** **PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE IS NOT NECESSARILY PUBLIC USE UNDER Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)**Mere knowledge of the invention by the public does not warrant
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bars public use or sale, not public knowledge.
 *TP**Labs., Inc. v. Professional Positioners, Inc.,* 724 F.2d 965,
 970, 220 USPQ 577, 581 (Fed. Cir. 1984).
 


Note, however, that public knowledge may provide grounds for
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[MPEP § 2132](s2132.html#d0e203390)**. 
 

***A.*** ***Commercial Versus Noncommercial Use and the Impact of
 Secrecy***There are limited circumstances in which a secret or
 confidential use of an invention may give rise to the public use bar.
 "[S]ecrecy of use alone is not sufficient to show that existing knowledge has
 not been withdrawn from public use; commercial exploitation is also forbidden."
 *Invitrogen,* 424 F.3d at 1382, 76 USPQ2d at 1745-46 (The
 fact that patentee secretly used the claimed invention internally before the
 critical date to develop future products that were never sold was by itself
 insufficient to create a public use bar to patentability.).
 

**1.** **"Public Use" and "Non-secret Use" Are Not Necessarily
 Synonymous**"Public" is not necessarily synonymous with "non- secret."
 The fact "that non-secret uses of the device were made [by the inventor or
 someone connected with the inventor] prior to the critical date is not
 itself dispositive of the issue of whether activity barring a patent under
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** occurred. The fact that the device
 was not hidden from view may make the use not secret, but nonsecret use is
 not *ipso facto* ‘public use’ activity. Nor, it must be
 added, is all secret use *ipso facto* not ‘public use’
 within the meaning of the statute," if the inventor is making commercial use
 of the invention under circumstances which preserve its secrecy. *TP
 Labs., Inc.**v.**Professional Positioners, Inc.,* 724 F.2d 965, 972, 220
 USPQ 577, 583 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (citations omitted). 
 

**2.** **Even If the Invention Is Hidden, Inventor Who Puts Machine or Article
 Embodying the Invention in Public View Is Barred from Obtaining a Patent
 as the Invention Is in Public Use** When the inventor or someone connected to the inventor puts
 the invention on display or sells it, there is a "public use" within the
 meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** even though by its very
 nature an invention is completely hidden from view as part of a larger
 machine or article, if the invention is otherwise used in its natural and
 intended way and the larger machine or article is accessible to the public.
 *In re Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 783, 113 USPQ 289, 292
 (CCPA 1957); *Hall**v. Macneale,* 107 U.S. 90, 96-97 (1882); *Ex
 parte**Kuklo,* 25 USPQ2d 1387, 1390 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992) (Display of equipment including the structural features of the claimed
 invention to visitors of laboratory is public use even though public did not
 see inner workings of device. The person to whom the invention is publicly
 disclosed need not understand the significance and technical complexities of
 the invention.).
 

**3.** **There Is No Public Use If Inventor Restricted Use to Locations Where
 There Was a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy and the Use Was for His or
 Her Own Enjoyment** An inventor’s private use of the invention, for his or her
 own enjoyment is not a public use. *Moleculon Research
 Corp.**v. CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809
 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Inventor showed inventive puzzle to close friends while in
 his dorm room and later the president of the company at which he was working
 saw the puzzle on the inventor’s desk and they discussed it. Court held that
 the inventor retained control and thus these actions did not result in a
 "public use.").
 

**4.** **The Presence or Absence of a Confidentiality Agreement is Not
 Dispositive of the Public Use Issue**"The presence or absence of a confidentiality agreement is
 not dispositive of the public use issue, but ‘is one factor to be considered
 in assessing all the evidence.’" *Bernhardt, L.L.C. v. Collezione
 Europa USA, Inc.,* 386 F.3d 1371, 1380-81, 72 USPQ2d 1901, 1909
 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting *Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS
 Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1266, 229 USPQ 805, 808 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).
 The court stressed that it is necessary to analyze the evidence of public
 use in the context of policies that underlie the public use and on sale bar
 that include "‘discouraging removal of inventions from the public domain
 that the public justifiably believes are freely available, prohibiting an
 extension of the period for exploiting an invention, and favoring prompt and
 widespread disclosure of inventions.’" *Bernhardt,* 386
 F.3d at 1381, 72 USPQ2d at 1909. See also *Invitrogen,* 424
 F.3d at 1379, 76 USPQ2d at 1744; **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**, subsection
 I. Evidence that the court emphasized included the "‘nature of the activity
 that occurred in public; the public access to and knowledge of the public
 use; [and] whether there were any confidentiality obligations imposed on
 persons who observed the use.’" *Bernhardt,* 386 F.3d at
 1381, 72 USPQ2d at 1909. For example, the court in
 *Bernhardt* noted that an exhibition display at issue in
 the case "was not open to the public, that the identification of attendees
 was checked against a list of authorized names by building security and
 later at a reception desk near the showroom, that attendees were escorted
 through the showroom, and that the attendees were not permitted to make
 written notes or take photographs inside the showroom."
 *Id.* The court remanded the issue of whether the
 exhibition display was a public use for further proceedings since the
 district court "focused on the absence of any confidentiality agreements and
 did not discuss or analyze how the totality of the circumstances
 surrounding" the exhibition "comports with the policies underlying the
 public use bar." *Id.*

***B.*** ***Use by Third Parties Deriving the Invention from
 Applicant**** 

**An Invention Is in Public Use If the Inventor Allows Another To Use
 the Invention Without Restriction or Obligation of Secrecy**"Public use" of a claimed invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** occurs when the inventor allows another person
 to use the invention without limitation, restriction or obligation of
 secrecy to the inventor."  *In re Smith,* 714 F.2d 1127,
 1134, 218 USPQ 976, 983 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The presence or absence of a
 confidentiality agreement is not itself determinative of the public use
 issue, but is one factor to be considered along with the time, place, and
 circumstances of the use which show the amount of control the inventor
 retained over the invention. *Moleculon Research Corp.**v. CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809
 (Fed. Cir. 1986). See *Ex parte C,* 27 USPQ2d 1492, 1499
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (Inventor sold inventive soybean seeds to
 growers who contracted and were paid to plant the seeds to increase stock
 for later sale. The commercial nature of the use of the seed coupled with
 the "on-sale" aspects of the contract and apparent lack of confidentiality
 requirements rose to the level of a "public use" bar.); *Egbert
 v.**Lippmann,* 104 U.S. 333, 336 (1881) (Public use found
 where inventor allowed another to use inventive corset insert, though hidden
 from view during use, because he did not impose an obligation of secrecy or
 restrictions on its use.). 
 

***C.*** ***Use by Independent Third Parties**** 

Use by an Independent Third Party Is Public Use If
 It Sufficiently "Informs" the Public of the Invention or a Competitor Could
 Reasonably Ascertain the Invention
 Any "nonsecret" use of an invention by someone unconnected
 to the inventor, such as someone who has independently made the invention,
 in the ordinary course of a business for trade or profit may be a "public
 use," *Bird Provision Co. v. Owens Country Sausage,**Inc.,* 568 F.2d 369, 374-76, 197 USPQ 134, 138-40 (5th
 Cir. 1978). Additionally, even a "secret" use by another inventor of a
 machine or process to make a product is "public" if the details of the
 machine or process are ascertainable by inspection or analysis of the
 product that is sold or publicly displayed. *Gillman v.
 Stern,* 114 F.2d 28, 46 USPQ 430 (2d Cir. 1940); *Dunlop
 Holdings, Ltd. v. Ram Golf Corp.,* 524 F.2d 33, 36-7, 188 USPQ
 481, 483-484 (7th Cir. 1975). If the details of an inventive process are not
 ascertainable from the product sold or displayed and the third party has
 kept the invention as a trade secret then that use is not a public use and
 will not bar a patent issuing to someone unconnected to the user.
 *W.L. Gore & Assocs. v. Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d
 1540, 1550, 220 USPQ 303, 310 (Fed. Cir. 1983). However, a device qualifies
 as prior art if it places the claimed features in the
 public's possession before the critical date even if other
 unclaimed aspects of the device were not publicly
 available. *Lockwood v. American Airlines, Inc.,* 107 F.3d
 1505, 1570-71, 41 USPQ2d 1961, 1964-65 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Computer
 reservation system was prior art even though "essential algorithms of the
 SABRE software were proprietary and confidential and...those aspects of the
 system that were readily apparent to the public would not have been
 sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to duplicate the [unclaimed
 aspects of the] system."). The extent that the public becomes "informed" of
 an invention involved in public use activity by one other than an applicant
 depends upon the factual circumstances surrounding the activity and how
 these comport with the policies underlying the on sale and public use bars.
 *Manville Sales Corp. v. Paramount Sys., Inc*., 917 F.2d
 544, 549, 16 USPQ2d 1587, 1591 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (quoting *King
 Instrument Corp.**v. Otari Corp.,* 767 F.2d 833, 860, 226 USPQ 402, 406
 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). By way of example, in an allegedly "secret" use by a
 third party other than an applicant, if a large number of employees of such
 a party, who are not under a promise of secrecy, are permitted unimpeded
 access to an invention, with affirmative steps by the party to educate other
 employees as to the nature of the invention, the public is "informed."
 *Chemithon Corp.**v.**Proctor & Gamble Co.,* 287 F. Supp. 291, 308, 159 USPQ
 139, 154 (D.Md. 1968), *aff’d.,* 427 F.2d 893, 165 USPQ 678
 (4th Cir. 1970).
 


Even if public use activity by one other than an applicant
 is not sufficiently "informing," there may be adequate grounds upon which to
 base a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See  *Dunlop

 **[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


An impermissible sale has occurred if there was a definite sale, or
 offer to sell, more than 1 year before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention and the subject matter of the sale, or offer to sell, fully anticipated the
 claimed invention or would have rendered the claimed invention obvious by its
 addition to the prior art. *Ferag AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45 F.3d 1562,
 1565, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1514 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The on-sale bar of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is triggered if the invention is both (1) the subject of
 a commercial offer for sale not primarily for experimental purposes and (2) ready for
 patenting. *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48 USPQ2d
 1641, 1646-47 (1998). Traditional contract law principles are applied when
 determining whether a commercial offer for sale has occurred. See *Linear
 Tech. Corp. v. Micrel, Inc.,* 275 F.3d 1040, 1048, 61 USPQ2d 1225, 1229
 (Fed. Cir. 2001), *petition for cert. filed,* 71 USLW 3093 (July 03,
 2002) (No. 02-39); *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc.,* 254
 F.3d 1041,1047, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("As a general proposition, we
 will look to the Uniform Commercial Code (‘UCC’) to define whether … a communication
 or series of communications rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale.").
 

**I.** **THE MEANING OF "SALE"**A sale is a contract between parties wherein the seller agrees
 "to give and to pass rights of property" in return for the buyer’s payment or
 promise "to pay the seller for the things bought or sold." *In re
 Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 676, 226 USPQ 1, 4 (Fed. Cir. 1985). A
 contract for the sale of goods requires a concrete offer and acceptance of that
 offer. See, e.g., *Linear Tech.,* 275 F.3d at 1052-54, 61 USPQ2d
 at 1233-34 (Court held there was no sale within the meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** where prospective purchaser submitted an order for
 goods at issue, but received an order acknowledgement reading "will advise-not
 booked." Prospective purchaser would understand that order was not accepted.).
 


"[T]o be ‘on sale’ under **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**, a
 product must be the subject of a commercial sale or offer for sale," and to be a
 commercial sale it must be "one that bears the general hallmarks of a sale
 pursuant to Section 2-106 of the Uniform Commercial Code." *Medicines Co.
 v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363, 1364 119 USPQ2d 1329, 1330 (Fed.
 Cir. 2016) (en banc). The court in *Medicines Co.* went on to
 explain "[s]ection 2-106(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code describes a ‘sale’ as
 ‘the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.’ U.C.C. §
 2-106(1). The passage of title is a helpful indicator of whether a product is ‘on
 sale,’ as it suggests when the inventor gives up its interest and control over the
 product." *Id.* at 1375, 119 USPQ2d at 1338. The
 *Medicines Co.* court held "a contract manufacturer’s sale to
 the inventor of manufacturing services where neither title to the embodiments nor
 the right to market the same passes to the supplier does not constitute an
 invalidating sale under **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**."
 *Id.* at 1381, 119 USPQ2d at 1342.
 

***A.******Conditional Sale May Bar a Patent***An invention may be deemed to be "on sale" even though the
 sale was conditional. The fact that the sale is conditioned on buyer
 satisfaction does not, without more, prove that the sale was for an
 experimental purpose. *Strong v. General Elec. Co.,* 434 F.2d
 1042, 1046, 168 USPQ 8, 12 (5th Cir. 1970).
 

***B.******Nonprofit Sale May Bar a Patent***A "sale" need not be for profit to bar a patent. If the sale
 was for the commercial exploitation of the invention, it is "on sale" within
 the meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *In re Dybel,* 524 F.2d 1393, 1401, 187 USPQ 593, 599 (CCPA
 1975) ("Although selling the devices for a profit would have demonstrated the
 purpose of commercial exploitation, the fact that appellant realized no profit
 from the sales does not demonstrate the contrary.").
 

***C.******A Single Sale or Offer To Sell May Bar a Patent***Even a single sale or offer to sell the invention may bar
 patentability under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *Consolidated**Fruit-Jar Co. v. Wright,* 94 U.S. 92, 94 (1876);

 834, 836-37, 23 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
 

***D.******A Sale of Rights Is Not a Sale of the Invention and Will Not in
 Itself Bar a Patent***"[A]n assignment or sale of the rights in the invention and
 potential patent rights is not a sale of ‘the invention’ within the meaning of
 **[[pre-AIA]
 section 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**." *Moleculon Research Corp. v.
 CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 1267, 229 USPQ 805, 809 (Fed. Cir.
 1986); see also *Elan Corp., PLC v. Andrx Pharms. Inc.,*
 366 F.3d 1336, 1341, 70 USPQ2d 1722, 1728 (Fed. Cir. 2004); *In re
 Kollar,* 286 F.3d 1326, 1330 n.3, 1330-1331, 62 USPQ2d 1425, 1428
 n.3, 1428-1429 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (distinguishing licenses which trigger the
 on-sale bar (e.g., a standard computer software license wherein the product is
 just as immediately transferred to the licensee as if it were sold), from
 licenses that merely grant rights to an invention which do not *per
 se* trigger the on-sale bar (e.g., exclusive rights to market the
 invention or potential patent rights)); *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark
 Cards, Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041, 1049 n. 2, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1129 n. 2
 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
 


"[T]he mere sale of manufacturing services by a
 contract manufacturer to an inventor to create embodiments of a patented
 product for the inventor does not constitute a ‘commercial sale’ of the
 invention." *Medicines Co. v. Hospira, Inc.,* 827 F.3d 1363,
 1373 119 USPQ2d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (*en banc*). The
 court in *Medicines Co.* further stated that "commercial
 benefit—even to both parties in a transaction—is not enough to trigger the
 on-sale bar of **[§ 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**; the transaction
 must be one in which the product is ‘on sale’ in the sense that it is
 ‘commercially marketed.’" *Id.* at 1373-74, 119 USPQ2d at
 1336-37.
 

***E.******Buyer Must Be Uncontrolled by the Seller or Offerer***A sale or offer for sale must take place between separate
 entities. *In re Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 676, 226 USPQ 1, 4
 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Where the parties to the alleged sale are related, whether
 there is a statutory bar depends on whether the seller so controls the
 purchaser that the invention remains out of the public’s hands. *Ferag
 AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45 F.3d 1562, 1566, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1515 (Fed.
 Cir. 1995) (Where the seller is a parent company of the buyer company, but the
 President of the buyer company had "essentially unfettered" management
 authority over the operations of the buyer company, the sale was a statutory
 bar.).
 

**II.** **OFFERS FOR SALE**"Only an offer which rises to the level of a commercial offer for
 sale, one which the other party could make into a binding contract by simple
 acceptance (assuming consideration), constitutes an offer for sale under
 **[§102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**." *Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards,
 Inc.,* 254 F.3d 1041,1048, 59 USPQ2d 1121, 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 
 

***A.******Rejected or Unreceived Offer for Sale Is Enough To Bar a
 Patent***Since the statute creates a bar when an invention is placed
 "on sale," a mere offer to sell is sufficient commercial activity to bar a
 patent. *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 791, 204 USPQ 188, 192
 (CCPA 1979). Even a rejected offer may create an on sale bar. *UMC
 Elecs. v. United States,* 816 F.2d 647, 653, 2 USPQ2d 1465, 1469
 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In fact, the offer need not even be actually received by a
 prospective purchaser. *Wende v. Horine,* 225 F. 501 (7th Cir.
 1915). 
 

***B.******Delivery of the Offered Item Is Not Required***"It is not necessary that a sale be consummated for the bar to
 operate." *Buildex v. Kason Indus.,**Inc.,* 849 F.2d 1461, 1463-64, 7 USPQ2d 1325, 1327-28 (Fed.
 Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). See also *Weatherchem Corp. v. J.L.
 Clark, Inc.,* 163 F.3d 1326, 1333, 49 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-07 (Fed.
 Cir. 1998) (A signed purchase agreement prior to the critical date constituted
 a commercial offer; it was immaterial that there was no delivery of later
 patented caps and no exchange of money until after critical date.).
 

***C.******Seller Need Not Have the Goods "On Hand" When the Offer for Sale Is
 Made***Goods need not be "on hand" and transferred at the time of the
 sale or offer. The date of the offer for sale is the effective date of the "on
 sale" activity. *J. A. La Porte, Inc. v. Norfolk Dredging
 Co.,* 787 F.2d 1577, 1582, 229 USPQ 435, 438 (Fed. Cir. 1986).
 However, the invention must be complete and "ready for patenting" (see
 **[MPEP §
 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)**) before the critical date. *Pfaff
 v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 67, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647
 (1998). See also *Micro Chemical, Inc. v. Great Plains Chemical
 Co.,* 103 F.3d 1538, 1545, 41 USPQ2d 1238, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1997)
 (The on-sale bar was not triggered by an offer to sell because the inventor
 "was not close to completion of the invention at the time of the alleged offer
 and had not demonstrated a high likelihood that the invention would work for
 its intended purpose upon completion."); *Shatterproof Glass Corp. v.
 Libbey-Owens Ford Co.,* 758 F.2d 613, 225 USPQ 634 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (Where there was no evidence that the samples shown to the potential customers
 were made by the new process and apparatus, the offer to sell did not rise to
 the level of an on sale bar.). Compare *Barmag Barmer Maschinenfabrik
 AG v. Murata Mach., Ltd.,* 731 F.2d 831, 221 USPQ 561 (Fed. Cir.
 1984) (Where a "make shift" model of the inventive product was shown to the
 potential purchasers in conjunction with the offer to sell, the offer was
 enough to bar a patent under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.).
 
 

***D.******Material Terms of an Offer for Sale Must be Present***"[A] communication that fails to constitute a definite offer
 to sell the product and to include material terms is not an ‘offer’ in the
 contract sense." *Elan Corp., PLC v. Andrx Pharms. Inc.,* 366
 F.3d 1336, 1341, 70 USPQ2d 1722, 1728 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court stated that
 an "offer to enter into a license under a patent for future sale of the
 invention covered by the patent when and if it has been developed... is not an
 offer to sell the patented invention that constitutes an on-sale bar."
 *Id.,* 70 USPQ2d at 1726. Accordingly, the court concluded
 that Elan’s letter was not an offer to sell a product. In addition, the court
 stated that the letter lacked material terms of a commercial offer such as
 pricing for the product, quantities, time and place of delivery, and product
 specifications and that the dollar amount in the letter was not a price term
 for the sale of the product but rather the amount requested was to form and
 continue a partnership, explicitly referred to as a "licensing fee."
 *Id.*

**III.** **SALE BY INVENTOR, ASSIGNEE OR OTHERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVENTOR IN THE
 COURSE OF BUSINESS*****A.******Sale Activity Need Not Be Public***Unlike questions of public use, there is no requirement that
 "on sale" activity be "public." "Public" as used in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** modifies "use" only. "Public" does not modify
 "sale." *Hobbs v. United States,* 451 F.2d 849, 171 USPQ 713,
 720 (5th Cir. 1971). 
 

***B.******Inventor’s Consent to the Sale Is Not a Prerequisite To Finding an
 On Sale Bar***If the invention was placed on sale by a third party who
 obtained the invention from the inventor, a patent is barred even if the
 inventor did not consent to the sale or have knowledge that the invention was
 embodied in the sold article. *Electric Storage Battery Co. v.
 Shimadzu,* 307 U.S. 5, 41 USPQ 155 (1938); *In re
 Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 783, 113 USPQ 289, 292 (CCPA 1957);
 *CTS Corp. v. Electro Materials Corp. of America,* 469 F.
 Supp. 801, 819, 202 USPQ 22, 38 (S.D.N.Y. 1979). 
 

***C.******Objective Evidence of Sale or Offer To Sell Is Needed***In determining if a sale or offer to sell the claimed
 invention has occurred, a key question to ask is whether the inventor sold or
 offered for sale a product that embodies the invention claimed in the
 application. Objective evidence such as a description of the inventive product
 in the contract of sale or in another communication with the purchaser controls
 over an uncommunicated intent by the seller to deliver the inventive product
 under the contract for sale. *Ferag AG v. Quipp, Inc.,* 45
 F.3d 1562, 1567, 33 USPQ2d 1512, 1516 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (On sale bar found where
 initial negotiations and agreement containing contract for sale neither clearly
 specified nor precluded use of the inventive design, but an order confirmation
 prior to the critical date did specify use of inventive design.). The purchaser
 need not have actual knowledge of the invention for it to be on sale. The
 determination of whether "the offered product is in fact the claimed invention
 may be established by any relevant evidence, such as memoranda, drawings,
 correspondence, and testimony of witnesses." *RCA Corp. v. Data Gen.
 Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1060, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 However, "what the purchaser reasonably believes the inventor to be offering is
 relevant to whether, on balance, the offer objectively may be said to be of the
 patented invention." *Envirotech Corp. v. Westech Eng’g,
 Inc.,* 904 F.2d 1571, 1576, 15 USPQ2d 1230, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
 (Where a proposal to supply a general contractor with a product did not mention
 a new design but, rather, referenced a prior art design, the uncommunicated
 intent of the supplier to supply the new design if awarded the contract did not
 constitute an "on sale" bar to a patent on the new design, even though the
 supplier’s bid reflected the lower cost of the new design.). 
 

**IV.** **SALES BY INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES*** 

***A.******Sales or Offers for Sale by Independent Third Parties Will Bar a
 Patent***Sale or offer for sale of the invention by an independent
 third party more than 1 year before the filing date of applicant’s patent will
 bar applicant from obtaining a patent. "An exception to this rule exists where
 a patented method is kept secret and remains secret after a sale of the
 unpatented product of the method. Such a sale prior to the critical date is a
 bar if engaged in by the patentee or patent applicant, but not if engaged in by
 another." *In re Caveney,* 761 F.2d 671, 675-76, 226 USPQ 1,
 3-4 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 

***B.******Nonprior Art Publications Can Be Used as Evidence of Sale Before
 the Critical Date***Abstracts identifying a product’s vendor containing
 information useful to potential buyers such as whom to contact, price terms,
 documentation, warranties, training and maintenance along with the date of
 product release or installation before the inventor’s critical date may provide
 sufficient evidence of prior sale by a third party to support a rejection based
 on **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. *In re
 Epstein,* 32 F.3d 1559, 31 USPQ2d 1817 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Examiner's
 rejection was based on nonprior art published abstracts which disclosed
 software products meeting the claims. The abstracts specified software release
 dates and dates of first installation which were more than 1 year before
 applicant’s filing date.).

#### *Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102   
 Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of right to
 patent.*


A person shall be entitled to a patent unless -


\*\*\*\*\*


* (b) the invention was…in public use or on sale in this
 country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent
 in the United States


\*\*\*\*\*


(Emphasis added).


**I.** **THE INVENTION MUST BE "READY FOR PATENTING"**In *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55,
 66-68, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647 (1998), the Supreme Court enunciated a two-prong test
 for determining whether an invention was "on sale" within the meaning of
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** even if it has not yet been reduced to
 practice. "[T]he on-sale bar applies when two conditions are satisfied before the
 critical date [more than one year before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention]. First, the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for
 sale…. Second, the invention must be ready for patenting." *Id.*
 at 67, 119 S.Ct. at 311-12, 48 USPQ2d at 1646-47. 
 


The Federal Circuit explained that the Supreme Court’s "ready for
 patenting" prong applies in the context of both the on sale and public use bars.
 *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing L.P.,* 424 F.3d
 1374, 1379, 76 USPQ2d 1741, 1744 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("A bar under **[[pre-AIA] section
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** arises where, before the critical date, the invention
 is in public use and ready for patenting."). "Ready for patenting," the second
 prong of the *Pfaff* test, "may be satisfied in at least two
 ways: by proof of reduction to practice before the critical date; or by proof that
 prior to the critical date the inventor had prepared drawings or other
 descriptions of the invention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person
 skilled in the art to practice the invention." *Id.* at 67, 199
 S.Ct. at 311-12, 48 USPQ2d at 1647 (The patent was held invalid because the
 invention for a computer chip socket was "ready for patenting" when it was offered
 for sale more than one year prior to the application filing date. Even though the
 invention had not yet been reduced to practice, the manufacturer was able to
 produce the claimed computer chip sockets using the inventor’s detailed drawings
 and specifications, and those sockets contained all elements of invention claimed
 in the patent.). See also *Weatherchem Corp. v. J.L. Clark Inc.,*
 163 F.3d 1326, 1333, 49 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-07 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The invention was
 held "ready for patenting" since the detailed drawings of plastic dispensing caps
 offered for sale "contained each limitation of the claims and were sufficiently
 specific to enable person skilled in art to practice the invention".). 
 


If the invention was actually reduced to practice before being
 sold or offered for sale more than 1 year before filing of the application, a
 patent will be barred. *Vanmoor v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,* 201
 F.3d 1363, 1366-67, 53 USPQ2d 1377, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("Here the pre-critical
 date sales were of completed cartridges made to specifications that remained
 unchanged to the present day, showing that any invention embodied in the accused
 cartridges was reduced to practice before the critical date. The
 *Pfaff* ready for patenting condition is also satisfied
 because the specification drawings, available prior to the critical date, were
 actually used to produce the accused cartridges."); *In re
 Hamilton,* 882 F.2d 1576, 1580, 11 USPQ2d 1890, 1893 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 
 "If a product that is offered for sale
 inherently possesses each of the limitations of the claims, then the invention
 is on sale, whether or not the parties to the transaction recognize that the
 product possesses the claimed characteristics."
 
 
 *Abbott Laboratories v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,* 182 F.3d
 1315, 1319, 51 USPQ2d 1307, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Claim for a particular
 anhydrous crystalline form of a pharmaceutical compound was held invalid under the
 on-sale bar of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, even though the parties to the
 U.S. sales of the foreign manufactured compound did not know the identity of the
 particular crystalline form.); *STX LLC. v. Brine Inc.,* 211 F.3d
 588, 591, 54 USPQ2d 1347, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Claim for a lacrosse stick was
 held invalid under the on-sale bar despite the argument that it was not known at
 the time of sale whether the sticks possessed the recited "improved playing and
 handling characteristics." "Subjective qualities inherent in a product, such as
 ‘improved playing and handling’, cannot serve as an escape hatch to circumvent an
 on-sale bar."). Actual reduction to practice in the context of an on-sale bar
 issue usually requires testing under actual working conditions in such a way as to
 demonstrate the practical utility of an invention for its intended purpose beyond
 the probability of failure, unless by virtue of the very simplicity of an
 invention its practical operativeness is clear. *Field v.
 Knowles,* 183 F.2d 593, 601, 86 USPQ 373, 379 (CCPA 1950);
 *Steinberg v. Seitz,* 517 F.2d 1359, 1363, 186 USPQ 209, 212
 (CCPA 1975). 
 


The invention need not be ready for satisfactory commercial
 marketing for sale to bar a patent. *Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex
 Corp.,* 970 F.2d 834, 836-37, 23 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1992).
 
 

**II.** **INVENTOR HAS SUBMITTED A 37 CFR 1.131 AFFIDAVIT OR DECLARATION**Affidavits or declarations submitted under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** to swear behind a reference may constitute, among
 other things, an admission that an invention was "complete" more than 1 year
 before the filing of an application. See *In re Foster,* 343 F.2d
 980, 987-88, 145 USPQ 166, 173 (CCPA 1965); *Dart Indus. v. E.I. duPont de
 Nemours & Co.,* 489 F.2d 1359, 1365, 179 USPQ 392, 396 (7th Cir.
 1973). Also see **[MPEP
 § 715.10](s715.html#d0e92043)**. 
 

**III.** **SALE OF A PROCESS**A claimed process, which is a series of acts or steps, is not
 sold in the same sense as is a claimed product, device, or apparatus, which is a
 tangible item. "‘Know-how’ describing what the process consists of and how the
 process should be carried out may be sold in the sense that the buyer acquires
 knowledge of the process and obtains the freedom to carry it out pursuant to the
 terms of the transaction. However, such a transaction is not a ‘sale’ of the
 invention within the meaning of **[[pre-AIA] §102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** because the
 process has not been carried out or performed as a result of the transaction."
 *In re Kollar,* 286 F.3d 1326, 1332, 62 USPQ2d 1425, 1429
 (Fed. Cir. 2002). However, sale of a product made by the claimed process by the
 patentee or a licensee would constitute a sale of the process within the meaning
 of **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See *id.* at 1333, 62 USPQ2d
 at 1429; *D.L. Auld Co. v. Chroma Graphics Corp.,* 714 F.2d 1144,
 1147-48, 219 USPQ 13, 15-16 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Even though the sale of a product
 made by a claimed method before the critical date did not reveal anything about
 the method to the public, the sale resulted in a "forfeiture" of any right to a
 patent to that method); *W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc. v. Garlock,
 Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 1550, 220 USPQ 303, 310 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The
 application of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** would also be triggered by
 actually performing the claimed process itself for consideration. See
 *Scaltech, Inc. v. Retec/Tetra, L.L.C.,* 269 F.3d 1321, 1328,
 60 USPQ2d 1687, 1691(Fed. Cir. 2001) (Patent was held invalid under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** based on patentee’s offer to perform the
 claimed process for treating oil refinery waste more than one year before filing
 the patent application). Moreover, the sale of a device embodying a claimed
 process may trigger the on-sale bar. *Minton v. National Ass’n. of
 Securities Dealers, Inc.,* 336 F.3d 1373, 1378, 67 USPQ2d 1614, 1618
 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (finding a fully operational computer program implementing and
 thus embodying the claimed method to trigger the on-sale bar). However, the sale
 of a prior art device different from that disclosed in a patent that is asserted
 after the critical date to be capable of performing the claimed method is not an
 on-sale bar of the process. *Poly-America LP v. GSE Lining Tech.
 Inc.,* 383 F.3d 1303, 1308-09, 72 USPQ2d 1685, 1688-89 (Fed. Cir.
 2004) (stating that the transaction involving the sale of the prior art device did
 not involve a transaction of the claimed method but instead only a device
 different from that described in the patent for carrying out the claimed method,
 where the device was not used to practice the claimed method until well after the
 critical date, and where there was evidence that it was not even known whether the
 device could perform the claimed process).

The language "in this country" in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** does not include other WTO or NAFTA member countries,

 commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. See also
 **[35 U.S.C.

 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bars, public use or on sale activity must take

 manufacture and delivery occur in a foreign country. *Gandy v. Main Belting

 substantial activity prefatory to a "sale" occurs in the United States.
 *Robbins Co. v. Lawrence Mfg. Co.,* 482 F.2d 426, 433, 178 USPQ

 be sufficient prefatory activity to bring the offer within the terms of the statute,
 even though sale and delivery take place in a foreign country. The same rationale
 applies to an offer by a foreign manufacturer which is communicated to a prospective
 purchaser in the United States prior to the critical date. *CTS Corp. v.

The question posed by the experimental use doctrine is "whether the
 primary purpose of the inventor at the time of the sale, as determined from an
 objective evaluation of the facts surrounding the transaction, was to conduct
 experimentation." *Allen Eng’g Corp. v. Bartell Indus., Inc.,* 299
 F.3d 1336, 1354, 63 USPQ2d 1769, 1780 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting *EZ Dock v.

 (Fed. Cir. 2002)) (Linn, J., concurring). Experimentation must be the primary purpose
 and any commercial exploitation must be incidental in order for the sale to be a
 permitted activity that does not create a bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.

 **[pre-AIA 35

 **[[pre-AIA]
 section 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** if it represents a *bona fide*
 effort to perfect the invention or to ascertain whether it will answer its intended

 the primary purpose of the experimentation to perfect the invention."

# 2133.03(e)(1) Commercial Exploitation [R-08.2017]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


One policy of the on sale and public use bars is the prevention
 of inventors from exploiting their inventions commercially more than 1 year prior
 to the filing of a patent application. Therefore, if applicant’s precritical date
 activity is a sale or offer for sale that is an attempt at market penetration, a
 patent is barred. Thus, even if there is *bona fide* experimental
 activity, an inventor may not commercially exploit an invention more than 1 year
 prior to the filing date of an application. *In re Theis,* 610
 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA 1979).
 

**I.** **THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY MUST LEGITIMATELY ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
 INVENTION TOWARDS COMPLETION**As the degree of commercial exploitation surrounding
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** activity increases, the burden on an
 applicant to establish clear and convincing evidence of experimental activity
 with respect to a public use becomes more difficult. Where the examiner has
 found a *prima facie* case of a sale or an offer to sell, this
 burden will rarely be met unless clear and convincing necessity for the
 experimentation is established by the applicant. This does not mean, of course,
 that there are no circumstances which would permit alleged experimental
 activity in an atmosphere of commercial exploitation. In certain circumstances,
 even a sale may be necessary to legitimately advance the experimental
 development of an invention if the primary purpose of the sale is experimental.
 *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA
 1979); *Robbins Co. v. Lawrence Mfg. Co.,* 482 F.2d 426, 433,
 178 USPQ 577, 582 (9th Cir. 1973). However, careful scrutiny by the examiner of
 the objective factual circumstances surrounding such a sale is essential. See
 *Ushakoff v. United States,* 327 F.2d 669, 140 USPQ 341
 (Ct.Cl. 1964); *Cloud v. Standard Packaging Corp.,* 376 F.2d
 384, 153 USPQ 317 (7th Cir. 1967). 
 

**II.** **SIGNIFICANT FACTORS INDICATIVE OF "COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION"**As discussed in **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**, a policy
 consideration in questions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 activity is premature "commercial exploitation" of a "completed" or "ready for
 patenting" invention (see **[MPEP § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)**). The extent
 of commercial activity which constitutes **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 "on sale" status depends upon the circumstances of the activity, the basic
 indicator being the subjective intent of the inventor as manifested through
 objective evidence. The following activities should be used by the examiner as
 indicia of this subjective intent:
 


* (A) Preparation of various contemporaneous "commercial"
 documents, e.g., orders, invoices, receipts, delivery schedules, etc.;
* (B) Preparation of price lists *(Akron
 Brass**Co.**v. Elkhart Brass Mfg. Co.,* 353 F.2d 704, 709, 147 USPQ

"When sales are made in an ordinary commercial environment and
 the goods are placed outside the inventor’s control, an inventor’s secretly held
 subjective intent to ‘experiment,’ even if true, is unavailing without objective
 evidence to support the contention. Under such circumstances, the customer at a
 minimum must be made aware of the experimentation." *LaBounty Mfg., Inc.

# 2133.03(e)(3) "Completeness" of the Invention [R-11.2013]

 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**I.** **EXPERIMENTAL USE ENDS WHEN THE INVENTION IS ACTUALLY REDUCED TO
 PRACTICE**Experimental use "means perfecting or completing an invention
 to the point of determining that it will work for its intended purpose."
 Therefore, experimental use "ends with an actual reduction to practice."
 *RCA Corp.**v.**Data Gen. Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1061, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1453
 (Fed. Cir. 1989). If the examiner concludes from the evidence of record that an
 applicant was satisfied that an invention was in fact "complete," awaiting
 approval by the applicant from an organization such as Underwriters’
 Laboratories will not normally overcome this conclusion. *Interroyal
 Corp. v. Simmons Co.,* 204 USPQ 562, 566 (S.D.N.Y. 1979);
 *Skil Corp. v. Rockwell Manufacturing Co.,* 358 F. Supp.
 1257, 1261, 178 USPQ 562, 565 (N.D.Ill. 1973), *aff’d. in part, rev’d
 in part sub nom.**Skil Corp. v. Lucerne Products Inc.,* 503 F.2d 745, 183 USPQ
 396, 399 (7th Cir. 1974), *cert. denied,* 420 U.S. 974, 185
 USPQ 65 (1975). See **[MPEP § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)** for more
 information of what constitutes a "complete" invention.
 


The fact that alleged experimental activity does not lead to
 specific modifications or refinements of an invention is evidence, although not
 conclusive evidence, that such activity is not within the realm permitted by
 the statute. This is especially the case where the evidence of record clearly
 demonstrates to the examiner that an invention was considered "complete" by an
 inventor at the time of the activity. Nevertheless, any modifications or
 refinements which did result from such experimental activity must at least be a
 feature of the claimed invention to be of any probative value. *In re
 Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA 1979).
 

**II.** **DISPOSAL OF PROTOTYPES**Where a prototype of an invention has been disposed of by an
 inventor before the critical date, inquiry by the examiner should focus upon
 the intent of the inventor and the reasonableness of the disposal under all
 circumstances. The fact that an otherwise reasonable disposal of a prototype
 involves incidental income is not necessarily fatal. *In re
 Dybel,* 524 F.2d 1393, 1399, n.5, 187 USPQ 593, 597 n.5 (CCPA
 1975). However, if a prototype is considered "complete" by an inventor and all
 experimentation on the underlying invention has ceased, unrestricted disposal
 of the prototype constitutes a bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *In re Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 113 USPQ 289 (CCPA 1957);

The courts have considered a number of factors in determining
 whether a claimed invention was the subject of a commercial offer for sale
 primarily for purposes of experimentation. "These factors include: (1) the
 necessity for public testing, (2) the amount of control over the experiment
 retained by the inventor, (3) the nature of the invention, (4) the length of the
 test period, (5) whether payment was made, (6) whether there was a secrecy
 obligation, (7) whether records of the experiment were kept, (8) who conducted the
 experiment, ... (9) the degree of commercial exploitation during testing[,] ...
 (10) whether the invention reasonably requires evaluation under actual conditions
 of use, (11) whether testing was systematically performed, (12) whether the
 inventor continually monitored the invention during testing, and (13) the nature
 of contacts made with potential customers." *Allen Eng’g Corp. v. Bartell
 Indus., Inc.,* 299 F.3d 1336, 1353, 63 USPQ2d 1769, 1780 (Fed. Cir.
 2002) (quoting *EZ Dock v. Schafer Sys., Inc.,* 276 F.3d 1347,
 1357, 61 USPQ2d 1289, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2002)) (Linn, J., concurring). Another
 critical attribute of experimentation is the "customer’s awareness of the
 purported testing in the context of a sale." *Electromotive Div. of Gen.
 Motors Corp. v. Transportation Sys. Div. of Gen. Elec. Co.,* 417 F.3d
 1203, 1241, 75 USPQ2d 1650, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
 


Once alleged experimental activity is advanced by an applicant to
 explain a *prima facie* case under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the examiner must determine whether the scope and
 length of the activity were reasonable in terms of the experimental purpose
 intended by the applicant and the nature of the subject matter involved. No one
 of, or particular combination of, factors is necessarily determinative of this
 purpose.

**THE INVENTOR MUST MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER THE INVENTION DURING
 TESTING BY THIRD PARTIES**The significant determinative factors in questions of
 experimental purpose are the extent of supervision and control maintained by an
 inventor over an invention during an alleged period of experimentation , and
 the customer’s awareness of the experimentation. *Electromotive Div. of
 Gen. Motors Corp. v. Transportation Sys. Div. of Gen. Elec. Co.,*
 417 F.3d 1203, 1214,75 USPQ2d 1650, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2005)("control and customer
 awareness ordinarily must be proven if experimentation is to be found"). Once a
 period of experimental activity has ended and supervision and control has been
 relinquished by an inventor without any restraints on subsequent use of an
 invention, an unrestricted subsequent use of the invention is a

 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100

 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §

 to those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)**

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**I.** **DEVELOPMENTAL TESTING IS PERMITTED**Testing of an invention in the normal context of its
 technological development is generally within the realm of permitted
 experimental activity. Likewise, experimentation to determine utility, as that
 term is applied in **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, may also
 constitute permissible activity. See *General Motors Corp. v. Bendix
 Aviation Corp.,* 123 F. Supp. 506, 521, 102 USPQ 58, 69 (N.D.Ind.
 1954). For example, where an invention relates to a chemical composition with
 no known utility, i.e., a patent application for the composition could not be
 filed (**[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**; **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph), continued testing to find
 utility would likely be permissible under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**,
 absent a sale of the composition or other evidence of commercial exploitation.
 
 

**II.** **MARKET TESTING IS NOT PERMITTED**Experimentation to determine product acceptance, i.e., market
 testing, is typical of a trader’s and not an inventor’s experiment and is thus
 not within the area of permitted experimental activity. *Smith &
 Davis Mfg. Co. v. Mellon,* 58 F. 705, 707 (8th Cir. 1893) Likewise,
 testing of an invention for the benefit of appeasing a customer, or to conduct
 "minor ‘tune up’ procedures not requiring an inventor’s skills, but rather the
 skills of a competent technician," are also not within the exception.
 *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 193-94
 (CCPA 1979).
 

**III.** **EXPERIMENTAL ACTIVITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DESIGN APPLICATIONS**The public use of an ornamental design which is directed
 toward generating consumer interest in the aesthetics of the design is not an
 experimental use. *In re Mann,* 861 F.2d 1581, 8 USPQ2d 2030
 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (display of a wrought iron table at a trade show held to be
 public use). However, "experimentation directed to functional features of a
 product also containing an ornamental design may negate what otherwise would be
 considered a public use within the meaning of **[section
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**." *Tone Brothers, Inc.**v.**Sysco Corp.,* 28 F.3d 1192, 1196, 31 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed.
 Cir. 1994) (A study wherein students evaluated the effect of the functional
 features of a spice container design may be considered an experimental
 use.).

**EXPERIMENTAL USE EXCEPTION IS PERSONAL TO AN APPLICANT**The statutory bars of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 are applicable even though public use or on sale activity is by a party other
 than an applicant. Where an applicant presents evidence of experimental
 activity by such other party, the evidence will not overcome the *prima
 facie* case under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 based upon the activity of such party unless the activity was under the
 supervision and control of the applicant. *In re Hamilton,*
 882 F.2d 1576, 1581, 111 USPQ2d 1890, 1894 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("The experimental
 use doctrine operates in the inventor's favor to allow *the
 inventor* to refine his invention or to assess its value relative
 to the time and expense of prosecuting a patent application. If it is not the
 inventor or someone under his control or ‘surveillance’ who does these things,
 there appears to us no reason why he should be entitled to rely upon them to
 avoid the statute.") (citing *Magnetics, Inc. v. Arnold Engineering
 Co.,* 438 F.2d 72, 74, 168 USPQ 392, 394 (7th Cir.1971)). In other
 words, the experimental use activity exception is personal to an applicant.

# 2133.03(e)(1) Commercial Exploitation [R-08.2017]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §

 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


One policy of the on sale and public use bars is the prevention
 of inventors from exploiting their inventions commercially more than 1 year prior
 to the filing of a patent application. Therefore, if applicant’s precritical date
 activity is a sale or offer for sale that is an attempt at market penetration, a
 patent is barred. Thus, even if there is *bona fide* experimental
 activity, an inventor may not commercially exploit an invention more than 1 year
 prior to the filing date of an application. *In re Theis,* 610
 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA 1979).
 

**I.** **THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY MUST LEGITIMATELY ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
 INVENTION TOWARDS COMPLETION**As the degree of commercial exploitation surrounding
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** activity increases, the burden on an
 applicant to establish clear and convincing evidence of experimental activity
 with respect to a public use becomes more difficult. Where the examiner has
 found a *prima facie* case of a sale or an offer to sell, this
 burden will rarely be met unless clear and convincing necessity for the
 experimentation is established by the applicant. This does not mean, of course,
 that there are no circumstances which would permit alleged experimental
 activity in an atmosphere of commercial exploitation. In certain circumstances,
 even a sale may be necessary to legitimately advance the experimental
 development of an invention if the primary purpose of the sale is experimental.
 *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA
 1979); *Robbins Co. v. Lawrence Mfg. Co.,* 482 F.2d 426, 433,
 178 USPQ 577, 582 (9th Cir. 1973). However, careful scrutiny by the examiner of
 the objective factual circumstances surrounding such a sale is essential. See
 *Ushakoff v. United States,* 327 F.2d 669, 140 USPQ 341
 (Ct.Cl. 1964); *Cloud v. Standard Packaging Corp.,* 376 F.2d
 384, 153 USPQ 317 (7th Cir. 1967). 
 

**II.** **SIGNIFICANT FACTORS INDICATIVE OF "COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION"**As discussed in **[MPEP § 2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)**, a policy
 consideration in questions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 activity is premature "commercial exploitation" of a "completed" or "ready for
 patenting" invention (see **[MPEP § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)**). The extent
 of commercial activity which constitutes **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 "on sale" status depends upon the circumstances of the activity, the basic
 indicator being the subjective intent of the inventor as manifested through
 objective evidence. The following activities should be used by the examiner as
 indicia of this subjective intent:
 


* (A) Preparation of various contemporaneous "commercial"
 documents, e.g., orders, invoices, receipts, delivery schedules, etc.;
* (B) Preparation of price lists *(Akron

 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**I.** **EXPERIMENTAL USE ENDS WHEN THE INVENTION IS ACTUALLY REDUCED TO
 PRACTICE**Experimental use "means perfecting or completing an invention
 to the point of determining that it will work for its intended purpose."
 Therefore, experimental use "ends with an actual reduction to practice."
 *RCA Corp.**v.**Data Gen. Corp.,* 887 F.2d 1056, 1061, 12 USPQ2d 1449, 1453
 (Fed. Cir. 1989). If the examiner concludes from the evidence of record that an
 applicant was satisfied that an invention was in fact "complete," awaiting
 approval by the applicant from an organization such as Underwriters’
 Laboratories will not normally overcome this conclusion. *Interroyal
 Corp. v. Simmons Co.,* 204 USPQ 562, 566 (S.D.N.Y. 1979);
 *Skil Corp. v. Rockwell Manufacturing Co.,* 358 F. Supp.
 1257, 1261, 178 USPQ 562, 565 (N.D.Ill. 1973), *aff’d. in part, rev’d
 in part sub nom.**Skil Corp. v. Lucerne Products Inc.,* 503 F.2d 745, 183 USPQ
 396, 399 (7th Cir. 1974), *cert. denied,* 420 U.S. 974, 185
 USPQ 65 (1975). See **[MPEP § 2133.03(c)](s2133.html#d0e204494)** for more
 information of what constitutes a "complete" invention.
 


The fact that alleged experimental activity does not lead to
 specific modifications or refinements of an invention is evidence, although not
 conclusive evidence, that such activity is not within the realm permitted by
 the statute. This is especially the case where the evidence of record clearly
 demonstrates to the examiner that an invention was considered "complete" by an
 inventor at the time of the activity. Nevertheless, any modifications or
 refinements which did result from such experimental activity must at least be a
 feature of the claimed invention to be of any probative value. *In re
 Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 194 (CCPA 1979).
 

**II.** **DISPOSAL OF PROTOTYPES**Where a prototype of an invention has been disposed of by an
 inventor before the critical date, inquiry by the examiner should focus upon
 the intent of the inventor and the reasonableness of the disposal under all
 circumstances. The fact that an otherwise reasonable disposal of a prototype
 involves incidental income is not necessarily fatal. *In re
 Dybel,* 524 F.2d 1393, 1399, n.5, 187 USPQ 593, 597 n.5 (CCPA
 1975). However, if a prototype is considered "complete" by an inventor and all
 experimentation on the underlying invention has ceased, unrestricted disposal
 of the prototype constitutes a bar under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *In re Blaisdell,* 242 F.2d 779, 113 USPQ 289 (CCPA 1957);

The courts have considered a number of factors in determining
 whether a claimed invention was the subject of a commercial offer for sale
 primarily for purposes of experimentation. "These factors include: (1) the
 necessity for public testing, (2) the amount of control over the experiment
 retained by the inventor, (3) the nature of the invention, (4) the length of the
 test period, (5) whether payment was made, (6) whether there was a secrecy
 obligation, (7) whether records of the experiment were kept, (8) who conducted the
 experiment, ... (9) the degree of commercial exploitation during testing[,] ...
 (10) whether the invention reasonably requires evaluation under actual conditions
 of use, (11) whether testing was systematically performed, (12) whether the
 inventor continually monitored the invention during testing, and (13) the nature
 of contacts made with potential customers." *Allen Eng’g Corp. v. Bartell
 Indus., Inc.,* 299 F.3d 1336, 1353, 63 USPQ2d 1769, 1780 (Fed. Cir.
 2002) (quoting *EZ Dock v. Schafer Sys., Inc.,* 276 F.3d 1347,
 1357, 61 USPQ2d 1289, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2002)) (Linn, J., concurring). Another
 critical attribute of experimentation is the "customer’s awareness of the
 purported testing in the context of a sale." *Electromotive Div. of Gen.
 Motors Corp. v. Transportation Sys. Div. of Gen. Elec. Co.,* 417 F.3d
 1203, 1241, 75 USPQ2d 1650, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

 explain a *prima facie* case under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the examiner must determine whether the scope and
 length of the activity were reasonable in terms of the experimental purpose
 intended by the applicant and the nature of the subject matter involved. No one
 of, or particular combination of, factors is necessarily determinative of this
 purpose.

**THE INVENTOR MUST MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER THE INVENTION DURING
 TESTING BY THIRD PARTIES**The significant determinative factors in questions of
 experimental purpose are the extent of supervision and control maintained by an
 inventor over an invention during an alleged period of experimentation , and
 the customer’s awareness of the experimentation. *Electromotive Div. of
 Gen. Motors Corp. v. Transportation Sys. Div. of Gen. Elec. Co.,*
 417 F.3d 1203, 1214,75 USPQ2d 1650, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2005)("control and customer
 awareness ordinarily must be proven if experimentation is to be found"). Once a
 period of experimental activity has ended and supervision and control has been
 relinquished by an inventor without any restraints on subsequent use of an
 invention, an unrestricted subsequent use of the invention is a
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bar. *In re Blaisdell,*

# 2133.03(e)(6) Permitted Experimental Activity and Testing [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section has **limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject
 to those provisions. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(c) through (e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)**
 for a detailed discussion of the public use and on sale provisions of
 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**I.** **DEVELOPMENTAL TESTING IS PERMITTED**Testing of an invention in the normal context of its
 technological development is generally within the realm of permitted
 experimental activity. Likewise, experimentation to determine utility, as that
 term is applied in **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, may also
 constitute permissible activity. See *General Motors Corp. v. Bendix
 Aviation Corp.,* 123 F. Supp. 506, 521, 102 USPQ 58, 69 (N.D.Ind.
 1954). For example, where an invention relates to a chemical composition with
 no known utility, i.e., a patent application for the composition could not be
 filed (**[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**; **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph), continued testing to find
 utility would likely be permissible under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**,
 absent a sale of the composition or other evidence of commercial exploitation.
 
 

**II.** **MARKET TESTING IS NOT PERMITTED**Experimentation to determine product acceptance, i.e., market
 testing, is typical of a trader’s and not an inventor’s experiment and is thus
 not within the area of permitted experimental activity. *Smith &
 Davis Mfg. Co. v. Mellon,* 58 F. 705, 707 (8th Cir. 1893) Likewise,
 testing of an invention for the benefit of appeasing a customer, or to conduct
 "minor ‘tune up’ procedures not requiring an inventor’s skills, but rather the
 skills of a competent technician," are also not within the exception.
 *In re Theis,* 610 F.2d 786, 793, 204 USPQ 188, 193-94
 (CCPA 1979).
 

**III.** **EXPERIMENTAL ACTIVITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DESIGN APPLICATIONS**The public use of an ornamental design which is directed
 toward generating consumer interest in the aesthetics of the design is not an
 experimental use. *In re Mann,* 861 F.2d 1581, 8 USPQ2d 2030
 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (display of a wrought iron table at a trade show held to be
 public use). However, "experimentation directed to functional features of a
 product also containing an ornamental design may negate what otherwise would be
 considered a public use within the meaning of **[section
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**." *Tone Brothers, Inc.**v.**Sysco Corp.,* 28 F.3d 1192, 1196, 31 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed.
 Cir. 1994) (A study wherein students evaluated the effect of the functional
 features of a spice container design may be considered an experimental
 use.).

 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100

 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject

 **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*

**EXPERIMENTAL USE EXCEPTION IS PERSONAL TO AN APPLICANT**The statutory bars of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 are applicable even though public use or on sale activity is by a party other
 than an applicant. Where an applicant presents evidence of experimental
 activity by such other party, the evidence will not overcome the *prima
 facie* case under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 based upon the activity of such party unless the activity was under the
 supervision and control of the applicant. *In re Hamilton,*
 882 F.2d 1576, 1581, 111 USPQ2d 1890, 1894 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("The experimental
 use doctrine operates in the inventor's favor to allow *the
 inventor* to refine his invention or to assess its value relative
 to the time and expense of prosecuting a patent application. If it is not the
 inventor or someone under his control or ‘surveillance’ who does these things,
 there appears to us no reason why he should be entitled to rely upon them to
 avoid the statute.") (citing *Magnetics, Inc. v. Arnold Engineering
 Co.,* 438 F.2d 72, 74, 168 USPQ 392, 394 (7th Cir.1971)). In other
 words, the experimental use activity exception is personal to an applicant.
