# 2173 Claims Must Particularly Point Out and Distinctly Claim the
 Invention [R-10.2019]


 Optimizing patent quality by providing clear notice to the
 public of the boundaries of the inventive subject matter protected by a patent grant
 fosters innovation and competitiveness. Accordingly, providing high quality patents is one
 of the agency’s guiding principles. The Office recognizes that issuing patents with clear
 and definite claim language is a key component to enhancing the quality of patents and
 raising confidence in the patent process. 
 


**[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph
 requires that a patent application specification shall conclude with one or more claims
 particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or
 a joint inventor regards as the invention. (Note that although **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, uses the phrase "which applicant regards as his
 invention,"**[pre‑AIA 37
 CFR 1.41(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317674)** provides that a patent is applied for in the name or
 names of the actual inventor or inventors.) In patent examining parlance, the claim
 language must be "definite" to comply with**[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. Conversely, a claim that does not comply with
 this requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph is "indefinite." 
 


The primary purpose of this requirement of definiteness of claim language
 is to ensure that the scope of the claims is clear so the public is informed of the
 boundaries of what constitutes infringement of the patent. A secondary purpose is to
 provide a clear measure of what the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention
 so that it can be determined whether the claimed invention meets all the criteria for
 patentability and whether the specification meets the criteria of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph
 with respect to the claimed invention.
 


 It is of utmost importance that patents issue with definite
 claims that clearly and precisely inform persons skilled in the art of the boundaries of
 protected subject matter. Therefore, claims that do not meet this standard must be rejected
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph
 as indefinite. Such a rejection requires that the applicant respond by explaining why the
 language is definite or by amending the claim, thus making the record clear regarding the
 claim boundaries prior to issuance. As an indefiniteness rejection requires the applicant
 to respond by explaining why the language is definite or by amending the claim, such
 rejections must clearly identify the language that causes the claim to be indefinite and
 thoroughly explain the reasoning for the rejection.
 



# 2173.01 Interpreting the Claims [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the
 relevant date is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the
 "time of the invention," which is only applicable to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*


A fundamental principle contained in **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is that applicants are their own lexicographers. They can define in the claims
 what the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention essentially in whatever
 terms they choose so long as any special meaning assigned to a term is clearly set forth
 in the specification. See **[MPEP § 2111.01.](s2111.html#d0e200409)** Applicant may use functional language,
 alternative expressions, negative limitations, or any style of expression or format of
 claim which makes clear the boundaries of the subject matter for which protection is
 sought. As noted by the court in *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 160
 USPQ 226 (CCPA 1971), a claim may not be rejected solely because of the type of language
 used to define the subject matter for which patent protection is sought.
 

**I.** **BROADEST REASONABLE INTERPRETATION**The first step to examining a claim to determine if
 the language is definite is to fully understand the subject matter of the invention
 disclosed in the application and to ascertain the boundaries of that subject matter
 encompassed by the claim. During examination, a claim must be given its broadest
 reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification as it would be
 interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art. Because the applicant has the
 opportunity to amend claims during prosecution, giving a claim its broadest
 reasonable interpretation will reduce the possibility that the claim, once issued,
 will be interpreted more broadly than is justified. In re
 *Yamamoto,* 740 F.2d 1569, 1571, 222 USPQ 934, 936 (Fed. Cir.
 1984); *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed.
 Cir. 1989) ("During patent examination the pending claims must be interpreted as
 broadly as their terms reasonably allow."). The focus of the inquiry regarding the
 meaning of a claim should be what would be reasonable from the perspective of one of
 ordinary skill in the art. *In re Suitco Surface, Inc.,* 603 F.3d
 1255, 1260, 94 USPQ2D 1640, 1644 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *In re Buszard,*
 504 F.3d 1364, 84 USPQ2d 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In *Buszard,* the
 claim was directed to a flame retardant composition comprising a flexible
 polyurethane foam reaction mixture. *Buszard,* 504 F.3d at 1365, 84
 USPQ2d at 1749. The Federal Circuit found that the Board’s interpretation that
 equated a "flexible" foam with a crushed "rigid" foam was not reasonable.
 *Id.* at 1367, 84 USPQ2d at 1751. Persuasive argument was
 presented that persons experienced in the field of polyurethane foams know that a
 flexible mixture is different than a rigid foam mixture. *Id.* at
 1366, 84 USPQ2d at 1751. See **[MPEP § 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** for a full discussion of
 broadest reasonable interpretation. 
 


Under a broadest reasonable interpretation, words of
 the claim must be given their plain meaning, unless such meaning is inconsistent with
 the specification. The plain meaning of a term means the ordinary and customary
 meaning given to the term by those of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
 invention. The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced by a variety
 of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the specification,
 drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the meaning of a
 claim term is the specification - the greatest clarity is obtained when the
 specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. The presumption that a term
 is given its ordinary and customary meaning may be rebutted by the applicant by
 clearly setting forth a different definition of the term in the specification.
 *In re Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed.
 Cir. 1997) (the USPTO looks to the ordinary use of the claim terms taking into
 account definitions or other "enlightenment" contained in the written description);
 But c.f. *In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr.,* 367 F.3d 1359, 1369,
 70 USPQ2d 1827, 1834 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("We have cautioned against reading limitations
 into a claim from the preferred embodiment described in the specification, even if it
 is the only embodiment described, absent clear disclaimer in the specification.");
 *In re Bigio,* 381 F.3d 1320, 1325, 72 USPQ2d 1209, 1211 (Fed.
 Cir. 2004) (The claims at issue were drawn to a "hair brush." The court upheld the
 Board’s refusal to import from the specification a limitation that would apply the
 term only to hairbrushes for the scalp. "[T]his court counsels the PTO to avoid the
 temptation to limit broad claim terms solely on the basis of specification
 passages."). When the specification sets a clear path to the claim language, the
 scope of the claims is more easily determined and the public notice function of the
 claims is best served. See **[MPEP § 2111.01](s2111.html#d0e200409)** for a full discussion
 of the plain meaning of claim language.
 


If an Office action has issued where the plain
 meaning of the claim terms was used, applicant may point out that the term has been
 given a special definition. Since there is a presumption that claim terms are given
 their plain meaning, and the use of special definitions is an exception, the
 applicant must point to where the specification as filed provides a clear and
 intentional use of a special definition for the claim term to be treated as having a
 special definition.
 


An applicant may not add a special definition or
 disavowal after the filing date of the application. However, an applicant may point
 out or explain in remarks where the specification as filed contains a special
 definition or disavowal. 
 

**II.** **DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT EACH CLAIM LIMITATION INVOKES 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or
 Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph** As part of the claim interpretation analysis,
 examiners should determine whether each limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph or not. If the claim limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, the claim limitation must "be construed to cover the corresponding
 structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof."
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph; see also *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29
 USPQ2d 1845, 1849 (Fed. Cir. 1994) *(en banc)* ("[W]e hold that
 paragraph six applies regardless of the context in which the interpretation of
 means-plus-function language arises, i.e., whether as part of a patentability
 determination in the PTO or as part of a validity or infringement determination in a
 court."). See **[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection I. for more information regarding the
 determination of whether a limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, and means- (or step-) plus- function claim limitations. 
 




# 2173.02 Determining Whether Claim Language is Definite [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the
 relevant date is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the
 "time the invention was made," which is only applicable to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*


 During prosecution, applicant has an opportunity and a
 duty to amend ambiguous claims to clearly and precisely define the metes and bounds of
 the claimed invention. The claim places the public on notice of the scope of the
 patentee’s right to exclude. See, e.g., *Johnson & Johnston Assoc. Inc. v.
 R.E. Serv. Co.,* 285 F.3d 1046, 1052, 62 USPQ2d 1225, 1228 (Fed. Cir. 2002)
 *(en banc)*. As the Federal Circuit stated in *Halliburton
 Energy Servs., Inc. v. M-I LLC,* 514 F.3d 1244, 1255, 85 USPQ2d 1654, 1663
 (Fed. Cir. 2008):

 A decision on whether a claim is indefinite under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph requires a determination of whether those skilled in the art would understand
 what is claimed when the claim is read in light of the specification.
 *Power-One, Inc. v. Artesyn Techs., Inc.,* 599 F.3d 1343, 1350, 94
 USPQ2d 1241, 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *Orthokinetics, Inc. v. Safety Travel
 Chairs,* Inc., 806 F.2d 1565, 1 USPQ2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In
 *Orthokinetics,* a claim directed to a wheel chair included the
 phrase "so dimensioned as to be insertable through the space between the doorframe of an
 automobile and one of the seats thereof." 806 F.2d at 1568, 1 USPQ2d at 1082. The court
 found the phrase to be as accurate as the subject matter permits, since automobiles are
 of various sizes. *Id.* at 1576, 1 USPQ2d at 1088. "As long as those of
 ordinary skill in the art realized the dimensions could be easily obtained,
 **[§
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, 2d para. requires nothing more." *Id.* Claim
 terms are typically given their ordinary and customary meaning as understood by one of
 ordinary skill in the pertinent art, and the generally understood meaning of particular
 terms may vary from art to art. Therefore, it is important to analyze claim terms in
 view of the application’s specification from the perspective of those skilled in the
 relevant art since a particular term used in one patent or application may not have the
 same meaning when used in a different application. *Medrad, Inc. v. MRI Devices
 Corp.,* 401 F.3d 1313, 1318, 74 USPQ2d 1184, 1188 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
 

**I.** **CLAIMS UNDER EXAMINATION ARE CONSTRUED DIFFERENTLY THAN PATENTED CLAIMS** Patented claims are not given the broadest reasonable
 interpretation during court proceedings involving infringement and validity, and can
 be interpreted based on a fully developed prosecution record. While "absolute
 precision is unattainable" in patented claims, the definiteness requirement "mandates
 clarity." *Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc.,* 527 U.S.
 \_\_\_\_, 110 USPQ2d 1688, 1693 (2014). A court will not find a patented claim indefinite
 unless the claim interpreted in light of the specification and the prosecution
 history fails to "inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention
 with reasonable certainty." *Id.* at 1689.
 


The Office does not interpret claims when examining
 patent applications in the same manner as the courts. *In re
 Packard,* 751 F.3d 1307, 1312, 110 USPQ2d 1785, 1788 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
 *In re Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed.
 Cir. 1997); *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 321-22, 13 USPQ2d 1320,
 1321-22 (Fed. Cir. 1989). The Office construes claims by giving them their broadest
 reasonable interpretation during prosecution in an effort to establish a clear record
 of what the applicant intends to claim. Such claim construction during prosecution
 may effectively result in a lower threshold for ambiguity than a court's
 determination. *Packard*, 751 F.3d at 1323-24, 110 USPQ2d at 1796-97
 (Plager, J., concurring). However, applicant has the ability to amend the claims
 during prosecution to ensure that the meaning of the language is clear and definite
 prior to issuance or provide a persuasive explanation (with evidence as necessary)
 that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not consider the claim language
 unclear. *In re Buszard,* 504 F.3d 1364, 1366, 84 USPQ2d 1749, 1750
 (Fed. Cir. 2007)(claims are given their broadest reasonable interpretation during
 prosecution "to facilitate sharpening and clarifying the claims at the application
 stage"); see also *In re Yamamoto,* 740 F.2d 1569, 1571, 222 USPQ
 934, 936 (Fed. Cir. 1984); *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 322, 13
 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989); *Ex parte McAward,* Appeal
 2015-006416 (PTAB Aug. 25, 2017) (precedential). 
 


 See **[MPEP § 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)***et seq.* for a detailed discussion of claim interpretation during
 the examination process. The lower threshold is also applied because the patent
 record is in development and not fixed during examination, and the agency does not
 rely on it for interpreting claims. *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1325
 (Plager, J., concurring). *Burlington Indus. Inc. v. Quigg,* 822
 F.2d 1581, 1583, 3 USPQ2d 1436, 1438 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("Issues of judicial claim
 construction such as arise after patent issuance, for example during infringement
 litigation, have no place in prosecution of pending claims before the PTO, when any
 ambiguity or excessive breadth may be corrected by merely changing the claim.").
 


During examination, after applying the broadest
 reasonable interpretation to the claim, if the metes and bounds of the claimed
 invention are not clear, the claim is indefinite and should be rejected.
 *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1310 ("[W]hen the USPTO has initially
 issued a well-grounded rejection that identifies ways in which language in a claim is
 ambiguous, vague, incoherent, opaque, or otherwise unclear in describing and defining
 the claimed invention, and thereafter the applicant fails to provide a satisfactory
 response, the USPTO can properly reject the claim as failing to meet the statutory
 requirements of **[§ 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**.");
 *Zletz,* 893 F.2d at 322, 13 USPQ2d at 1322. For example, if the
 language of a claim, given its broadest reasonable interpretation, is such that a
 person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would read it with more than one
 reasonable interpretation, then a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is appropriate. Examiners, however, are cautioned against confusing claim
 breadth with claim indefiniteness. A broad claim is not indefinite merely because it
 encompasses a wide scope of subject matter provided the scope is clearly defined.
 Instead, a claim is indefinite when the boundaries of the protected subject matter
 are not clearly delineated and the scope is unclear. For example, a genus claim that
 covers multiple species is broad, but is not indefinite because of its breadth, which
 is otherwise clear. But a genus claim that could be interpreted in such a way that it
 is not clear which species are covered would be indefinite (e.g., because there is
 more than one reasonable interpretation of what species are included in the claim).
 See **[MPEP §
 2173.05(h)](s2173.html#d0e218467)**, subsection I., for more information regarding
 the determination of whether a Markush claim satisfies the requirements of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 

**II.** **THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS OF CLARITY AND PRECISION**The examiner’s focus during examination of claims for compliance
 with the requirement for definiteness of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is whether the claim meets the threshold requirements of clarity and
 precision set forth in the statute, not whether more suitable language or modes of
 expression are available. When the examiner is satisfied that patentable subject
 matter is disclosed, and it is apparent to the examiner that the claims are directed
 to such patentable subject matter, the examiner should allow claims which define the
 patentable subject matter with the required degree of particularity and distinctness.
 Some latitude in the manner of expression and the aptness of terms should be
 permitted so long as **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, is satisfied. Examiners are
 encouraged to suggest claim language to applicants to improve the clarity or
 precision of the language used, but should not insist on their own preferences if
 other modes of expression selected by applicants satisfy the statutory
 requirement.
 


The essential inquiry pertaining to this requirement is whether the
 claims set out and circumscribe a particular subject matter with a reasonable degree
 of clarity and particularity. "As the statutory language of ‘particular[ity]' and
 'distinct[ness]' indicates, claims are required to be cast in clear—as opposed to
 ambiguous, vague, indefinite—terms. It is the claims that notify the public of what
 is within the protections of the patent, and what is not."
 *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1313. Definiteness of claim language must
 be analyzed, not in a vacuum, but in light of:
 


* (A) The content of the particular application disclosure;
* (B) The teachings of the prior art; and
* (C) The claim interpretation that would be given by one possessing
 the ordinary level of skill in the pertinent art at the time the invention was
 made.


In reviewing a claim for compliance with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, the examiner must consider the claim as a whole to determine whether the
 claim apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves
 the notice function required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, by providing clear warning to
 others as to what constitutes infringement of the patent. See, e.g., *Solomon
 v. Kimberly-Clark Corp.,* 216 F.3d 1372, 1379, 55 USPQ2d 1279, 1283 (Fed.
 Cir. 2000). See also *In re Larsen,* 10 Fed. App'x 890 (Fed. Cir.
 2001) (The preamble of the *Larsen* claim recited only a hanger and
 a loop but the body of the claim positively recited a linear member. The court
 observed that the totality of all the limitations of the claim and their interaction
 with each other must be considered to ascertain the inventor’s contribution to the
 art. Upon review of the claim in its entirety, the court concluded that the claim at
 issue apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves
 the notice function required by **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**.).
 


If the language of the claim is such that a person of ordinary skill
 in the art could not interpret the metes and bounds of the claim so as to understand
 how to avoid infringement, a rejection of the claim under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is appropriate. See *Morton Int’l, Inc. v. Cardinal Chem.
 Co.,* 5 F.3d 1464, 1470, 28 USPQ2d 1190, 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1993). However,
 if the language used by applicant satisfies the statutory requirements of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, the claim must not be rejected under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. 
 


Examiners should note that Office policy is not to employ
 *per se* rules to make technical rejections. Examples of claim
 language which have been held to be indefinite set forth in **[MPEP § 2173.05(d)](s2173.html#d0e218251)**
 are fact specific and should not be applied as *per
 se* rules. 
 

**III.** **RESOLVING INDEFINITE CLAIM LANGUAGE*** 

***A.******Examiner Must Establish a Clear Record***Examiners are urged to carefully carry out their
 responsibilities to see that the application file contains a complete and accurate
 picture of the Office’s consideration of the patentability of an application. See
 **[MPEP §
 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection I. In order to provide a complete
 application file history and to enhance the clarity of the prosecution history
 record, an examiner should provide clear explanations of all actions taken during
 prosecution of the application. See **[MPEP § 707.07(f)](s707.html#d0e74734)**. Thus, when a
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, is appropriate based on the
 examiner’s determination that a claim term or phrase is *prima
 facie* indefinite, the examiner should clearly communicate in an
 Office action any findings and reasons which support the rejection and avoid a
 mere conclusion that the claim term or phrase is indefinite. See
 **[MPEP §
 706.03](s706.html#d0e66074)** and **[MPEP § 707.07(g)](s707.html#d0e75512)**.
 


**[MPEP §
 2173.05](s2173.html#d0e217809)** provides numerous examples of rationales that
 may support a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, such as functional claim
 limitations, relative terminology/terms of degree, lack of antecedent basis, etc.
 Only by providing a complete explanation in the Office action as to the basis for
 determining why a particular term or phrase used in the claim is "vague and
 indefinite" will the examiner enhance the clarity of the prosecution history
 record. 
 

***B.******An Office Action Should Provide a Sufficient Explanation***The Office action must set forth the specific term
 or phrase that is indefinite and why the metes and bounds are unclear. Since a
 rejection requires the applicant to respond by explaining why claim language would
 be recognized by a person of ordinary skill in the art as definite or by amending
 the claim, the Office action should provide enough information for the applicant
 to prepare a meaningful response. "Because claims delineate the patentee’s right
 to exclude, the patent statute requires that the scope of the claims be
 sufficiently definite to inform the public of the bounds of the protected
 invention, i.e., what subject matter is covered by the exclusive rights of the
 patent." *Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v. M-I LLC,* 514 F.3d
 1244, 1249, 85 USPQ2d 1654, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Thus, claims are given their
 broadest reasonable interpretation during prosecution "to facilitate sharpening
 and clarifying the claims at the application stage" when claims are readily
 changed. *In re Buszard,* 504 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2007);
 see also *In re Yamamoto,* 740 F.2d 1569, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1984);
 *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 322, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed.
 Cir. 1989). 
 


To comply with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, applicants are required to make the terms that are used to define the
 invention clear and precise, so that the metes and bounds of the subject matter
 that will be protected by the patent grant can be ascertained. See
 **[MPEP §
 2173.05(a)](s2173.html#d0e217839)**, subsection I. It is important that a person
 of ordinary skill in the art be able to interpret the metes and bounds of the
 claims so as to understand how to avoid infringement of the patent that ultimately
 issues from the application being examined. See **[MPEP § 2173.02](s2173.html#d0e217598)**,
 subsection II (citing *Morton Int ’l, Inc. v. Cardinal Chem.
 Co.,* 5 F.3d 1464, 1470 (Fed. Cir. 1993)); see also
 *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1249, 85 USPQ2d at
 1658 ("Otherwise, competitors cannot avoid infringement, defeating the public
 notice function of patent claims."). Examiners should bear in mind that "[a]n
 essential purpose of patent examination is to fashion claims that are precise,
 clear, correct, and unambiguous. Only in this way can uncertainties of claim scope
 be removed, as much as possible, during the administrative process."
 *Zletz,* 893 F.2d at 322, 13 USPQ2d at 1322. 
 


Accordingly, when rejecting a claim as
 *prima facie* indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, the examiner should provide enough information in the Office action to
 permit applicant to make a meaningful response, as the indefiniteness rejection
 requires the applicant to explain or provide evidence as to why the claim language
 is not indefinite or amend the claim. For example, in making a *prima
 facie* case of indefiniteness, the examiner should point out the
 specific term or phrase that is indefinite, explain in detail why such term or
 phrase renders the metes and bounds of the claim scope unclear and, whenever
 practicable, indicate how the indefiniteness issues may be resolved to overcome
 the rejection. See **[MPEP § 707.07(d)](s707.html#d0e74673)**. If the applicant does not adequately
 respond to the *prima facie* case, the examiner may make the
 indefiniteness rejection final. *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1312.
 


The focus during the examination of claims for
 compliance with the requirement for definiteness under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is whether the claim meets the threshold requirements of clarity and
 precision, not whether more suitable language or modes of expression are
 available. See **[MPEP
 § 2173.02](s2173.html#d0e217598)**, subsection II. Examiners are encouraged to
 suggest claim language to applicants to improve the clarity or precision of the
 language used, but should not insist on their own preferences if other modes of
 expression selected by applicants satisfy the statutory requirement. Furthermore,
 when the examiner determines that more information is necessary to ascertain the
 meaning of a claim term, a requirement for information under **[37 CFR 1.105](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322262)**
 may be appropriate. See **[MPEP § 704.10](s704.html#d0e55758)** regarding
 requirements for information. 
 


It is highly desirable to have applicants resolve
 ambiguity by amending the claims during prosecution of the application rather than
 attempting to resolve the ambiguity in subsequent litigation of the issued patent.
 *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255. Thus, in
 response to an examiner’s rejection for indefiniteness, an applicant may resolve
 the ambiguity by amending the claim, or by providing a persuasive explanation on
 the record that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would not consider
 the claim language unclear. *In re Packard,* 751 F.3d 1307, 1311
 (Fed. Cir. 2014). For the latter option, in some cases, it may be necessary for
 the applicant to provide a separate definition (such as from an art-recognized
 dictionary) to show how the ordinarily-skilled artisan would have understood the
 claim language at issue. *Id.*


If the examiner considers applicant’s arguments
 and/or amendments to be persuasive, the examiner should indicate in the next
 Office communication that the previous rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, has been withdrawn and provide an explanation as to what prompted the
 change in the examiner’s position (e.g., by making specific reference to portions
 of applicant’s remarks). 
 


By providing an explanation as to the action taken, the examiner
 will enhance the clarity of the prosecution history record. As noted by the
 Supreme Court in *Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki
 Co.,* 535 U.S. 722, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 1838, 62 USPQ2d 1705, 1710 (2002),
 a clear and complete prosecution file record is important in that "[p]rosecution
 history estoppel requires that the claims of a patent be interpreted in light of
 the proceedings in the PTO during the application process." In
 *Festo,* the Court held that "a narrowing amendment made to
 satisfy any requirement of the Patent Act may give rise to an estoppel." With
 respect to amendments made to comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, the Court stated that "[i]f a **[§ 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**
 amendment is truly cosmetic, then it would not narrow the patent’s scope or raise
 an estoppel. On the other hand, if a **[§ 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** amendment is necessary
 and narrows the patent’s scope—even if only for the purpose of better
 description—estoppel may apply." *Id.* at 1840, 62 USPQ2d at
 1712. The Court further stated that "when the court is unable to determine the
 purpose underlying a narrowing amendment—and hence a rationale for limiting the
 estoppel to the surrender of particular equivalents—the court should presume that
 the patentee surrendered all subject matter between the broader and the narrower
 language…the patentee should bear the burden of showing that the amendment does
 not surrender the particular equivalent in question." *Id.* at
 1842, 62 USPQ2d at 1713. Thus, whenever possible, the examiner should make the
 record clear by providing explicit reasoning for making or withdrawing any
 rejection related to **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph.
 

***C.******Provide Claim Interpretation in Reasons for Allowance When Record is
 Unclear***Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.104(e)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322253)**, if the
 examiner believes that the record of the prosecution as a whole does not make
 clear the reasons for allowing a claim or claims, the examiner may set forth such
 reasoning in reasons for allowance. Further, prior to allowance, the examiner may
 also specify allowable subject matter and provide reasons for indicating such
 allowable subject matter in an Office communication. See **[MPEP § 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**,
 subsection I. One of the primary purposes of **[37 CFR 1.104(e)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322253)** is to improve
 the quality and reliability of issued patents by providing a complete file history
 which should clearly reflect the reasons why the application was allowed. Such
 information facilitates evaluation of the scope and strength of a patent by the
 patentee and the public and may help avoid or simplify subsequent litigation of an
 issued patent. See **[MPEP § 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection I. In meeting the need for
 the application file history to speak for itself, it is incumbent upon the
 examiner in exercising their responsibility to the public to see that the file
 history is complete. See **[MPEP § 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection I. 
 


For example, when allowing a claim based on a claim
 interpretation which might not be readily apparent from the record of the
 prosecution as a whole, the examiner should set forth in reasons for allowance the
 claim interpretation applied in determining that the claim is allowable over the
 prior art. See **[MPEP
 § 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection II.G. This is especially the case
 where the application is allowed after an interview. The examiner should ensure,
 however, that statements of reasons for allowance do not place unwarranted
 interpretations, whether broad or narrow, upon the claims. See
 **[MPEP §
 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection I. 
 

***D.******Open Lines of Communication with the Applicant – When Indefiniteness
 Is the Only Issue, Attempt Resolution through an Interview before Resorting
 to a Rejection***Examiners are reminded that interviews can be an
 effective examination tool and are encouraged to initiate an interview with the
 applicant or applicant’s representative at any point during the pendency of an
 application, if the interview can help further prosecution, shorten pendency, or
 provide a benefit to the examiner or applicant. Issues of claim interpretation and
 clarity of scope may lend themselves to resolution through an examiner interview.
 For example, the examiner may initiate an interview to discuss, among other
 issues, the broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim, the meaning of a
 particular claim limitation, and the scope and clarity of preamble language,
 functional language, intended use language, and means-plus-function limitations,
 etc. 
 


An interview can serve to develop and clarify such
 issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant,
 potentially eliminating the need for the examiner to resort to making a rejection
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. The examiner is reminded that the substance of any interview, whether
 in person, by video conference, or by telephone must be made of record in the
 application, whether or not an agreement was reached at the interview. See
 **[MPEP §
 713.04](s713.html#d0e84595)**; see also **[37 CFR 1.2](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313151)** ("The action of the
 Patent and Trademark Office will be based exclusively on the written record in the
 Office. No attention will be paid to any alleged oral promise, stipulation, or
 understanding in relation to which there is disagreement or doubt."). Examples of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** issues that should be made of record after the interview
 include: why the discussed claim term is or is not sufficiently clear; why the
 discussed claim term is or is not inconsistent with the specification; why the
 discussed claim term does or does not invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph (and if it does, the identification of corresponding structure,
 material, or acts in the specification for a **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph limitation); and any claim amendments discussed that would resolve
 identified ambiguities. 
 




# 2173.03 Correspondence Between Specification and Claims [R-08.2017]


The specification should ideally serve as a glossary to the claim terms
 so that the examiner and the public can clearly ascertain the meaning of the claim
 terms. Correspondence between the specification and claims is required by
 **[37 CFR
 1.75(d)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320296)**, which provides that claim terms must find clear
 support or antecedent basis in the specification so that the meaning of the terms may be
 ascertainable by reference to the specification. Glossaries of terms used in the claims
 are a helpful device for ensuring adequate definition of terms used in claims. If the
 specification does not provide the needed support or antecedent basis for the claim
 terms, the specification should be objected to under **[37 CFR 1.75(d)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320296)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 608.01(o)](s608.html#d0e46173)** and **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection IV. Applicant
 will be required to make appropriate amendment to the description to provide clear
 support or antecedent basis for the claim terms provided no new matter is introduced, or
 amend the claim. 
 


A claim, although clear on its face, may also be
 indefinite when a conflict or inconsistency between the claimed subject matter and the
 specification disclosure renders the scope of the claim uncertain as inconsistency with
 the specification disclosure or prior art teachings may make an otherwise definite claim
 take on an unreasonable degree of uncertainty. *In re Moore,* 439 F.2d
 1232, 1235-36, 169 USPQ 236, 239 (CCPA 1971); *In re Cohn,* 438 F.2d
 989, 169 USPQ 95 (CCPA 1971); *In re**Hammack,* 427 F.2d 1378, 166 USPQ 204 (CCPA 1970). For example, a
 claim with a limitation of "the clamp means including a clamp body and first and second
 clamping members, the clamping members being supported by the clamp body" was determined
 to be indefinite because the terms "first and second clamping members" and "clamp body"
 were found to be vague in light of the specification which showed no "clamp member"
 structure being "supported by the clamp body." *In re Anderson,* 1997
 U.S. App. Lexis 167 (Fed. Cir. January 6, 1997) (unpublished). In
 *Cohn,* a claim was directed to a process of treating an aluminum
 surface with an alkali silicate solution and included a further limitation that the
 surface has an "opaque" appearance. *Id.* The specification, meanwhile,
 associated the use of an alkali silicate with a glazed or porcelain-like finish, which
 the specification distinguished from an opaque finish. *Cohn,* 438 F.2d
 at 993. Noting that no claim may be read apart from and independent of the supporting
 disclosure on which it is based, the court found that the claim was internally
 inconsistent based on the description, definitions and examples set forth in the
 specification relating to the appearance of the surface after treatment, and therefore
 indefinite. *Id.*




# 2173.04 Breadth Is Not Indefiniteness [R-10.2019]


Breadth of a claim is not to be equated with indefiniteness.
 *In re**Miller,* 441 F.2d 689, 169 USPQ 597 (CCPA 1971); *In re
 Gardner,* 427 F.2d 786, 788, 166 USPQ 138, 140 (CCPA 1970) ("Breadth is not
 indefiniteness."). A broad claim is not indefinite merely because it encompasses a wide
 scope of subject matter provided the scope is clearly defined. But a claim is indefinite
 when the boundaries of the protected subject matter are not clearly delineated and the
 scope is unclear. For example, a genus claim that covers multiple species is broad, but
 is not indefinite because of its breadth, which is otherwise clear. But a genus claim
 that could be interpreted in such a way that it is not clear which species are covered
 would be indefinite (e.g., because there is more than one reasonable interpretation of
 what species are included in the claim).
 


Undue breadth of the claim may be addressed under different statutory
 provisions, depending on the reasons for concluding that the claim is too broad. If the
 claim is too broad because it does not set forth that which the inventor or a joint
 inventor regards as the invention as evidenced by statements outside of the application
 as filed, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, would be appropriate. If the claim is too
 broad because it is not supported by the original description or by an enabling
 disclosure, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, would be appropriate. If the claim is too
 broad because it reads on the prior art, a rejection under either **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** would be appropriate.

The following sections are devoted to a discussion of specific topics
 where issues under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or

 paragraph, but are intended to provide guidance in areas that have been addressed with
 some frequency in recent examination practice. The court and Board decisions cited are
 representative. As with all appellate decisions, the results are largely dictated by the
 facts in each case. The use of the same language in a different context may justify a
 different result.

# 2173.05(a) New Terminology [R-07.2015]

**I.** **THE MEANING OF EVERY TERM SHOULD BE APPARENT**The meaning of every term used in a claim should be apparent from
 the prior art or from the specification and drawings at the time the application
 is filed. Claim language may not be "ambiguous, vague, incoherent, opaque, or
 otherwise unclear in describing and defining the claimed invention."
 *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1311. Applicants need not confine
 themselves to the terminology used in the prior art, but are required to make
 clear and precise the terms that are used to define the invention whereby the
 metes and bounds of the claimed invention can be ascertained. During patent
 examination, the pending claims must be given the broadest reasonable
 interpretation consistent with the specification. *In re Morris,*
 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *In re
 Prater,* 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (CCPA 1969). See also
 **[MPEP §
 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** - **[§ 2111.01](s2111.html#d0e200409)**. When the specification
 states the meaning that a term in the claim is intended to have, the claim is
 examined using that meaning, in order to achieve a complete exploration of the
 applicant’s invention and its relation to the prior art. *In re
 Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 13 USPQ2d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 

**II.** **THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AND PRECISION MUST BE BALANCED WITH THE
 LIMITATIONS OF THE LANGUAGE**Courts have recognized that it is not only permissible, but often
 desirable, to use new terms that are frequently more precise in describing and
 defining the new invention. *In re**Fisher,* 427 F.2d 833, 166 USPQ 18 (CCPA 1970). Although it is
 difficult to compare the claimed invention with the prior art when new terms are
 used that do not appear in the prior art, this does not make the new terms
 indefinite. 
 


New terms are often used when a new technology is in its infancy
 or is rapidly evolving. The requirements for clarity and precision must be
 balanced with the limitations of the language and the science. If the claims, read
 in light of the specification, reasonably apprise those skilled in the art both of
 the utilization and scope of the invention, and if the language is as precise as
 the subject matter permits, the statute (**[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph) demands no more. *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1313 ("[H]ow
 much clarity is required necessarily invokes some standard of reasonable precision
 in the use of language in the context of the circumstances."). This does not mean
 that the examiner must accept the best effort of applicant. If the language is not
 considered as precise as the subject matter permits, the examiner should provide
 reasons to support the conclusion of indefiniteness and is encouraged to suggest
 alternatives that would not be subject to rejection.
 

**III.** **TERMS USED CONTRARY TO THEIR ORDINARY MEANING MUST BE CLEARLY REDEFINED IN
 THE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION**Consistent with the well-established axiom in patent law that a
 patentee or applicant is free to be his or her own lexicographer, a patentee or
 applicant may use terms in a manner contrary to or inconsistent with one or more
 of their ordinary meanings if the written description clearly redefines the terms.
 See, e.g., *Process Control Corp. v. HydReclaim Corp.,* 190 F.3d
 1350, 1357, 52 USPQ2d 1029, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("While we have held many times
 that a patentee can act as his own lexicographer to specifically define terms of a
 claim contrary to their ordinary meaning," in such a situation the written
 description must clearly redefine a claim term "so as to put a reasonable
 competitor or one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the patentee
 intended to so redefine that claim term."); *Hormone Research Foundation
 Inc.**v.**Genentech Inc.,* 904 F.2d 1558, 15 USPQ2d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
 Accordingly, when there is more than one meaning for a term, it is incumbent upon
 applicant to make clear which meaning is being relied upon to claim the invention.
 Until the meaning of a term or phrase used in a claim is clear, a rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is appropriate. It is appropriate to compare the meaning of terms given
 in technical dictionaries in order to ascertain the accepted meaning of a term in
 the art. *In re Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971).

 § 2111.01](s2111.html#d0e200409)**.
 




# 2173.05(b) Relative Terminology [R-08.2017]


The use of relative terminology in claim language, including terms
 of degree, does not automatically render the claim indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. *Seattle Box Co., Inc. v. Industrial Crating & Packing,
 Inc.,* 731 F.2d 818, 221 USPQ 568 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Acceptability of the
 claim language depends on whether one of ordinary skill in the art would understand
 what is claimed, in light of the specification.
 

**I.** **TERMS OF DEGREE**Terms of degree are not necessarily indefinite.
 "Claim language employing terms of degree has long been found definite where it
 provided enough certainty to one of skill in the art when read in the context of
 the invention." *Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,* 766 F.3d
 1364, 1370, 112 USPQ2d 1188, 1192-93 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (citing *Eibel
 Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co.,* 261 U.S. 45, 65-66
 (1923) (finding ‘substantial pitch’ sufficiently definite because one skilled in
 the art ‘had no difficulty … in determining what was the substantial pitch needed’
 to practice the invention)). Thus, when a term of degree is used in the claim, the
 examiner should determine whether the specification provides some standard for
 measuring that degree. *Hearing Components, Inc. v. Shure Inc.,*
 600 F.3d 1357, 1367, 94 USPQ2d 1385, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *Enzo Biochem,
 Inc., v. Applera Corp.,* 599 F.3d 1325, 1332, 94 USPQ2d 1321, 1326
 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *Seattle Box Co., Inc. v. Indus. Crating & Packing,
 Inc.,* 731 F.2d 818, 826, 221 USPQ 568, 574 (Fed. Cir. 1984). If the
 specification does not provide some standard for measuring that degree, a
 determination must be made as to whether one of ordinary skill in the art could
 nevertheless ascertain the scope of the claim (e.g., a standard that is recognized
 in the art for measuring the meaning of the term of degree). For example, in
 *Ex parte Oetiker,* 23 USPQ2d 1641 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992), the phrases "relatively shallow," "of the order of," "the order of about
 5mm," and "substantial portion" were held to be indefinite because the
 specification lacked some standard for measuring the degrees intended.
 


The claim is not indefinite if the specification
 provides examples or teachings that can be used to measure a degree even without a
 precise numerical measurement (e.g., a figure that provides a standard for
 measuring the meaning of the term of degree). See, e.g., *Interval
 Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,* 766 F.3d 1364, 1371-72, 112 USPQ2d 1188,
 1193 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (observing that although there is no absolute or
 mathematical precision required, "[t]he claims, when read in light of the
 specification and the prosecution history, must provide objective boundaries for
 those of skill in the art"). 
 


During prosecution, an applicant may also overcome
 an indefiniteness rejection by providing evidence that the meaning of the term of
 degree can be ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art when reading the
 disclosure. For example, in *Enzo Biochem,* the applicant
 submitted a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** showing examples
 that met the claim limitation and examples that did not. *Enzo
 Biochem,* 599 F.3d at 1335, 94 USPQ2d at 1328 (noting that applicant
 overcame an indefiniteness rejection over "not interfering substantially" claim
 language by submitting a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** listing eight
 specific linkage groups that applicant declared did not substantially interfere
 with hybridization or detection). 
 


 Even if the specification uses the same term of
 degree as in the claim, a rejection is proper if the scope of the term is not
 understood when read in light of the specification. While, as a general
 proposition, broadening modifiers are standard tools in claim drafting in order to
 avoid reliance on the doctrine of equivalents in infringement actions, when the
 scope of the claim is unclear a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is proper. See *In re Wiggins,* 488 F. 2d 538, 541,
 179 USPQ 421, 423 (CCPA 1973).
 


When relative terms are used in claims wherein the improvement
 over the prior art rests entirely upon size or weight of an element in a
 combination of elements, the adequacy of the disclosure of a standard is of
 greater criticality.
 

**II.** **REFERENCE TO AN OBJECT THAT IS VARIABLE MAY RENDER A CLAIM
 INDEFINITE**A claim may be rendered indefinite by reference to an object that
 is variable. See, e.g., *Ex parte Miyazaki,* 89 USPQ2d 1207 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 2008) (precedential) and *Ex parte
 Brummer,* 12 USPQ2d 1653 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). In
 *Miyazaki,* the Board held that claims to a large printer were
 not sufficiently definite because:
 



> 
> The language of claim 1 attempts to claim the
>  height of the paper feeding unit in relation to a user of a specific height who
>  is performing operations on the printer.... Claim 1 fails to specify, however,
>  a positional relationship of the user and the printer to each other. 
>  
> 
> 
> 


*Miyazaki,* 89 USPQ2d at 1212. In *Brummer,* the
 Board held that a limitation in a claim to a bicycle that recited "said front and
 rear wheels so spaced as to give a wheelbase that is between 58 percent and 75
 percent of the height of the rider that the bicycle was designed for" was
 indefinite because the relationship of parts was not based on any known standard
 for sizing a bicycle to a rider, but on a rider of unspecified build.
 *Brummer,* 12 USPQ2d at 1655.
 


On the other hand, a claim limitation specifying
 that a certain part of a pediatric wheelchair be "so dimensioned as to be
 insertable through the space between the doorframe of an automobile and one of the
 seats" was held to be definite. *Orthokinetics, Inc.**v.**Safety Travel Chairs, Inc.,* 806 F.2d 1565, 1 USPQ2d 1081 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986). The court stated that the phrase "so dimensioned" is as accurate as
 the subject matter permits, noting that the patent law does not require that all
 possible lengths corresponding to the spaces in hundreds of different automobiles
 be listed in the patent, let alone that they be listed in the claims.
 

**III.** **APPROXIMATIONS*** 

***A.******"About"***In determining the range encompassed by the term
 
 "about"
 
 
 , one must
 consider the context of the term as it is used in the specification and claims
 of the application. *Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v. Caraco Pharm. Labs.,
 Ltd.,* 476 F.3d 1321, 1326, 81 USPQ2d 1427, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
 In*W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc.**v.**Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 220 USPQ 303 (Fed. Cir. 1983),
 the court held that a limitation defining the stretch rate of a plastic as
 "exceeding about 10% per second" is definite because infringement could clearly
 be assessed through the use of a stopwatch. However, in another case, the court
 held that claims reciting "at least about" were invalid for indefiniteness
 where there was close prior art and there was nothing in the specification,
 prosecution history, or the prior art to provide any indication as to what
 range of specific activity is covered by the term "about." *Amgen, Inc.* *v.**Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 18 USPQ2d 1016
 (Fed. Cir. 1991).
 

***B.******"Essentially"***The phrase "a silicon dioxide source that is essentially free
 of alkali metal" was held to be definite because the specification contained
 guidelines and examples that were considered sufficient to enable a person of
 ordinary skill in the art to draw a line between unavoidable impurities in
 starting materials and essential ingredients. *In re**Marosi,* 710 F.2d 799, 218 USPQ 289 (CCPA 1983). The court
 further observed that it would be impractical to require applicants to specify
 a particular number as a cutoff between their invention and the prior art.
 

***C.******"Similar"***The term "similar" in the preamble of a claim that was
 directed to a nozzle "for high-pressure cleaning units or similar apparatus"
 was held to be indefinite since it was not clear what applicant intended to
 cover by the recitation "similar" apparatus. *Ex parte**Kristensen,* 10 USPQ2d 1701 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1989).
 


A claim in a design patent application which read: "The
 ornamental design for a feed bunk or similar structure as shown and described."
 was held to be indefinite because it was unclear from the specification what
 applicant intended to cover by the recitation of "similar structure."
 *Ex parte**Pappas,* 23 USPQ2d 1636 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992).
 

***D.******"Substantially"***The term "substantially" is often used in conjunction with
 another term to describe a particular characteristic of the claimed invention.
 It is a broad term. *In re**Nehrenberg,* 280 F.2d 161, 126 USPQ 383 (CCPA 1960). The
 court held that the limitation "to substantially increase the efficiency of the
 compound as a copper extractant" was definite in view of the general guidelines
 contained in the specification. *In re**Mattison,* 509 F.2d 563, 184 USPQ 484 (CCPA 1975). The court
 held that the limitation "which produces substantially equal E and H plane
 illumination patterns" was definite because one of ordinary skill in the art
 would know what was meant by "substantially equal." *Andrew
 Corp.**v.**Gabriel Electronics,* 847 F.2d 819, 6 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir.
 1988).
 

***E.******"Type"***The addition of the word "type" to an otherwise definite
 expression (e.g., Friedel-Crafts catalyst) extends the scope of the expression
 so as to render it indefinite.  *Ex parte**Copenhaver,* 109 USPQ 118 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1955).
 Likewise, the phrase "ZSM-5-type aluminosilicate zeolites" was held to be
 indefinite because it was unclear what "type" was intended to convey. The
 interpretation was made more difficult by the fact that the zeolites defined in
 the dependent claims were not within the genus of the type of zeolites defined
 in the independent claim. *Ex parte**Attig,* 7 USPQ2d 1092 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986).
 

**IV.** **SUBJECTIVE TERMS**When a subjective term is used in the claim, the
 examiner should determine whether the specification supplies some standard for
 measuring the scope of the term, similar to the analysis for a term of degree.
 Some objective standard must be provided in order to allow the public to determine
 the scope of the claim. A claim that requires the exercise of subjective judgment
 without restriction may render the claim indefinite. *In re
 Musgrave,* 431 F.2d 882, 893, 167 USPQ 280, 289 (CCPA 1970). Claim
 scope cannot depend solely on the unrestrained, subjective opinion of a particular
 individual purported to be practicing the invention. *Datamize LLC v.
 Plumtree Software, Inc.,* 417 F.3d 1342, 1350, 75 USPQ2d 1801, 1807
 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); see also *Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL,
 Inc.,* 766 F.3d 1364, 1373, 112 USPQ2d 1188 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding
 the claim phrase "unobtrusive manner" indefinite because the specification did not
 "provide a reasonably clear and exclusive definition, leaving the facially
 subjective claim language without an objective boundary"). 
 


For example, in *Datamize,* the
 invention was directed to a computer interface screen with an "aesthetically
 pleasing look and feel." *Datamize,* 417 F.3d at 1344-45. The
 meaning of the term "aesthetically pleasing" depended solely on the subjective
 opinion of the person selecting features to be included on the interface screen.
 Nothing in the intrinsic evidence (e.g., the specification) provided any guidance
 as to what design choices would result in an "aesthetically pleasing" look and
 feel. *Id.* at 1352. The claims were held indefinite because the
 interface screen may be "aesthetically pleasing" to one user but not to another.
 *Id.* at 1350. See also *Ex parte Anderson,*
 21 USPQ2d 1241 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991) (the terms "comparable" and
 "superior" were held to be indefinite in the context of a limitation relating the
 characteristics of the claimed material to other materials). 
 


During prosecution, the applicant may overcome a
 rejection by amending the claim to remove the subjective term, or by providing
 evidence that the meaning of the term can be ascertained by one of ordinary skill
 in the art when reading the disclosure. However, "[f]or some facially subjective
 terms, the definiteness requirement is not satisfied by merely offering examples
 that satisfy the term within the specification." *DDR Holdings, LLC v.
 Hotels.com, L.P.,* 773 F.3d 1245, 1261, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1108 (Fed.
 Cir. 2014).
 




# 2173.05(c) Numerical Ranges and Amounts Limitations [R-11.2013]


Generally, the recitation of specific numerical ranges in a claim
 does not raise an issue of whether a claim is definite.
 

**I.** **NARROW AND BROADER RANGES IN THE SAME CLAIM**Use of a narrow numerical range that falls within a broader range
 in the same claim may render the claim indefinite when the boundaries of the claim
 are not discernible. Description of examples and preferences is properly set forth
 in the specification rather than in a single claim. A narrower range or preferred
 embodiment may also be set forth in another independent claim or in a dependent
 claim. If stated in a single claim, examples and preferences lead to confusion
 over the intended scope of the claim. In those instances where it is not clear
 whether the claimed narrower range is a limitation, a rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph should be made. The Examiner should analyze whether the metes and bounds
 of the claim are clearly set forth. Examples of claim language which have been
 held to be indefinite are (A) "a temperature of between 45 and 78 degrees Celsius,
 preferably between 50 and 60 degrees Celsius"; and (B) "a predetermined quantity,
 for example, the maximum capacity."
 


While a single claim that includes both a broad and a narrower
 range may be indefinite, it is not improper under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, to present a dependent claim that sets forth a narrower range for an
 element than the range set forth in the claim from which it depends. For example,
 if claim 1 reads "A circuit … wherein the resistance is 70-150 ohms." and claim 2
 reads "The circuit of claim 1 wherein the resistance is 70-100 ohms.", then claim
 2 should not be rejected as indefinite. 
 

**II.** **OPEN-ENDED NUMERICAL RANGES**Open-ended numerical ranges should be carefully analyzed for
 definiteness. For example, when an independent claim recites a composition
 comprising "at least 20% sodium" and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts
 of nonsodium ingredients which add up to 100%, apparently to the exclusion of
 sodium, an ambiguity is created with regard to the "at least" limitation (unless
 the percentages of the nonsodium ingredients are based on the weight of the
 nonsodium ingredients). On the other hand, the court held that a composition
 claimed to have a theoretical content greater than 100% (i.e., 20-80% of A, 20-80%
 of B  and 1-25% of C) was not indefinite simply because the claims may be read in
 theory to include compositions that are impossible in fact to formulate. It was
 observed that subject matter which cannot exist in fact can neither anticipate nor
 infringe a claim. *In re**Kroekel,* 504 F.2d 1143, 183 USPQ 610 (CCPA 1974).
 


In a claim directed to a chemical reaction process, a limitation
 required that the amount of one ingredient in the reaction mixture should "be
 maintained at less than 7 mole percent" based on the amount of another ingredient.
 The examiner argued that the claim was indefinite because the limitation sets only
 a maximum amount and is inclusive of substantially no ingredient resulting in
 termination of any reaction. The court did not agree, holding that the claim was
 clearly directed to a reaction process, and explaining that "[t]he imposition of a
 maximum limit on the quantity of one of the reactants without specifying a minimum
 does not warrant distorting the overall meaning of the claim to preclude
 performing the claimed process."*In re**Kirsch,* 498 F.2d 1389, 1394, 182 USPQ 286, 290 (CCPA 1974).
 


Some terms have been determined to have the following meanings in
 the factual situations of the reported cases: the term "up to" includes zero as a
 lower limit, *In re**Mochel,* 470 F.2d 638, 176 USPQ 194 (CCPA 1974); and "a moisture
 content of not more than 70% by weight" reads on dry material, *Ex
 parte**Khusid,* 174 USPQ 59 (Bd. App. 1971).
 

**III.** **"EFFECTIVE AMOUNT"**The common phrase "an effective amount" may or may not be
 indefinite. The proper test is whether or not one skilled in the art could
 determine specific values for the amount based on the disclosure. See *In
 re**Mattison,* 509 F.2d 563, 184 USPQ 484 (CCPA 1975). The phrase
 "an effective amount . . . for growth stimulation" was held to be definite where
 the amount was not critical and those skilled in the art would be able to
 determine from the written disclosure, including the examples, what an effective
 amount is. *In re**Halleck,* 422 F.2d 911, 164 USPQ 647 (CCPA 1970). The phrase "an
 effective amount" has been held to be indefinite when the claim fails to state the
 function which is to be achieved and more than one effect can be implied from the
 specification or the relevant art. *In re**Fredericksen,* 213 F.2d 547, 102 USPQ 35 (CCPA 1954). The more
 recent cases have tended to accept a limitation such as "an effective amount" as
 being definite when read in light of the supporting disclosure and in the absence
 of any prior art which would give rise to uncertainty about the scope of the
 claim. In *Ex parte**Skuballa,* 12 USPQ2d 1570 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989), the
 Board held that a pharmaceutical composition claim which recited an "effective
 amount of a compound of claim 1" without stating the function to be achieved was
 definite, particularly when read in light of the supporting disclosure which
 provided guidelines as to the intended utilities and how the uses could be
 effected.
 




# 2173.05(d) Exemplary Claim Language ("for example," "such
 as") [R-07.2015]


Description of examples or preferences is properly set forth in the
 specification rather than the claims. If stated in the claims, examples and
 preferences may lead to confusion over the intended scope of a claim. In those
 instances where it is not clear whether the claimed narrower range is a limitation, a
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph should be made. The examiner
 should analyze whether the metes and bounds of the claim are clearly set forth. Note
 that the mere use of the phrase "such as" or "for example" in a claim does not by
 itself render the claim indefinite.
 


 Examples of claim language which have been held to be
 indefinite because the intended scope of the claim was unclear are: 
 


* (A) "R is halogen, for example, chlorine";
* (B) "material such as rock wool or asbestos" *Ex
 parte**Hall,* 83 USPQ 38 (Bd. App. 1949);
* (C) "lighter hydrocarbons, such, for example, as the vapors or gas
 produced" *Ex parte**Hasche,* 86 USPQ 481 (Bd. App. 1949);
* (D) "normal operating conditions such as while in the container of
 a proportioner" *Ex parte**Steigerwald,* 131 USPQ 74 (Bd. App. 1961); and
* (E) "coke, brick, or like material". *Ex
 parte Caldwell,* 1906 C.D. 58 (Comm’r Pat. 1906).


The above examples of claim language which have been held to be
 indefinite are fact specific and should not be applied as
 *per se* rules. See **[MPEP § 2173.02](s2173.html#d0e217598)** for guidance
 regarding when it is appropriate to make a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 




# 2173.05(e) Lack of Antecedent Basis [R-08.2017]


A claim is indefinite when it contains words or phrases whose
 meaning is unclear. *In re Packard,* 751 F.3d 1307, 1314, 110 USPQ2d
 1785, 1789 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The lack of clarity could arise where a claim refers to
 "said lever" or "the lever," where the claim contains no earlier recitation or
 limitation of a lever and where it would be unclear as to what element the limitation
 was making reference. Similarly, if two different levers are recited earlier in the
 claim, the recitation of "said lever" in the same or subsequent claim would be
 unclear where it is uncertain which of the two levers was intended. A claim which
 refers to "said aluminum lever," but recites only "a lever" earlier in the claim, is
 indefinite because it is uncertain as to the lever to which reference is made.
 Obviously, however, the failure to provide explicit antecedent basis for terms does
 not always render a claim indefinite. If the scope of a claim would be reasonably
 ascertainable by those skilled in the art, then the claim is not indefinite.
 *Ex parte Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144, 1145 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1992) ("controlled stream of fluid" provided reasonable antecedent basis for
 "the controlled fluid"). Inherent components of elements recited have antecedent
 basis in the recitation of the components themselves. For example, the limitation
 "the outer surface of said sphere" would not require an antecedent recitation that
 the sphere has an outer surface. See *Bose Corp. v. JBL, Inc.,* 274
 F.3d 1354, 1359, 61 USPQ2d 1216, 1218-19 (Fed. Cir 2001) (holding that recitation of
 "an ellipse" provided antecedent basis for "an ellipse having a major diameter"
 because "[t]here can be no dispute that mathematically an inherent characteristic of
 an ellipse is a major diameter").
 

**I.** **EXAMINER SHOULD SUGGEST CORRECTIONS TO ANTECEDENT PROBLEMS**Antecedent problems in the claims are typically drafting
 oversights that are easily corrected once they are brought to the attention of
 applicant. The examiner’s task of making sure the claim language complies with the
 requirements of the statute should be carried out in a positive and constructive
 way, so that minor problems can be identified and easily corrected, and so that
 the major effort is expended on more substantive issues. However, even though
 indefiniteness in claim language is of semantic origin, it is not rendered
 unobjectionable simply because it could have been corrected. *In re
 Hammack,* 427 F.2d 1384, 1388 n.5, 166 USPQ 209, 213 n.5 (CCPA
 1970).
 

**II.** **A CLAIM TERM WHICH HAS NO ANTECEDENT BASIS IN THE DISCLOSURE IS NOT
 NECESSARILY INDEFINITE**The mere fact that a term or phrase used in the claim has no
 antecedent basis in the specification disclosure does not mean, necessarily, that
 the term or phrase is indefinite. There is no requirement that the words in the
 claim must match those used in the specification disclosure. Applicants are given
 a great deal of latitude in how they choose to define their invention so long as
 the terms and phrases used define the invention with a reasonable degree of
 clarity and precision. 
 

**III.** **A CLAIM IS NOT *PER SE* INDEFINITE IF THE BODY OF THE
 CLAIM RECITES ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR IN THE PREAMBLE**The mere fact that the body of a claim recites additional
 elements which do not appear in the claim’s preamble does not render the claim
 indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. See *In re
 Larsen,* 10 Fed. App'x 890 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (The preamble of the
 *Larsen* claim recited only a hanger and a loop but the body
 of the claim positively recited a linear member. The examiner rejected the claim
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, because the omission from the claim’s
 preamble of a critical element (i.e., a linear member) renders that claim
 indefinite. The court reversed the examiner’s rejection and stated that the
 totality of all the limitations of the claim and their interaction with each other
 must be considered to ascertain the inventor’s contribution to the art. Upon
 review of the claim in its entirety, the court concluded that the claim at issue
 apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves the
 notice function required by **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, paragraph 2.).
 
 




# 2173.05(f) Reference to Limitations in Another Claim [R-11.2013]


A claim which makes reference to a preceding claim to define a
 limitation is an acceptable claim construction which should not necessarily be
 rejected as improper or confusing under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. For example, claims which read:
 "The product produced by the method of claim 1." or "A method of producing ethanol
 comprising contacting amylose with the culture of claim 1 under the following
 conditions ....." are not indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, merely because of the reference to another claim. See also *Ex
 parte**Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (where
 reference to "the nozzle of claim 7" in a method claim was held to comply with
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph). However, where the format of making
 reference to limitations recited in another claim results in confusion, then a
 rejection would be proper under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. 
 


When examining a dependent claim, the examiner should
 also determine whether the claim complies with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, fourth
 paragraph. See **[MPEP §
 608.01(n)](s608.html#d0e45256)**, subsection II.
 




# 2173.05(g) Functional Limitations [R-08.2017]


A claim term is functional when it recites a feature "by what it
 does rather than by what it is" (e.g., as evidenced by its specific structure or
 specific ingredients). *In re**Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 212, 169 USPQ 226, 229 (CCPA 1971). There
 is nothing inherently wrong with defining some part of an invention in functional
 terms. Functional language does not, in and of itself, render a claim improper.
 *Id.* In fact, **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, expressly authorize a form of
 functional claiming (means- (or step-) plus- function claim limitations discussed in
 **[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)***et seq.*). Functional language may also be employed to limit the
 claims without using the means-plus-function format. See, e.g., *K-2 Corp. v.
 Salomon S.A.,* 191 F.3d 1356, 1363, 52 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir.
 1999). Unlike means-plus-function claim language that applies only to purely
 functional limitations, *Phillips v. AWH Corp.,* 415 F.3d 1303,
 1311, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2005) *(en banc)*
 ("Means-plus-function claiming applies only to purely functional limitations that do
 not provide the structure that performs the recited function."), functional claiming
 often involves the recitation of some structure followed by its function. For
 example, in *In re Schreiber,* the claims were directed to a conical
 spout (the structure) that "allow[ed] several kernels of popped popcorn to pass
 through at the same time" (the function). *In re Schreiber,* 128
 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997). As noted by the court in
 *Schreiber,* "[a] patent applicant is free to recite features of
 an apparatus either structurally or functionally." *Id.*


A functional limitation must be evaluated and considered, just like
 any other limitation of the claim, for what it fairly conveys to a person of ordinary
 skill in the pertinent art in the context in which it is used. A functional
 limitation is often used in association with an element, ingredient, or step of a
 process to define a particular capability or purpose that is served by the recited
 element, ingredient or step. In *Innova/Pure Water Inc. v. Safari Water
 Filtration Sys. Inc.,* 381 F.3d 1111, 1117-20, 72 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-08
 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court noted that the claim term "operatively connected" is "a
 general descriptive claim term frequently used in patent drafting to reflect a
 functional relationship between claimed components," that is, the term "means the
 claimed components must be connected in a way to perform a designated function." "In
 the absence of modifiers, general descriptive terms are typically construed as having
 their full meaning." *Id.* at 1118, 72 USPQ2d at 1006. In the patent
 claim at issue, "subject to any clear and unmistakable disavowal of claim scope, the
 term ‘operatively connected’ takes the full breath of its ordinary meaning, i.e.,
 ‘said tube [is] operatively connected to said cap’ when the tube and cap are arranged
 in a manner capable of performing the function of filtering." *Id.*
 at 1120, 72 USPQ2d at 1008.
 


Other examples of permissible function language include the
 following. 
 



It was held that the limitation used to define a
 radical on a chemical compound as "incapable of forming a dye with said oxidizing
 developing agent" although functional, was perfectly acceptable because it set
 definite boundaries on the patent protection sought. *In re
 Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971). 
 




In a claim that was directed to a kit of component
 parts capable of being assembled, the court held that limitations such as "members
 adapted to be positioned" and "portions . . . being resiliently dilatable whereby
 said housing may be slidably positioned" serve to precisely define present
 structural attributes of interrelated component parts of the claimed assembly.
 *In re Venezia,* 530 F.2d 956, 189 USPQ 149 (CCPA 1976).
 



Notwithstanding the permissible instances, the use of
 functional language in a claim may fail "to provide a clear-cut indication of the
 scope of the subject matter embraced by the claim" and thus be indefinite.
 *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 213 (CCPA 1971). For example,
 when claims merely recite a description of a problem to be solved or a function or
 result achieved by the invention, the boundaries of the claim scope may be unclear.
 *Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v. M-I LLC,* 514 F.3d 1244,
 1255, 85 USPQ2d 1654, 1663 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that the Supreme Court explained
 that a vice of functional claiming occurs "when the inventor is painstaking when he
 recites what has already been seen, and then uses conveniently functional language at
 the exact point of novelty") (quoting *General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance
 Corp.,* 304 U.S. 364, 371 (1938)); see also *United Carbon Co. v.
 Binney & Smith Co.,* 317 U.S. 228, 234 (1942) (holding indefinite
 claims that recited substantially pure carbon black "in the form of commercially
 uniform, comparatively small, rounded smooth aggregates having a spongy or porous
 exterior"). Further, without reciting the particular structure, materials or steps
 that accomplish the function or achieve the result, all means or methods of resolving
 the problem may be encompassed by the claim. *Ariad Pharmaceuticals., Inc. v.
 Eli Lilly & Co.,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1353, 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1173 (Fed.
 Cir. 2010) *(en banc)*. See also *Datamize LLC v. Plumtree
 Software Inc.,* 75 USPQ2d 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2005) where a claim directed to
 a software based system for creating a customized computer interface screen recited
 that the screen be "aesthetically pleasing," which is an intended result and does not
 provide a clear cut indication of scope because it imposed no structural limits on
 the screen. Unlimited functional claim limitations that extend to all means or
 methods of resolving a problem may not be adequately supported by the written
 description or may not be commensurate in scope with the enabling disclosure, both of
 which are required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. *In re Hyatt,*
 708 F.2d 712, 714, 218 USPQ 195, 197 (Fed. Cir. 1983); *Ariad,* 598
 F.3d at 1340, 94 USPQ2d at 1167. For instance, a single means claim covering every
 conceivable means for achieving the stated result was held to be invalid under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph because the court recognized that the
 specification, which disclosed only those means known to the inventor, was not
 commensurate in scope with the claim. *Hyatt,* 708 F.2d at 714-715,
 218 USPQ at 197. For more information regarding the written description requirement
 and enablement requirement under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, see **[MPEP §§
 2161](s2161.html#d0e213359)**-**[2164.08(c)](s2164.html#d0e216899)**. Examiners should keep in
 mind that whether or not the functional limitation complies with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is a different issue from whether the limitation is properly supported
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, or is distinguished over the prior art. 
 


When a claim limitation employs functional language,
 the examiner’s determination of whether the limitation is sufficiently definite will
 be highly dependent on context (e.g., the disclosure in the specification and the
 knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art). *Halliburton Energy
 Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255, 85 USPQ2d at 1663. For example, a claim that
 included the term "fragile gel" was found to be indefinite because the definition of
 the term in the specification was functional, i.e., the fluid is defined by what it
 does rather than what it is ("ability of the fluid to transition quickly from gel to
 liquid, and the ability of the fluid to suspend drill cuttings at rest"), and it was
 ambiguous as to the requisite degree of the fragileness of the gel, the ability of
 the gel to suspend drill cuttings (i.e., gel strength), and/or some combination of
 the two. *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255-56, 85 USPQ2d
 at 1663. In another example, the claims directed to a tungsten filament for electric
 incandescent lamps were held invalid for including a limitation that recited
 "comparatively large grains of such size and contour as to prevent substantial
 sagging or offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for such a lamp or
 other device." *General Elec. Co.,* 304 U.S. at 370-71, 375. The
 Court observed that the prior art filaments also "consisted of comparatively large
 crystals" but they were "subject to offsetting" or shifting, and the Court further
 found that the phrase "of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and
 offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for a lamp or other device"
 did not adequately define the structural characteristics of the grains (e.g., the
 size and contour) to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art.
 *Id.* at 370. Similarly, a claim was held invalid because it
 recited "sustantially (sic) pure carbon black in the form of commercially uniform,
 comparatively small, rounded smooth aggregates having a spongy or porous exterior."
 *United Carbon Co.,* 317 U.S. at 234. In the latter example, the
 Court observed various problems with the limitation: "commercially uniform" meant
 only the degree of uniformity buyers desired; "comparatively small" did not add
 anything because no standard for comparison was given; and "spongy" and "porous" are
 synonyms that the Court found unhelpful in distinguishing the claimed invention from
 the prior art. *Id.* at 233. 
 


In comparison, a claim limitation reciting
 "transparent to infrared rays" was held to be definite because the specification
 showed that a substantial amount of infrared radiation was always transmitted even
 though the degree of transparency varied depending on certain factors.
 *Swinehart,* 439 F.2d at 214, 169 USPQ at 230. Likewise, the
 claims in another case were held definite because applicant provided "a general
 guideline and examples sufficient to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to
 determine whether a process uses a silicon dioxide source ‘essentially free of alkali
 metal’ to make a reaction mixture ‘essentially free of alkali metal’ to produce a
 zeolitic compound ‘essentially free of alkali metal.’" *In re
 Marosi,* 710 F.2d 799, 803, 218 USPQ 289, 293 (Fed. Cir. 1983). 
 


Examiners should consider the following factors when
 examining claims that contain functional language to determine whether the language
 is ambiguous: (1) whether there is a clear cut indication of the scope of the subject
 matter covered by the claim; (2) whether the language sets forth well-defined
 boundaries of the invention or only states a problem solved or a result obtained; and
 (3) whether one of ordinary skill in the art would know from the claim terms what
 structure or steps are encompassed by the claim. These factors are examples of points
 to be considered when determining whether language is ambiguous and are not intended
 to be all inclusive or limiting. Other factors may be more relevant for particular
 arts. The primary inquiry is whether the language leaves room for ambiguity or
 whether the boundaries are clear and precise. 
 


During prosecution, applicant may resolve the
 ambiguities of a functional limitation in a number of ways. For example: (1) "the
 ambiguity might be resolved by using a quantitative metric (e.g., numeric limitation
 as to a physical property) rather than a qualitative functional feature" (see
 *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255-56, 85 USPQ2d at
 1663); (2) applicant could demonstrate that the "specification provide[s] a formula
 for calculating a property along with examples that meet the claim limitation and
 examples that do not" (see *id.* at 1256, 85 USPQ2d at 1663 (citing
 *Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int’l,* 316 F.3d 1331, 1341, 65
 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003))); (3) applicant could demonstrate that the
 specification provides a general guideline and examples sufficient to teach a person
 skilled in the art when the claim limitation was satisfied (see
 *Marosi,* 710 F.2d at 803, 218 USPQ at 292); or (4) applicant
 could amend the claims to recite the particular structure that accomplishes the
 function. 
 




# 2173.05(h) Alternative Limitations [R-10.2019]

**I.** **MARKUSH GROUPS**A claim which recites a list of alternatives to
 define a limitation is an acceptable claim construction which should not
 necessarily be rejected as confusing under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or as improper. See **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)** for guidelines regarding the determination of
 whether a Markush grouping is improper.
 


Treatment of claims reciting alternatives is not governed by the
 particular format used (e.g., alternatives may be set forth as "a material
 selected from the group consisting of A, B, and C" or "wherein the material is A,
 B, or C"). See, e.g., the *Supplementary Examination Guidelines for
 Determining Compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112 and for Treatment of Related Issues
 in Patent Applications* ("Supplementary Guidelines"), 76 Fed. Reg.
 7162, 7166 (February 9, 2011). Claims that set forth a list of alternatives from
 which a selection is to be made are typically referred to as Markush claims, after
 the appellant in *Ex parte Markush,* 1925 Dec. Comm’r Pat. 126,
 127 (1924). The listing of specified alternatives within a Markush claim is
 referred to as a Markush group or Markush grouping. *Abbott Labs v. Baxter
 Pharmaceutical Products, Inc.,* 334 F.3d 1274, 1280-81, 67 USPQ2d
 1191, 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing to several sources that describe Markush
 groups).
 


See **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)** for a general discussion of Markush claims and
 guidelines regarding the determination of whether a Markush grouping is improper,
 and **[MPEP §
 803.02](s803.html#d0e98237)** for a discussion of election requirements in
 Markush claims.
 


A Markush grouping is a closed group of
 alternatives, i.e., the selection is made from a group "consisting of" (rather
 than "comprising" or "including") the alternative members. *Abbott
 Labs.,* 334 F.3d at 1280, 67 USPQ2d at 1196. If a Markush grouping
 requires a material selected from an open list of alternatives (e.g., selected
 from the group "comprising" or "consisting essentially of" the recited
 alternatives), the claim should generally be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** as indefinite because it is unclear what other
 alternatives are intended to be encompassed by the claim. If a claim is intended
 to encompass combinations or mixtures of the alternatives set forth in the Markush
 grouping, the claim may include qualifying language preceding the recited
 alternatives (such as "at least one member" selected from the group), or within
 the list of alternatives (such as "or mixtures thereof"). *Id.*
 at 1281. See also **[MPEP § 2111.03](s2111.html#d0e200824)**. 
 


A Markush grouping may include a large number of
 alternatives, and as a result a Markush claim may encompass a large number of
 alternative members or embodiments, but a claim is not necessarily indefinite
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** for such breadth. *In re
 Gardner,* 427 F.2d 786, 788, 166 USPQ 138, 140 (CCPA 1970) ("Breadth
 is not indefiniteness."). In certain circumstances, however, a Markush group may
 be so expansive that persons skilled in the art cannot determine the metes and
 bounds of the claimed invention. For example, if a claim defines a chemical
 compound using one or more Markush groups, and that claim encompasses a massive
 number of distinct alternative members, the claim may be indefinite under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** if one skilled in the art cannot determine its
 metes and bounds due to an inability to envision all of the compounds defined by
 the Markush group(s). In such a circumstance, a rejection of the claim for
 indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** is
 appropriate.
 


The use of Markush claims of diminishing scope should not, in
 itself, be considered a sufficient basis for objection to or rejection of claims.
 However, if such a practice renders the claims indefinite or if it results in
 undue multiplicity, an appropriate rejection should be made. 
 


Similarly, the double inclusion of an element by members of a
 Markush group is not, in itself, sufficient basis for objection to or rejection of
 claims. Rather, the facts in each case must be evaluated to determine whether or
 not the multiple inclusion of one or more elements in a claim renders that claim
 indefinite. The mere fact that a compound may be embraced by more than one member
 of a Markush group recited in the claim does not necessarily render the scope of
 the claim unclear. For example, the Markush group, "selected from the group
 consisting of amino, halogen, nitro, chloro and alkyl" should be acceptable even
 though "halogen" is generic to "chloro." See, e.g., *Eli Lilly & Co.
 v. Teva Parenteral Meds.,* 845 F.3d 1357, 1371,121 USPQ2d 1277, 1287
 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (redundancy of including both "vitamin B12" and "cyanocobalamin"
 (which were recognized on the record as referencing the same compound) within a
 Markush group of methylmalonic acid lowering agents did not render the claims
 indefinite).
 

**II.** **"OPTIONALLY"**Another alternative format which requires some analysis before
 concluding whether or not the language is indefinite involves the use of the term
 "optionally." In *Ex parte**Cordova,* 10 USPQ2d 1949 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989) the
 language "containing A, B, and optionally C" was considered acceptable alternative
 language because there was no ambiguity as to which alternatives are covered by
 the claim. A similar holding was reached with regard to the term "optionally" in
 *Ex parte**Wu,* 10 USPQ2d 2031 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). In the
 instance where the list of potential alternatives can vary and ambiguity arises,
 then it is proper to make a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.

# 2173.05(i) Negative Limitations [R-08.2017]


The current view of the courts is that there is nothing inherently
 ambiguous or uncertain about a negative limitation. So long as the boundaries of the
 patent protection sought are set forth definitely, albeit negatively, the claim
 complies with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. Some older cases were critical
 of negative limitations because they tended to define the invention in terms of what
 it was not, rather than pointing out the invention. Thus, the court observed that the
 limitation "R is an alkenyl radical other than 2-butenyl and 2,4-pentadienyl" was a
 negative limitation that rendered the claim indefinite because it was an attempt to
 claim the invention by excluding what the inventors did not invent rather than
 distinctly and particularly pointing out what they did invent. *In re
 Schechter,* 205 F.2d 185, 98 USPQ 144 (CCPA 1953).
 


A claim which recited the limitation "said homopolymer being free
 from the proteins, soaps, resins, and sugars present in natural Hevea rubber" in
 order to exclude the characteristics of the prior art product, was considered
 definite because each recited limitation was definite. *In re
 Wakefield,* 422 F.2d 897, 899, 904, 164 USPQ 636, 638, 641 (CCPA 1970).
 In addition, the court found that the negative limitation "incapable of forming a dye
 with said oxidized developing agent" was definite because the boundaries of the
 patent protection sought were clear. *In re Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170
 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971).
 


Any negative limitation or exclusionary proviso must have basis in
 the original disclosure. If alternative elements are positively recited in the
 specification, they may be explicitly excluded in the claims. See *In re
 Johnson,* 558 F.2d 1008, 1019, 194 USPQ 187, 196 (CCPA 1977) ("[the]
 specification, having described the whole, necessarily described the part
 remaining."). See also *Ex parte Grasselli,* 231 USPQ 393 (Bd. App.
 1983), *aff’d mem.,* 738 F.2d 453 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In describing
 alternative features, the applicant need not articulate advantages or disadvantages
 of each feature in order to later exclude the alternative features. See
 *Inphi Corporation v. Netlist, Inc.,* 805 F.3d 1350, 1356-57, 116
 USPQ2d 2006, 2010-11 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The mere absence of a positive recitation is
 not basis for an exclusion. Any claim containing a negative limitation which does not
 have basis in the original disclosure should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, as failing to comply with the written description requirement. Note that a
 lack of literal basis in the specification for a negative limitation may not be
 sufficient to establish a *prima facie* case for lack of descriptive
 support. *Ex parte Parks,* 30 USPQ2d 1234, 1236 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1993). See **[MPEP
 § 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** - **[§ 2163.07(b)](s2163.html#d0e215198)** for a discussion of the
 written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph.
 




# 2173.05(j) Old Combination [R-11.2013]

**A CLAIM SHOULD NOT BE REJECTED ON THE GROUND OF OLD COMBINATION**With the passage of the 1952 Patent Act, the courts and the Board
 have taken the view that a rejection based on the principle of old combination is
 NO LONGER VALID. Claims should be considered proper so long as they comply with
 the provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. 
 


A rejection on the basis of old combination was based on the
 principle applied in *Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner
 Corp.,* 303 U.S. 545, 37 USPQ 1 (1938). The principle was that an
 inventor who made an improvement or contribution to but one element of a generally
 old combination, should not be able to obtain a patent on the entire combination
 including the new and improved element. A rejection required the citation of a
 single reference which broadly disclosed a combination of the claimed elements
 functionally cooperating in substantially the same manner to produce substantially
 the same results as that of the claimed combination. The case of *In re
 Hall,* 208 F.2d 370, 100 USPQ 46 (CCPA 1953) illustrates an
 application of this principle.
 


The court pointed out in *In re Bernhart,* 417
 F.2d 1395, 163 USPQ 611 (CCPA 1969) that the statutory language (particularly
 point out and distinctly claim) is the only proper basis for an old combination
 rejection, and in applying the rejection, that language determines what an
 applicant has a right and obligation to do. A majority opinion of the Board of
 Appeals held that Congress removed the underlying rationale of *Lincoln
 Engineering* in the 1952 Patent Act, and thereby effectively
 legislated that decision out of existence. *Ex parte Barber,* 187
 USPQ 244 (Bd. App. 1974). Finally, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
 in *Radio Steel and Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc.,* 731 F.2d
 840, 221 USPQ 657 (Fed. Cir. 1984), followed the **Bernhart** case, and ruled that a claim was not invalid under *Lincoln
 Engineering* because the claim complied with the requirements of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. Accordingly, a claim should not be
 rejected on the ground of old combination.
 




# 2173.05(k) Aggregation [R-08.2012]


A claim should not be rejected on the ground of "aggregation."
 *In re Gustafson,* 331 F.2d 905, 141 USPQ 585 (CCPA 1964) (an
 applicant is entitled to know whether the claims are being rejected under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, **[102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, or
 **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**); *In re Collier,* 397 F.2d 1003, 1006,
 158 USPQ 266, 268 (CCPA 1968) ("[A] rejection for ‘aggregation’ is
 non-statutory.").
 


If a claim omits essential matter or fails to interrelate essential
 elements of the invention as defined by applicant(s) in the specification, see
 **[MPEP
 § 2172.01](s2172.html#d0e217526)**.
 





# 2173.05(l) [Reserved]





# 2173.05(m) Prolix [R-08.2012]


Examiners should reject claims as prolix only when they contain such
 long recitations or unimportant details that the scope of the claimed invention is
 rendered indefinite thereby. Claims are rejected as prolix when they contain long
 recitations that the metes and bounds of the claimed subject matter cannot be
 determined.
 




# 2173.05(n) Multiplicity [R-11.2013]



#### *37 CFR 1.75  Claim(s).*


* (a) The specification must conclude with a claim particularly
 pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant
 regards as his invention or discovery.
* (b) More than one claim may be presented provided they differ
 substantially from each other and are not unduly multiplied.


\*\*\*\*\*



Where, in view of the nature and scope of applicant’s invention,
 applicant presents an unreasonable number of claims which are repetitious and
 multiplied, the net result of which is to confuse rather than to clarify, a rejection
 on undue multiplicity based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, may be appropriate. As noted by
 the court in *In re Chandler,* 319 F.2d 211, 225, 138 USPQ 138, 148
 (CCPA 1963), "applicants should be allowed reasonable latitude in stating their
 claims in regard to number and phraseology employed. The right of applicants to
 freedom of choice in selecting phraseology which truly points out and defines their
 inventions should not be abridged. Such latitude, however, should not be extended to
 sanction that degree of repetition and multiplicity which beclouds definition in a
 maze of confusion. The rule of reason should be practiced and applied on the basis of
 the relevant facts and circumstances in each individual case." See also *In
 re Flint,* 411 F.2d 1353, 1357, 162 USPQ 228, 231 (CCPA 1969). Undue
 multiplicity rejections based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be applied judiciously and
 should be rare. 
 


If an undue multiplicity rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is appropriate, the examiner should contact applicant by telephone
 explaining that the claims are unduly multiplied and will be rejected under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. Note **[MPEP §
 408](s408.html#d0e22768)**. The examiner should also request that applicant select
 a specified number of claims for purpose of examination. If applicant is willing to
 select, by telephone, the claims for examination, an undue multiplicity rejection on
 all the claims based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be made in the next Office
 action along with an action on the merits on the selected claims. If applicant
 refuses to comply with the telephone request, an undue multiplicity rejection of all
 the claims based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be made in the next Office
 action. Applicant’s reply must include a selection of claims for purpose of
 examination, the number of which may not be greater than the number specified by the
 examiner. In response to applicant’s reply, if the examiner adheres to the undue
 multiplicity rejection, it should be repeated and the selected claims will be
 examined on the merits. This procedure preserves applicant’s right to have the
 rejection on undue multiplicity reviewed by the Patent Trail and Appeal Board. 
 


Also, it is possible to reject one claim over an allowed claim if
 they differ only by subject matter old in the art. This ground of rejection is set
 forth in *Ex parte**Whitelaw,* 1915 C.D. 18, 219 O.G. 1237 (Comm’r Pat. 1914). The
 *Ex parte**Whitelaw* doctrine is restricted to cases where the claims are
 unduly multiplied or are substantial duplicates. *Ex parte Kochan,*
 131 USPQ 204, 206 (Bd. App. 1961).
 




# 2173.05(o) Double Inclusion [R-08.2012]


There is no *per se* rule that "double inclusion"
 is improper in a claim. *In re Kelly,* 305 F.2d 909, 916, 134 USPQ
 397, 402 (CCPA 1962) ("Automatic reliance upon a ‘rule against double inclusion’ will
 lead to as many unreasonable interpretations as will automatic reliance upon a ‘rule
 allowing double inclusion’. The governing consideration is not *double
 inclusion,* but rather is what is a reasonable construction of the
 language of the claims."). Older cases, such as *Ex parte White,*
 127 USPQ 261 (Bd. App. 1958) and *Ex parte Clark,* 174 USPQ 40 (Bd.
 App. 1971) should be applied with care, according to the facts of each case.
 


The facts in each case must be evaluated to determine whether or not
 the multiple inclusion of one or more elements in a claim gives rise to
 indefiniteness in that claim. The mere fact that a compound may be embraced by more
 than one member of a Markush group recited in the claim does not lead to any
 uncertainty as to the scope of that claim for either examination or infringement
 purposes. On the other hand, where a claim directed to a device can be read to
 include the same element twice, the claim may be indefinite. *Ex parte
 Kristensen,* 10 USPQ2d 1701 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).
 




# 2173.05(p) Claim Directed to Product-By- Process or Product and
 Process [R-10.2019]


There are many situations where claims are permissively drafted to
 include a reference to more than one statutory class of invention. 
 

**I.** **PRODUCT-BY-PROCESS**A product-by-process claim, which is a product claim that defines
 the claimed product in terms of the process by which it is made, is
 proper.*Purdue Pharma v. Epic Pharma,* 811 F.3d 1345, 1354,
 117 USPQ2d 1733, 1739 (Fed. Cir. 2016); *In re Luck,* 476 F.2d
 650, 177 USPQ 523 (CCPA 1973); *In re Pilkington,* 411 F.2d 1345,
 162 USPQ 145 (CCPA 1969); and *In re Steppan,* 394 F.2d 1013, 156
 USPQ 143 (CCPA 1967). A claim to a device, apparatus, manufacture, or composition
 of matter may contain a reference to the process in which it is intended to be
 used without being objectionable under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, so long as it is clear that the claim is directed to the product and
 not the process.
 


An applicant may present claims of varying scope even if it is
 necessary to describe the claimed product in product-by-process terms. *Ex
 parte**Pantzer,* 176 USPQ 141 (Bd. App. 1972).
 

**II.** **PRODUCT AND PROCESS IN THE SAME CLAIM**A single claim which claims both an apparatus and the method
 steps of using the apparatus is indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. See *In re Katz Interactive Call Processing Patent
 Litigation,* 639 F.3d 1303, 1318, 97 USPQ2d 1737, 1748-49 (Fed. Cir.
 2011). In *Katz,* a claim directed to "[a] system with an
 interface means for providing automated voice messages…to certain of said
 individual callers, *wherein said certain of said individual callers
 digitally enter data*" was determined to be indefinite because the
 italicized claim limitation is not directed to the system, but rather to actions
 of the individual callers, which creates confusion as to when direct infringement
 occurs. *Katz,* 639 F.3d at 1318 (citing *IPXL Holdings
 v. Amazon.com, Inc.,* 430 F.3d 1377, 1384, 77 USPQ2d 1140, 1145 (Fed.
 Cir. 2005), in which a system claim that recited "an input means" and required a
 user to use the input means was found to be indefinite because it was unclear
 "whether infringement … occurs when one creates a system that allows the user [to
 use the input means], or whether infringement occurs when the user actually uses
 the input means."); *Ex parte**Lyell,* 17 USPQ2d 1548 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990) (claim
 directed to an automatic transmission workstand and the method of using it held
 ambiguous and properly rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph).
 


In contrast, when a claim recites a product and
 additional limitations which focus on the capabilities of the system, not the
 specific actions or functions performed by the user, the claim may be definite
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. See *Mastermine Software, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,*
 874 F.3d 1307, 124 USPQ2d 1618 (Fed. Cir. 2017). 
 




# 2173.05(q) "Use" Claims [R-10.2019]


Attempts to claim a process without setting forth any steps involved
 in the process generally raises an issue of indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. For example, a claim which read: "[a] process for using monoclonal
 antibodies of claim 4 to isolate and purify human fibroblast interferon" was held to
 be indefinite because it merely recites a use without any active, positive steps
 delimiting how this use is actually practiced. *Ex parte**Erlich,* 3 USPQ2d 1011 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986). 
 


"Use" claims that do not purport to claim a process, machine,
 manufacture, or composition of matter fail to comply with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 *In re Moreton,* 288 F.2d 708, 709, 129 USPQ 227, 228 (CCPA
 1961)("one cannot claim a new use per se, because it is not among the categories of
 patentable inventions specified in **[35 U.S.C. § 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**"). In *Ex
 parte**Dunki,* 153 USPQ 678 (Bd. App. 1967), the Board held the following
 claim to be an improper definition of a process: "The use of a high carbon austenitic
 iron alloy having a proportion of free carbon as a vehicle brake part subject to
 stress by sliding friction." In *Clinical Products Ltd. v. Brenner,*
 255 F. Supp. 131, 149 USPQ 475 (D.D.C. 1966), the district court held the following
 claim was definite, but that it was not a proper process claim under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**: "The use of a sustained release therapeutic agent in the
 body of ephedrine absorbed upon polystyrene sulfonic acid." 
 


Although a claim should be interpreted in light of the specification
 disclosure, it is generally considered improper to read limitations contained in the
 specification into the claims. See *In re**Prater,* 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (CCPA 1969) and *In re
 Winkhaus,* 527 F.2d 637, 188 USPQ 129 (CCPA 1975), which discuss the
 premise that one cannot rely on the specification to impart limitations to the claim
 that are not recited in the claim. 
 

**I.** **A "USE" CLAIM MAY BE REJECTED UNDER 35 U.S.C 101 AND/OR 112**It is appropriate to reject a claim that recites a use but fails
 to recite steps under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** if the facts support both rejections. For
 failure to recite a claim within one of the statutory classes under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, the appropriate form paragraph is
 **[7.05.01](#fp7.05.01)**. For indefiniteness under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**, the appropriate form paragraph is
 **[7.34.01](#fp7.34.01)**.
 

**II.** **BOARD HELD STEP OF "UTILIZING" WAS NOT INDEFINITE**It is often difficult to draw a fine line between what is
 permissible, and what is objectionable from the perspective of whether a claim is
 definite. In the case of *Ex parte**Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992), the
 Board held that a claim which clearly recited the step of "utilizing" was not
 indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. (Claim was to "A method
 for unloading nonpacked, nonbridging and packed, bridging flowable particle
 catalyst and bead material from the opened end of a reactor tube which comprises
 utilizing the nozzle of claim 7.").
 




# 2173.05(r) Omnibus Claim [R-10.2019]


Some applications are filed with an omnibus claim which reads as
 follows: A device substantially as shown and described. This claim should be rejected
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, because it is indefinite in that it fails to point out what is included or
 excluded by the claim language. See *Ex parte**Fressola,* 27 USPQ2d 1608 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993), for a
 discussion of the history of omnibus claims and an explanation of why omnibus claims
 do not comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph.
 


Such a claim can be rejected using form paragraph
 **[7.35](#fp7.35)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2175](s2175.html#ch2100_d2c184_13a97_15)**. 
 




# 2173.05(s) Reference to Figures or Tables [R-10.2019]


Where possible, claims are to be complete in themselves.
 Incorporation by reference to a specific figure or table "is permitted only in
 exceptional circumstances where there is no practical way to define the invention in
 words and where it is more concise to incorporate by reference than duplicating a
 drawing or table into the claim. Incorporation by reference is a necessity doctrine,
 not for applicant’s convenience." *Ex parte**Fressola,* 27 USPQ2d 1608, 1609 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993)
 (citations omitted). 
 


Reference characters corresponding to elements recited in the
 detailed description and the drawings may be used in conjunction with the recitation
 of the same element or group of elements in the claims. Generally, the presence or
 absence of such reference characters does not affect the scope of a claim. See
 **[MPEP §
 608.01(m)](s608.html#d0e45061)** for information pertaining to the treatment of
 reference characters in a claim.
 




# 2173.05(t) Chemical Formula [R-11.2013]


Claims to chemical compounds and compositions containing chemical
 compounds often use formulas that depict the chemical structure of the compound.
 These structures should not be considered indefinite nor speculative in the absence
 of evidence that the assigned formula is in error. The absence of corroborating
 spectroscopic or other data cannot be the basis for finding the structure indefinite.
 See *Ex parte**Morton,* 134 USPQ 407 (Bd. App. 1961), and *Ex
 parte**Sobin,* 139 USPQ 528 (Bd. App. 1962). 
 


A claim to a chemical compound is not indefinite merely because a
 structure is not presented or because a partial structure is presented. For example,
 the claim language at issue in *In re**Fisher,* 427 F.2d 833, 166 USPQ 18 (CCPA 1970) referred to a
 chemical compound as a "polypeptide of at least 24 amino acids having the following
 sequence." A rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, for failure to identify the entire structure was reversed and the court
 held: "While the absence of such a limitation obviously broadens the claim and raises
 questions of sufficiency of disclosure, it does not render the claim indefinite."
 Chemical compounds may be claimed by a name that adequately describes the material to
 one skilled in the art. See *Martin**v.**Johnson,* 454 F.2d 746, 172 USPQ 391 (CCPA 1972). A compound of
 unknown structure may be claimed by a combination of physical and chemical
 characteristics. See *Ex parte**Brian,* 118 USPQ 242 (Bd. App. 1958). A compound may also be
 claimed in terms of the process by which it is made without raising an issue of
 indefiniteness. 
 




# 2173.05(u) Trademarks or Trade Names in a Claim [R-11.2013]


The presence of a trademark or trade name in a claim is not,
 *per se,* improper under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, but the claim should be carefully analyzed to determine how the mark or
 name is used in the claim. It is important to recognize that a trademark or trade
 name is used to identify a source of goods, and not the goods themselves. Thus a
 trademark or trade name does not identify or describe the goods associated with the
 trademark or trade name. See definitions of trademark and trade name in
 **[MPEP §
 608.01(v)](s608.html#d0e47416)**. 
 


If the trademark or trade name is used in a claim as a limitation to
 identify or describe a particular material or product, the claim does not comply with
 the requirements of the **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. *Ex parte**Simpson,* 218 USPQ 1020 (Bd. App. 1982). The claim scope is
 uncertain since the trademark or trade name cannot be used properly to identify any
 particular material or product. In fact, the value of a trademark would be lost to
 the extent that it became descriptive of a product, rather than used as an
 identification of a source or origin of a product. Thus, the use of a trademark or
 trade name in a claim to identify or describe a material or product would not only
 render a claim indefinite, but would also constitute an improper use of the trademark
 or trade name.
 


If a trademark or trade name appears in a claim and is not intended
 as a limitation in the claim, the question of why it is in the claim should be
 addressed. If its presence in the claim causes confusion as to the scope of the
 claim, then the claim should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 




# 2173.05(v) Mere Function of Machine [R-11.2013]


Process or method claims are not subject to rejection by U.S. Patent
 and Trademark Office examiners under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, solely on the ground that they
 define the inherent function of a disclosed machine or apparatus. *In
 re**Tarczy-Hornoch,* 397 F.2d 856, 158 USPQ 141 (CCPA 1968). The court
 in *Tarczy-Hornoch* held that a process claim, otherwise patentable,
 should not be rejected merely because the application of which it is a part discloses
 an apparatus which will inherently carry out the recited steps.
 





# 2173.06 Practice Compact Prosecution [R-07.2015]

**I.** **INTERPRET THE CLAIM AND APPLY ART WITH AN EXPLANATION OF HOW AN INDEFINITE
 TERM IS INTERPRETED**The goal of examination is to clearly articulate any
 rejection early in the prosecution process so that the applicant has the chance to
 provide evidence of patentability and otherwise reply completely at the earliest
 opportunity. See **[MPEP §
 706](s706.html#d0e57969)**. Under the principles of compact prosecution, the
 examiner should review each claim for compliance with every statutory requirement for
 patentability in the initial review of the application and identify all of the
 applicable grounds of rejection in the first Office action to avoid unnecessary
 delays in the prosecution of the application. See **[37 CFR 1.104(a)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322138)** ("On taking up
 an application for examination or a patent in a reexamination proceeding, the
 examiner shall make a thorough study thereof and shall make a thorough investigation
 of the available prior art relating to the subject matter of the claimed invention.
 The examination shall be complete with respect both to compliance of the application
 . . . with the applicable statutes and rules and to the patentability of the
 invention as claimed, as well as with respect to matters of form, unless otherwise
 indicated."). 
 


Thus, when the examiner determines that a claim term or
 phrase renders the claim indefinite, the examiner should make a rejection based on
 indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, as well as a rejection(s) in view
 of the prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** that renders the prior art applicable based on the
 examiner’s interpretation of the claim. See *In re Packard,* 751
 F.3d 1307, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (stating that the *prima facie*
 case is appropriately used for making an indefiniteness rejection). When making a
 rejection over prior art in these circumstances, it is important that the
 **examiner state on the record how the claim term or phrase is being
 interpreted** with respect to the prior art applied in the rejection. By
 rejecting each claim on all reasonable grounds available, the examiner can avoid
 piecemeal examination. See **[MPEP § 707.07(g)](s707.html#d0e75512)** ("Piecemeal
 examination should be avoided as much as possible. The examiner ordinarily should
 reject each claim on all valid grounds available . . . ."). 
 

**II.** **PRIOR ART REJECTION OF CLAIM REJECTED AS INDEFINITE**All words in a claim must be considered in judging the patentability
 of a claim against the prior art. *In re Wilson,* 424 F.2d 1382, 165
 USPQ 494 (CCPA 1970). The fact that terms may be indefinite does not make the claim
 obvious over the prior art. When the terms of a claim are considered to be
 indefinite, at least two approaches to the examination of an indefinite claim
 relative to the prior art are possible.
 


First, where the degree of uncertainty is not great, and where the
 claim is subject to more than one interpretation and at least one interpretation
 would render the claim unpatentable over the prior art, an appropriate course of
 action would be for the examiner to enter two rejections: (A) a rejection based on
 indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph; and (B) a rejection over the
 prior art based on the interpretation of the claims which renders the prior art
 applicable. See, e.g., *Ex parte Ionescu,* 222 USPQ 537 (Bd. App.
 1984). When making a rejection over prior art in these circumstances, it is important
 for the examiner to point out how the claim is being interpreted. Second, where there
 is a great deal of confusion and uncertainty as to the proper interpretation of the
 limitations of a claim, it would not be proper to reject such a claim on the basis of
 prior art. As stated in *In re**Steele,* 305 F.2d 859, 134 USPQ 292 (CCPA 1962), a rejection under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should not be based on considerable speculation about the
 meaning of terms employed in a claim or assumptions that must be made as to the scope
 of the claims. 
 


The first approach is recommended from an examination standpoint
 because it avoids piecemeal examination in the event that the examiner’s
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph rejection is not affirmed, and may give
 applicant a better appreciation for relevant prior art if the claims are redrafted to
 avoid the **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph rejection.

# 2173.01 Interpreting the Claims [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the
 relevant date is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the
 "time of the invention," which is only applicable to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*


A fundamental principle contained in **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is that applicants are their own lexicographers. They can define in the claims
 what the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention essentially in whatever
 terms they choose so long as any special meaning assigned to a term is clearly set forth
 in the specification. See **[MPEP § 2111.01.](s2111.html#d0e200409)** Applicant may use functional language,
 alternative expressions, negative limitations, or any style of expression or format of
 claim which makes clear the boundaries of the subject matter for which protection is
 sought. As noted by the court in *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 160
 USPQ 226 (CCPA 1971), a claim may not be rejected solely because of the type of language
 used to define the subject matter for which patent protection is sought.
 

**I.** **BROADEST REASONABLE INTERPRETATION**The first step to examining a claim to determine if
 the language is definite is to fully understand the subject matter of the invention
 disclosed in the application and to ascertain the boundaries of that subject matter
 encompassed by the claim. During examination, a claim must be given its broadest
 reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification as it would be
 interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art. Because the applicant has the
 opportunity to amend claims during prosecution, giving a claim its broadest
 reasonable interpretation will reduce the possibility that the claim, once issued,
 will be interpreted more broadly than is justified. In re
 *Yamamoto,* 740 F.2d 1569, 1571, 222 USPQ 934, 936 (Fed. Cir.
 1984); *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed.
 Cir. 1989) ("During patent examination the pending claims must be interpreted as
 broadly as their terms reasonably allow."). The focus of the inquiry regarding the
 meaning of a claim should be what would be reasonable from the perspective of one of
 ordinary skill in the art. *In re Suitco Surface, Inc.,* 603 F.3d
 1255, 1260, 94 USPQ2D 1640, 1644 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *In re Buszard,*
 504 F.3d 1364, 84 USPQ2d 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In *Buszard,* the
 claim was directed to a flame retardant composition comprising a flexible
 polyurethane foam reaction mixture. *Buszard,* 504 F.3d at 1365, 84
 USPQ2d at 1749. The Federal Circuit found that the Board’s interpretation that
 equated a "flexible" foam with a crushed "rigid" foam was not reasonable.
 *Id.* at 1367, 84 USPQ2d at 1751. Persuasive argument was
 presented that persons experienced in the field of polyurethane foams know that a
 flexible mixture is different than a rigid foam mixture. *Id.* at
 1366, 84 USPQ2d at 1751. See **[MPEP § 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** for a full discussion of
 broadest reasonable interpretation. 
 


Under a broadest reasonable interpretation, words of
 the claim must be given their plain meaning, unless such meaning is inconsistent with
 the specification. The plain meaning of a term means the ordinary and customary
 meaning given to the term by those of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the
 invention. The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced by a variety
 of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the specification,
 drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the meaning of a
 claim term is the specification - the greatest clarity is obtained when the
 specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. The presumption that a term
 is given its ordinary and customary meaning may be rebutted by the applicant by
 clearly setting forth a different definition of the term in the specification.
 *In re Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed.
 Cir. 1997) (the USPTO looks to the ordinary use of the claim terms taking into
 account definitions or other "enlightenment" contained in the written description);
 But c.f. *In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr.,* 367 F.3d 1359, 1369,
 70 USPQ2d 1827, 1834 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("We have cautioned against reading limitations
 into a claim from the preferred embodiment described in the specification, even if it
 is the only embodiment described, absent clear disclaimer in the specification.");
 *In re Bigio,* 381 F.3d 1320, 1325, 72 USPQ2d 1209, 1211 (Fed.
 Cir. 2004) (The claims at issue were drawn to a "hair brush." The court upheld the
 Board’s refusal to import from the specification a limitation that would apply the
 term only to hairbrushes for the scalp. "[T]his court counsels the PTO to avoid the
 temptation to limit broad claim terms solely on the basis of specification
 passages."). When the specification sets a clear path to the claim language, the
 scope of the claims is more easily determined and the public notice function of the
 claims is best served. See **[MPEP § 2111.01](s2111.html#d0e200409)** for a full discussion
 of the plain meaning of claim language.
 


If an Office action has issued where the plain
 meaning of the claim terms was used, applicant may point out that the term has been
 given a special definition. Since there is a presumption that claim terms are given
 their plain meaning, and the use of special definitions is an exception, the
 applicant must point to where the specification as filed provides a clear and
 intentional use of a special definition for the claim term to be treated as having a
 special definition.
 


An applicant may not add a special definition or
 disavowal after the filing date of the application. However, an applicant may point
 out or explain in remarks where the specification as filed contains a special
 definition or disavowal. 
 

**II.** **DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT EACH CLAIM LIMITATION INVOKES 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or
 Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph** As part of the claim interpretation analysis,
 examiners should determine whether each limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph or not. If the claim limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, the claim limitation must "be construed to cover the corresponding
 structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof."
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph; see also *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29
 USPQ2d 1845, 1849 (Fed. Cir. 1994) *(en banc)* ("[W]e hold that
 paragraph six applies regardless of the context in which the interpretation of
 means-plus-function language arises, i.e., whether as part of a patentability
 determination in the PTO or as part of a validity or infringement determination in a
 court."). See **[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection I. for more information regarding the
 determination of whether a limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C.

# 2173.02 Determining Whether Claim Language is Definite [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the
 relevant date is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the
 "time the invention was made," which is only applicable to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*


 During prosecution, applicant has an opportunity and a
 duty to amend ambiguous claims to clearly and precisely define the metes and bounds of
 the claimed invention. The claim places the public on notice of the scope of the
 patentee’s right to exclude. See, e.g., *Johnson & Johnston Assoc. Inc. v.
 R.E. Serv. Co.,* 285 F.3d 1046, 1052, 62 USPQ2d 1225, 1228 (Fed. Cir. 2002)

 A decision on whether a claim is indefinite under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph requires a determination of whether those skilled in the art would understand
 what is claimed when the claim is read in light of the specification.
 *Power-One, Inc. v. Artesyn Techs., Inc.,* 599 F.3d 1343, 1350, 94
 USPQ2d 1241, 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *Orthokinetics, Inc. v. Safety Travel
 Chairs,* Inc., 806 F.2d 1565, 1 USPQ2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In
 *Orthokinetics,* a claim directed to a wheel chair included the
 phrase "so dimensioned as to be insertable through the space between the doorframe of an
 automobile and one of the seats thereof." 806 F.2d at 1568, 1 USPQ2d at 1082. The court
 found the phrase to be as accurate as the subject matter permits, since automobiles are
 of various sizes. *Id.* at 1576, 1 USPQ2d at 1088. "As long as those of
 ordinary skill in the art realized the dimensions could be easily obtained,
 **[§
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, 2d para. requires nothing more." *Id.* Claim
 terms are typically given their ordinary and customary meaning as understood by one of
 ordinary skill in the pertinent art, and the generally understood meaning of particular
 terms may vary from art to art. Therefore, it is important to analyze claim terms in
 view of the application’s specification from the perspective of those skilled in the
 relevant art since a particular term used in one patent or application may not have the
 same meaning when used in a different application. *Medrad, Inc. v. MRI Devices
 Corp.,* 401 F.3d 1313, 1318, 74 USPQ2d 1184, 1188 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
 

**I.** **CLAIMS UNDER EXAMINATION ARE CONSTRUED DIFFERENTLY THAN PATENTED CLAIMS** Patented claims are not given the broadest reasonable
 interpretation during court proceedings involving infringement and validity, and can
 be interpreted based on a fully developed prosecution record. While "absolute
 precision is unattainable" in patented claims, the definiteness requirement "mandates
 clarity." *Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc.,* 527 U.S.
 \_\_\_\_, 110 USPQ2d 1688, 1693 (2014). A court will not find a patented claim indefinite
 unless the claim interpreted in light of the specification and the prosecution
 history fails to "inform those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention
 with reasonable certainty." *Id.* at 1689.
 


The Office does not interpret claims when examining
 patent applications in the same manner as the courts. *In re
 Packard,* 751 F.3d 1307, 1312, 110 USPQ2d 1785, 1788 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
 *In re Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed.
 Cir. 1997); *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 321-22, 13 USPQ2d 1320,
 1321-22 (Fed. Cir. 1989). The Office construes claims by giving them their broadest
 reasonable interpretation during prosecution in an effort to establish a clear record
 of what the applicant intends to claim. Such claim construction during prosecution
 may effectively result in a lower threshold for ambiguity than a court's
 determination. *Packard*, 751 F.3d at 1323-24, 110 USPQ2d at 1796-97
 (Plager, J., concurring). However, applicant has the ability to amend the claims
 during prosecution to ensure that the meaning of the language is clear and definite
 prior to issuance or provide a persuasive explanation (with evidence as necessary)
 that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not consider the claim language
 unclear. *In re Buszard,* 504 F.3d 1364, 1366, 84 USPQ2d 1749, 1750
 (Fed. Cir. 2007)(claims are given their broadest reasonable interpretation during
 prosecution "to facilitate sharpening and clarifying the claims at the application
 stage"); see also *In re Yamamoto,* 740 F.2d 1569, 1571, 222 USPQ
 934, 936 (Fed. Cir. 1984); *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 322, 13
 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989); *Ex parte McAward,* Appeal
 2015-006416 (PTAB Aug. 25, 2017) (precedential). 
 


 See **[MPEP § 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)***et seq.* for a detailed discussion of claim interpretation during
 the examination process. The lower threshold is also applied because the patent
 record is in development and not fixed during examination, and the agency does not
 rely on it for interpreting claims. *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1325
 (Plager, J., concurring). *Burlington Indus. Inc. v. Quigg,* 822
 F.2d 1581, 1583, 3 USPQ2d 1436, 1438 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("Issues of judicial claim
 construction such as arise after patent issuance, for example during infringement
 litigation, have no place in prosecution of pending claims before the PTO, when any
 ambiguity or excessive breadth may be corrected by merely changing the claim.").
 


During examination, after applying the broadest
 reasonable interpretation to the claim, if the metes and bounds of the claimed
 invention are not clear, the claim is indefinite and should be rejected.
 *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1310 ("[W]hen the USPTO has initially
 issued a well-grounded rejection that identifies ways in which language in a claim is
 ambiguous, vague, incoherent, opaque, or otherwise unclear in describing and defining
 the claimed invention, and thereafter the applicant fails to provide a satisfactory
 response, the USPTO can properly reject the claim as failing to meet the statutory
 requirements of **[§ 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**.");
 *Zletz,* 893 F.2d at 322, 13 USPQ2d at 1322. For example, if the
 language of a claim, given its broadest reasonable interpretation, is such that a
 person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would read it with more than one
 reasonable interpretation, then a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is appropriate. Examiners, however, are cautioned against confusing claim
 breadth with claim indefiniteness. A broad claim is not indefinite merely because it
 encompasses a wide scope of subject matter provided the scope is clearly defined.
 Instead, a claim is indefinite when the boundaries of the protected subject matter
 are not clearly delineated and the scope is unclear. For example, a genus claim that
 covers multiple species is broad, but is not indefinite because of its breadth, which
 is otherwise clear. But a genus claim that could be interpreted in such a way that it
 is not clear which species are covered would be indefinite (e.g., because there is
 more than one reasonable interpretation of what species are included in the claim).
 See **[MPEP §
 2173.05(h)](s2173.html#d0e218467)**, subsection I., for more information regarding
 the determination of whether a Markush claim satisfies the requirements of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 

**II.** **THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS OF CLARITY AND PRECISION**The examiner’s focus during examination of claims for compliance
 with the requirement for definiteness of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is whether the claim meets the threshold requirements of clarity and
 precision set forth in the statute, not whether more suitable language or modes of
 expression are available. When the examiner is satisfied that patentable subject
 matter is disclosed, and it is apparent to the examiner that the claims are directed
 to such patentable subject matter, the examiner should allow claims which define the
 patentable subject matter with the required degree of particularity and distinctness.
 Some latitude in the manner of expression and the aptness of terms should be
 permitted so long as **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, is satisfied. Examiners are
 encouraged to suggest claim language to applicants to improve the clarity or
 precision of the language used, but should not insist on their own preferences if
 other modes of expression selected by applicants satisfy the statutory
 requirement.
 


The essential inquiry pertaining to this requirement is whether the
 claims set out and circumscribe a particular subject matter with a reasonable degree
 of clarity and particularity. "As the statutory language of ‘particular[ity]' and
 'distinct[ness]' indicates, claims are required to be cast in clear—as opposed to
 ambiguous, vague, indefinite—terms. It is the claims that notify the public of what
 is within the protections of the patent, and what is not."
 *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1313. Definiteness of claim language must
 be analyzed, not in a vacuum, but in light of:
 


* (A) The content of the particular application disclosure;
* (B) The teachings of the prior art; and
* (C) The claim interpretation that would be given by one possessing
 the ordinary level of skill in the pertinent art at the time the invention was
 made.


In reviewing a claim for compliance with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, the examiner must consider the claim as a whole to determine whether the
 claim apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves
 the notice function required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, by providing clear warning to
 others as to what constitutes infringement of the patent. See, e.g., *Solomon
 v. Kimberly-Clark Corp.,* 216 F.3d 1372, 1379, 55 USPQ2d 1279, 1283 (Fed.
 Cir. 2000). See also *In re Larsen,* 10 Fed. App'x 890 (Fed. Cir.
 2001) (The preamble of the *Larsen* claim recited only a hanger and
 a loop but the body of the claim positively recited a linear member. The court
 observed that the totality of all the limitations of the claim and their interaction
 with each other must be considered to ascertain the inventor’s contribution to the
 art. Upon review of the claim in its entirety, the court concluded that the claim at
 issue apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves
 the notice function required by **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**.).
 


If the language of the claim is such that a person of ordinary skill
 in the art could not interpret the metes and bounds of the claim so as to understand
 how to avoid infringement, a rejection of the claim under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is appropriate. See *Morton Int’l, Inc. v. Cardinal Chem.
 Co.,* 5 F.3d 1464, 1470, 28 USPQ2d 1190, 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1993). However,
 if the language used by applicant satisfies the statutory requirements of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, the claim must not be rejected under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. 
 


Examiners should note that Office policy is not to employ
 *per se* rules to make technical rejections. Examples of claim
 language which have been held to be indefinite set forth in **[MPEP § 2173.05(d)](s2173.html#d0e218251)**
 are fact specific and should not be applied as *per
 se* rules. 
 

**III.** **RESOLVING INDEFINITE CLAIM LANGUAGE*** 

***A.******Examiner Must Establish a Clear Record***Examiners are urged to carefully carry out their
 responsibilities to see that the application file contains a complete and accurate
 picture of the Office’s consideration of the patentability of an application. See
 **[MPEP §
 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection I. In order to provide a complete
 application file history and to enhance the clarity of the prosecution history
 record, an examiner should provide clear explanations of all actions taken during
 prosecution of the application. See **[MPEP § 707.07(f)](s707.html#d0e74734)**. Thus, when a
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, is appropriate based on the
 examiner’s determination that a claim term or phrase is *prima
 facie* indefinite, the examiner should clearly communicate in an
 Office action any findings and reasons which support the rejection and avoid a
 mere conclusion that the claim term or phrase is indefinite. See
 **[MPEP §
 706.03](s706.html#d0e66074)** and **[MPEP § 707.07(g)](s707.html#d0e75512)**.
 


**[MPEP §
 2173.05](s2173.html#d0e217809)** provides numerous examples of rationales that
 may support a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, such as functional claim
 limitations, relative terminology/terms of degree, lack of antecedent basis, etc.
 Only by providing a complete explanation in the Office action as to the basis for
 determining why a particular term or phrase used in the claim is "vague and
 indefinite" will the examiner enhance the clarity of the prosecution history
 record. 
 

***B.******An Office Action Should Provide a Sufficient Explanation***The Office action must set forth the specific term
 or phrase that is indefinite and why the metes and bounds are unclear. Since a
 rejection requires the applicant to respond by explaining why claim language would
 be recognized by a person of ordinary skill in the art as definite or by amending
 the claim, the Office action should provide enough information for the applicant
 to prepare a meaningful response. "Because claims delineate the patentee’s right
 to exclude, the patent statute requires that the scope of the claims be
 sufficiently definite to inform the public of the bounds of the protected
 invention, i.e., what subject matter is covered by the exclusive rights of the
 patent." *Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v. M-I LLC,* 514 F.3d
 1244, 1249, 85 USPQ2d 1654, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Thus, claims are given their
 broadest reasonable interpretation during prosecution "to facilitate sharpening
 and clarifying the claims at the application stage" when claims are readily
 changed. *In re Buszard,* 504 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2007);
 see also *In re Yamamoto,* 740 F.2d 1569, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1984);
 *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 322, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed.
 Cir. 1989). 
 


To comply with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, applicants are required to make the terms that are used to define the
 invention clear and precise, so that the metes and bounds of the subject matter
 that will be protected by the patent grant can be ascertained. See
 **[MPEP §
 2173.05(a)](s2173.html#d0e217839)**, subsection I. It is important that a person
 of ordinary skill in the art be able to interpret the metes and bounds of the
 claims so as to understand how to avoid infringement of the patent that ultimately
 issues from the application being examined. See **[MPEP § 2173.02](s2173.html#d0e217598)**,
 subsection II (citing *Morton Int ’l, Inc. v. Cardinal Chem.
 Co.,* 5 F.3d 1464, 1470 (Fed. Cir. 1993)); see also
 *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1249, 85 USPQ2d at
 1658 ("Otherwise, competitors cannot avoid infringement, defeating the public
 notice function of patent claims."). Examiners should bear in mind that "[a]n
 essential purpose of patent examination is to fashion claims that are precise,
 clear, correct, and unambiguous. Only in this way can uncertainties of claim scope
 be removed, as much as possible, during the administrative process."
 *Zletz,* 893 F.2d at 322, 13 USPQ2d at 1322. 
 


Accordingly, when rejecting a claim as
 *prima facie* indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, the examiner should provide enough information in the Office action to
 permit applicant to make a meaningful response, as the indefiniteness rejection
 requires the applicant to explain or provide evidence as to why the claim language
 is not indefinite or amend the claim. For example, in making a *prima
 facie* case of indefiniteness, the examiner should point out the
 specific term or phrase that is indefinite, explain in detail why such term or
 phrase renders the metes and bounds of the claim scope unclear and, whenever
 practicable, indicate how the indefiniteness issues may be resolved to overcome
 the rejection. See **[MPEP § 707.07(d)](s707.html#d0e74673)**. If the applicant does not adequately
 respond to the *prima facie* case, the examiner may make the
 indefiniteness rejection final. *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1312.
 


The focus during the examination of claims for
 compliance with the requirement for definiteness under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is whether the claim meets the threshold requirements of clarity and
 precision, not whether more suitable language or modes of expression are
 available. See **[MPEP
 § 2173.02](s2173.html#d0e217598)**, subsection II. Examiners are encouraged to
 suggest claim language to applicants to improve the clarity or precision of the
 language used, but should not insist on their own preferences if other modes of
 expression selected by applicants satisfy the statutory requirement. Furthermore,
 when the examiner determines that more information is necessary to ascertain the
 meaning of a claim term, a requirement for information under **[37 CFR 1.105](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322262)**
 may be appropriate. See **[MPEP § 704.10](s704.html#d0e55758)** regarding
 requirements for information. 
 


It is highly desirable to have applicants resolve
 ambiguity by amending the claims during prosecution of the application rather than
 attempting to resolve the ambiguity in subsequent litigation of the issued patent.
 *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255. Thus, in
 response to an examiner’s rejection for indefiniteness, an applicant may resolve
 the ambiguity by amending the claim, or by providing a persuasive explanation on
 the record that a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would not consider
 the claim language unclear. *In re Packard,* 751 F.3d 1307, 1311
 (Fed. Cir. 2014). For the latter option, in some cases, it may be necessary for
 the applicant to provide a separate definition (such as from an art-recognized
 dictionary) to show how the ordinarily-skilled artisan would have understood the
 claim language at issue. *Id.*


If the examiner considers applicant’s arguments
 and/or amendments to be persuasive, the examiner should indicate in the next
 Office communication that the previous rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, has been withdrawn and provide an explanation as to what prompted the
 change in the examiner’s position (e.g., by making specific reference to portions
 of applicant’s remarks). 
 


By providing an explanation as to the action taken, the examiner
 will enhance the clarity of the prosecution history record. As noted by the
 Supreme Court in *Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki
 Co.,* 535 U.S. 722, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 1838, 62 USPQ2d 1705, 1710 (2002),
 a clear and complete prosecution file record is important in that "[p]rosecution
 history estoppel requires that the claims of a patent be interpreted in light of
 the proceedings in the PTO during the application process." In
 *Festo,* the Court held that "a narrowing amendment made to
 satisfy any requirement of the Patent Act may give rise to an estoppel." With
 respect to amendments made to comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, the Court stated that "[i]f a **[§ 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**
 amendment is truly cosmetic, then it would not narrow the patent’s scope or raise
 an estoppel. On the other hand, if a **[§ 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** amendment is necessary
 and narrows the patent’s scope—even if only for the purpose of better
 description—estoppel may apply." *Id.* at 1840, 62 USPQ2d at
 1712. The Court further stated that "when the court is unable to determine the
 purpose underlying a narrowing amendment—and hence a rationale for limiting the
 estoppel to the surrender of particular equivalents—the court should presume that
 the patentee surrendered all subject matter between the broader and the narrower
 language…the patentee should bear the burden of showing that the amendment does
 not surrender the particular equivalent in question." *Id.* at
 1842, 62 USPQ2d at 1713. Thus, whenever possible, the examiner should make the
 record clear by providing explicit reasoning for making or withdrawing any
 rejection related to **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph.
 

***C.******Provide Claim Interpretation in Reasons for Allowance When Record is
 Unclear***Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.104(e)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322253)**, if the
 examiner believes that the record of the prosecution as a whole does not make
 clear the reasons for allowing a claim or claims, the examiner may set forth such
 reasoning in reasons for allowance. Further, prior to allowance, the examiner may
 also specify allowable subject matter and provide reasons for indicating such
 allowable subject matter in an Office communication. See **[MPEP § 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**,
 subsection I. One of the primary purposes of **[37 CFR 1.104(e)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322253)** is to improve
 the quality and reliability of issued patents by providing a complete file history
 which should clearly reflect the reasons why the application was allowed. Such
 information facilitates evaluation of the scope and strength of a patent by the
 patentee and the public and may help avoid or simplify subsequent litigation of an
 issued patent. See **[MPEP § 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection I. In meeting the need for
 the application file history to speak for itself, it is incumbent upon the
 examiner in exercising their responsibility to the public to see that the file
 history is complete. See **[MPEP § 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection I. 
 


For example, when allowing a claim based on a claim
 interpretation which might not be readily apparent from the record of the
 prosecution as a whole, the examiner should set forth in reasons for allowance the
 claim interpretation applied in determining that the claim is allowable over the
 prior art. See **[MPEP
 § 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection II.G. This is especially the case
 where the application is allowed after an interview. The examiner should ensure,
 however, that statements of reasons for allowance do not place unwarranted
 interpretations, whether broad or narrow, upon the claims. See
 **[MPEP §
 1302.14](s1302.html#d0e132661)**, subsection I. 
 

***D.******Open Lines of Communication with the Applicant – When Indefiniteness
 Is the Only Issue, Attempt Resolution through an Interview before Resorting
 to a Rejection***Examiners are reminded that interviews can be an
 effective examination tool and are encouraged to initiate an interview with the
 applicant or applicant’s representative at any point during the pendency of an
 application, if the interview can help further prosecution, shorten pendency, or
 provide a benefit to the examiner or applicant. Issues of claim interpretation and
 clarity of scope may lend themselves to resolution through an examiner interview.
 For example, the examiner may initiate an interview to discuss, among other
 issues, the broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim, the meaning of a
 particular claim limitation, and the scope and clarity of preamble language,
 functional language, intended use language, and means-plus-function limitations,
 etc. 
 


An interview can serve to develop and clarify such
 issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant,
 potentially eliminating the need for the examiner to resort to making a rejection
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. The examiner is reminded that the substance of any interview, whether
 in person, by video conference, or by telephone must be made of record in the
 application, whether or not an agreement was reached at the interview. See
 **[MPEP §
 713.04](s713.html#d0e84595)**; see also **[37 CFR 1.2](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313151)** ("The action of the
 Patent and Trademark Office will be based exclusively on the written record in the
 Office. No attention will be paid to any alleged oral promise, stipulation, or
 understanding in relation to which there is disagreement or doubt."). Examples of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** issues that should be made of record after the interview
 include: why the discussed claim term is or is not sufficiently clear; why the
 discussed claim term is or is not inconsistent with the specification; why the
 discussed claim term does or does not invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph (and if it does, the identification of corresponding structure,
 material, or acts in the specification for a **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph limitation); and any claim amendments discussed that would resolve
 identified ambiguities.

# 2173.03 Correspondence Between Specification and Claims [R-08.2017]


The specification should ideally serve as a glossary to the claim terms
 so that the examiner and the public can clearly ascertain the meaning of the claim
 terms. Correspondence between the specification and claims is required by
 **[37 CFR
 1.75(d)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320296)**, which provides that claim terms must find clear
 support or antecedent basis in the specification so that the meaning of the terms may be
 ascertainable by reference to the specification. Glossaries of terms used in the claims
 are a helpful device for ensuring adequate definition of terms used in claims. If the
 specification does not provide the needed support or antecedent basis for the claim
 terms, the specification should be objected to under **[37 CFR 1.75(d)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320296)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 608.01(o)](s608.html#d0e46173)** and **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection IV. Applicant
 will be required to make appropriate amendment to the description to provide clear
 support or antecedent basis for the claim terms provided no new matter is introduced, or
 amend the claim. 
 


A claim, although clear on its face, may also be
 indefinite when a conflict or inconsistency between the claimed subject matter and the
 specification disclosure renders the scope of the claim uncertain as inconsistency with
 the specification disclosure or prior art teachings may make an otherwise definite claim
 take on an unreasonable degree of uncertainty. *In re Moore,* 439 F.2d
 1232, 1235-36, 169 USPQ 236, 239 (CCPA 1971); *In re Cohn,* 438 F.2d
 989, 169 USPQ 95 (CCPA 1971); *In re**Hammack,* 427 F.2d 1378, 166 USPQ 204 (CCPA 1970). For example, a
 claim with a limitation of "the clamp means including a clamp body and first and second
 clamping members, the clamping members being supported by the clamp body" was determined
 to be indefinite because the terms "first and second clamping members" and "clamp body"
 were found to be vague in light of the specification which showed no "clamp member"
 structure being "supported by the clamp body." *In re Anderson,* 1997
 U.S. App. Lexis 167 (Fed. Cir. January 6, 1997) (unpublished). In
 *Cohn,* a claim was directed to a process of treating an aluminum
 surface with an alkali silicate solution and included a further limitation that the
 surface has an "opaque" appearance. *Id.* The specification, meanwhile,
 associated the use of an alkali silicate with a glazed or porcelain-like finish, which
 the specification distinguished from an opaque finish. *Cohn,* 438 F.2d
 at 993. Noting that no claim may be read apart from and independent of the supporting
 disclosure on which it is based, the court found that the claim was internally
 inconsistent based on the description, definitions and examples set forth in the
 specification relating to the appearance of the surface after treatment, and therefore
 indefinite. *Id.*

# 2173.04 Breadth Is Not Indefiniteness [R-10.2019]


Breadth of a claim is not to be equated with indefiniteness.
 *In re**Miller,* 441 F.2d 689, 169 USPQ 597 (CCPA 1971); *In re
 Gardner,* 427 F.2d 786, 788, 166 USPQ 138, 140 (CCPA 1970) ("Breadth is not
 indefiniteness."). A broad claim is not indefinite merely because it encompasses a wide
 scope of subject matter provided the scope is clearly defined. But a claim is indefinite
 when the boundaries of the protected subject matter are not clearly delineated and the
 scope is unclear. For example, a genus claim that covers multiple species is broad, but
 is not indefinite because of its breadth, which is otherwise clear. But a genus claim
 that could be interpreted in such a way that it is not clear which species are covered
 would be indefinite (e.g., because there is more than one reasonable interpretation of
 what species are included in the claim).
 


Undue breadth of the claim may be addressed under different statutory
 provisions, depending on the reasons for concluding that the claim is too broad. If the
 claim is too broad because it does not set forth that which the inventor or a joint
 inventor regards as the invention as evidenced by statements outside of the application
 as filed, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, would be appropriate. If the claim is too
 broad because it is not supported by the original description or by an enabling
 disclosure, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, would be appropriate. If the claim is too
 broad because it reads on the prior art, a rejection under either **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** would be appropriate.

 Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Second Paragraph [R-11.2013]


The following sections are devoted to a discussion of specific topics

 intended to be an exhaustive list of the issues that can arise under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, but are intended to provide guidance in areas that have been addressed with
 some frequency in recent examination practice. The court and Board decisions cited are
 representative. As with all appellate decisions, the results are largely dictated by the
 facts in each case. The use of the same language in a different context may justify a
 different result.

# 2173.05(a) New Terminology [R-07.2015]

**I.** **THE MEANING OF EVERY TERM SHOULD BE APPARENT**The meaning of every term used in a claim should be apparent from
 the prior art or from the specification and drawings at the time the application
 is filed. Claim language may not be "ambiguous, vague, incoherent, opaque, or
 otherwise unclear in describing and defining the claimed invention."
 *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1311. Applicants need not confine
 themselves to the terminology used in the prior art, but are required to make
 clear and precise the terms that are used to define the invention whereby the
 metes and bounds of the claimed invention can be ascertained. During patent
 examination, the pending claims must be given the broadest reasonable
 interpretation consistent with the specification. *In re Morris,*
 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *In re
 Prater,* 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (CCPA 1969). See also
 **[MPEP §
 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** - **[§ 2111.01](s2111.html#d0e200409)**. When the specification
 states the meaning that a term in the claim is intended to have, the claim is
 examined using that meaning, in order to achieve a complete exploration of the
 applicant’s invention and its relation to the prior art. *In re
 Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 13 USPQ2d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 

**II.** **THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AND PRECISION MUST BE BALANCED WITH THE
 LIMITATIONS OF THE LANGUAGE**Courts have recognized that it is not only permissible, but often
 desirable, to use new terms that are frequently more precise in describing and
 defining the new invention. *In re**Fisher,* 427 F.2d 833, 166 USPQ 18 (CCPA 1970). Although it is
 difficult to compare the claimed invention with the prior art when new terms are
 used that do not appear in the prior art, this does not make the new terms
 indefinite. 
 


New terms are often used when a new technology is in its infancy
 or is rapidly evolving. The requirements for clarity and precision must be
 balanced with the limitations of the language and the science. If the claims, read
 in light of the specification, reasonably apprise those skilled in the art both of
 the utilization and scope of the invention, and if the language is as precise as
 the subject matter permits, the statute (**[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph) demands no more. *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1313 ("[H]ow
 much clarity is required necessarily invokes some standard of reasonable precision
 in the use of language in the context of the circumstances."). This does not mean
 that the examiner must accept the best effort of applicant. If the language is not
 considered as precise as the subject matter permits, the examiner should provide
 reasons to support the conclusion of indefiniteness and is encouraged to suggest
 alternatives that would not be subject to rejection.
 

**III.** **TERMS USED CONTRARY TO THEIR ORDINARY MEANING MUST BE CLEARLY REDEFINED IN
 THE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION**Consistent with the well-established axiom in patent law that a
 patentee or applicant is free to be his or her own lexicographer, a patentee or
 applicant may use terms in a manner contrary to or inconsistent with one or more
 of their ordinary meanings if the written description clearly redefines the terms.
 See, e.g., *Process Control Corp. v. HydReclaim Corp.,* 190 F.3d
 1350, 1357, 52 USPQ2d 1029, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("While we have held many times
 that a patentee can act as his own lexicographer to specifically define terms of a
 claim contrary to their ordinary meaning," in such a situation the written
 description must clearly redefine a claim term "so as to put a reasonable
 competitor or one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the patentee
 intended to so redefine that claim term."); *Hormone Research Foundation
 Inc.**v.**Genentech Inc.,* 904 F.2d 1558, 15 USPQ2d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
 Accordingly, when there is more than one meaning for a term, it is incumbent upon
 applicant to make clear which meaning is being relied upon to claim the invention.
 Until the meaning of a term or phrase used in a claim is clear, a rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is appropriate. It is appropriate to compare the meaning of terms given
 in technical dictionaries in order to ascertain the accepted meaning of a term in
 the art. *In re Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971).
 See also **[MPEP
 § 2111.01](s2111.html#d0e200409)**.
 




# 2173.05(b) Relative Terminology [R-08.2017]


The use of relative terminology in claim language, including terms
 of degree, does not automatically render the claim indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. *Seattle Box Co., Inc. v. Industrial Crating & Packing,
 Inc.,* 731 F.2d 818, 221 USPQ 568 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Acceptability of the
 claim language depends on whether one of ordinary skill in the art would understand
 what is claimed, in light of the specification.
 

**I.** **TERMS OF DEGREE**Terms of degree are not necessarily indefinite.
 "Claim language employing terms of degree has long been found definite where it
 provided enough certainty to one of skill in the art when read in the context of
 the invention." *Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,* 766 F.3d
 1364, 1370, 112 USPQ2d 1188, 1192-93 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (citing *Eibel
 Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co.,* 261 U.S. 45, 65-66
 (1923) (finding ‘substantial pitch’ sufficiently definite because one skilled in
 the art ‘had no difficulty … in determining what was the substantial pitch needed’
 to practice the invention)). Thus, when a term of degree is used in the claim, the
 examiner should determine whether the specification provides some standard for
 measuring that degree. *Hearing Components, Inc. v. Shure Inc.,*
 600 F.3d 1357, 1367, 94 USPQ2d 1385, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *Enzo Biochem,
 Inc., v. Applera Corp.,* 599 F.3d 1325, 1332, 94 USPQ2d 1321, 1326
 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *Seattle Box Co., Inc. v. Indus. Crating & Packing,
 Inc.,* 731 F.2d 818, 826, 221 USPQ 568, 574 (Fed. Cir. 1984). If the
 specification does not provide some standard for measuring that degree, a
 determination must be made as to whether one of ordinary skill in the art could
 nevertheless ascertain the scope of the claim (e.g., a standard that is recognized
 in the art for measuring the meaning of the term of degree). For example, in
 *Ex parte Oetiker,* 23 USPQ2d 1641 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992), the phrases "relatively shallow," "of the order of," "the order of about
 5mm," and "substantial portion" were held to be indefinite because the
 specification lacked some standard for measuring the degrees intended.
 


The claim is not indefinite if the specification
 provides examples or teachings that can be used to measure a degree even without a
 precise numerical measurement (e.g., a figure that provides a standard for
 measuring the meaning of the term of degree). See, e.g., *Interval
 Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,* 766 F.3d 1364, 1371-72, 112 USPQ2d 1188,
 1193 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (observing that although there is no absolute or
 mathematical precision required, "[t]he claims, when read in light of the
 specification and the prosecution history, must provide objective boundaries for
 those of skill in the art"). 
 


During prosecution, an applicant may also overcome
 an indefiniteness rejection by providing evidence that the meaning of the term of
 degree can be ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art when reading the
 disclosure. For example, in *Enzo Biochem,* the applicant
 submitted a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** showing examples
 that met the claim limitation and examples that did not. *Enzo
 Biochem,* 599 F.3d at 1335, 94 USPQ2d at 1328 (noting that applicant
 overcame an indefiniteness rejection over "not interfering substantially" claim
 language by submitting a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** listing eight
 specific linkage groups that applicant declared did not substantially interfere
 with hybridization or detection). 
 


 Even if the specification uses the same term of
 degree as in the claim, a rejection is proper if the scope of the term is not
 understood when read in light of the specification. While, as a general
 proposition, broadening modifiers are standard tools in claim drafting in order to
 avoid reliance on the doctrine of equivalents in infringement actions, when the
 scope of the claim is unclear a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is proper. See *In re Wiggins,* 488 F. 2d 538, 541,
 179 USPQ 421, 423 (CCPA 1973).
 


When relative terms are used in claims wherein the improvement
 over the prior art rests entirely upon size or weight of an element in a
 combination of elements, the adequacy of the disclosure of a standard is of
 greater criticality.
 

**II.** **REFERENCE TO AN OBJECT THAT IS VARIABLE MAY RENDER A CLAIM
 INDEFINITE**A claim may be rendered indefinite by reference to an object that
 is variable. See, e.g., *Ex parte Miyazaki,* 89 USPQ2d 1207 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 2008) (precedential) and *Ex parte
 Brummer,* 12 USPQ2d 1653 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). In
 *Miyazaki,* the Board held that claims to a large printer were
 not sufficiently definite because:
 



> 
> The language of claim 1 attempts to claim the
>  height of the paper feeding unit in relation to a user of a specific height who
>  is performing operations on the printer.... Claim 1 fails to specify, however,
>  a positional relationship of the user and the printer to each other. 
>  
> 
> 
> 


*Miyazaki,* 89 USPQ2d at 1212. In *Brummer,* the
 Board held that a limitation in a claim to a bicycle that recited "said front and
 rear wheels so spaced as to give a wheelbase that is between 58 percent and 75
 percent of the height of the rider that the bicycle was designed for" was
 indefinite because the relationship of parts was not based on any known standard
 for sizing a bicycle to a rider, but on a rider of unspecified build.
 *Brummer,* 12 USPQ2d at 1655.
 


On the other hand, a claim limitation specifying
 that a certain part of a pediatric wheelchair be "so dimensioned as to be
 insertable through the space between the doorframe of an automobile and one of the
 seats" was held to be definite. *Orthokinetics, Inc.**v.**Safety Travel Chairs, Inc.,* 806 F.2d 1565, 1 USPQ2d 1081 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986). The court stated that the phrase "so dimensioned" is as accurate as
 the subject matter permits, noting that the patent law does not require that all
 possible lengths corresponding to the spaces in hundreds of different automobiles
 be listed in the patent, let alone that they be listed in the claims.
 

**III.** **APPROXIMATIONS*** 

***A.******"About"***In determining the range encompassed by the term
 
 "about"
 
 
 , one must
 consider the context of the term as it is used in the specification and claims
 of the application. *Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v. Caraco Pharm. Labs.,
 Ltd.,* 476 F.3d 1321, 1326, 81 USPQ2d 1427, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
 In*W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc.**v.**Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 220 USPQ 303 (Fed. Cir. 1983),
 the court held that a limitation defining the stretch rate of a plastic as
 "exceeding about 10% per second" is definite because infringement could clearly
 be assessed through the use of a stopwatch. However, in another case, the court
 held that claims reciting "at least about" were invalid for indefiniteness
 where there was close prior art and there was nothing in the specification,
 prosecution history, or the prior art to provide any indication as to what
 range of specific activity is covered by the term "about." *Amgen, Inc.* *v.**Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 18 USPQ2d 1016
 (Fed. Cir. 1991).
 

***B.******"Essentially"***The phrase "a silicon dioxide source that is essentially free
 of alkali metal" was held to be definite because the specification contained
 guidelines and examples that were considered sufficient to enable a person of
 ordinary skill in the art to draw a line between unavoidable impurities in
 starting materials and essential ingredients. *In re**Marosi,* 710 F.2d 799, 218 USPQ 289 (CCPA 1983). The court
 further observed that it would be impractical to require applicants to specify
 a particular number as a cutoff between their invention and the prior art.
 

***C.******"Similar"***The term "similar" in the preamble of a claim that was
 directed to a nozzle "for high-pressure cleaning units or similar apparatus"
 was held to be indefinite since it was not clear what applicant intended to
 cover by the recitation "similar" apparatus. *Ex parte**Kristensen,* 10 USPQ2d 1701 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1989).
 


A claim in a design patent application which read: "The
 ornamental design for a feed bunk or similar structure as shown and described."
 was held to be indefinite because it was unclear from the specification what
 applicant intended to cover by the recitation of "similar structure."
 *Ex parte**Pappas,* 23 USPQ2d 1636 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992).
 

***D.******"Substantially"***The term "substantially" is often used in conjunction with
 another term to describe a particular characteristic of the claimed invention.
 It is a broad term. *In re**Nehrenberg,* 280 F.2d 161, 126 USPQ 383 (CCPA 1960). The
 court held that the limitation "to substantially increase the efficiency of the
 compound as a copper extractant" was definite in view of the general guidelines
 contained in the specification. *In re**Mattison,* 509 F.2d 563, 184 USPQ 484 (CCPA 1975). The court
 held that the limitation "which produces substantially equal E and H plane
 illumination patterns" was definite because one of ordinary skill in the art
 would know what was meant by "substantially equal." *Andrew
 Corp.**v.**Gabriel Electronics,* 847 F.2d 819, 6 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir.
 1988).
 

***E.******"Type"***The addition of the word "type" to an otherwise definite
 expression (e.g., Friedel-Crafts catalyst) extends the scope of the expression
 so as to render it indefinite.  *Ex parte**Copenhaver,* 109 USPQ 118 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1955).
 Likewise, the phrase "ZSM-5-type aluminosilicate zeolites" was held to be
 indefinite because it was unclear what "type" was intended to convey. The
 interpretation was made more difficult by the fact that the zeolites defined in
 the dependent claims were not within the genus of the type of zeolites defined
 in the independent claim. *Ex parte**Attig,* 7 USPQ2d 1092 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986).
 

**IV.** **SUBJECTIVE TERMS**When a subjective term is used in the claim, the
 examiner should determine whether the specification supplies some standard for
 measuring the scope of the term, similar to the analysis for a term of degree.
 Some objective standard must be provided in order to allow the public to determine
 the scope of the claim. A claim that requires the exercise of subjective judgment
 without restriction may render the claim indefinite. *In re
 Musgrave,* 431 F.2d 882, 893, 167 USPQ 280, 289 (CCPA 1970). Claim
 scope cannot depend solely on the unrestrained, subjective opinion of a particular
 individual purported to be practicing the invention. *Datamize LLC v.
 Plumtree Software, Inc.,* 417 F.3d 1342, 1350, 75 USPQ2d 1801, 1807
 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); see also *Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL,
 Inc.,* 766 F.3d 1364, 1373, 112 USPQ2d 1188 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding
 the claim phrase "unobtrusive manner" indefinite because the specification did not
 "provide a reasonably clear and exclusive definition, leaving the facially
 subjective claim language without an objective boundary"). 
 


For example, in *Datamize,* the
 invention was directed to a computer interface screen with an "aesthetically
 pleasing look and feel." *Datamize,* 417 F.3d at 1344-45. The
 meaning of the term "aesthetically pleasing" depended solely on the subjective
 opinion of the person selecting features to be included on the interface screen.
 Nothing in the intrinsic evidence (e.g., the specification) provided any guidance
 as to what design choices would result in an "aesthetically pleasing" look and
 feel. *Id.* at 1352. The claims were held indefinite because the
 interface screen may be "aesthetically pleasing" to one user but not to another.
 *Id.* at 1350. See also *Ex parte Anderson,*
 21 USPQ2d 1241 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991) (the terms "comparable" and
 "superior" were held to be indefinite in the context of a limitation relating the
 characteristics of the claimed material to other materials). 
 


During prosecution, the applicant may overcome a
 rejection by amending the claim to remove the subjective term, or by providing
 evidence that the meaning of the term can be ascertained by one of ordinary skill
 in the art when reading the disclosure. However, "[f]or some facially subjective
 terms, the definiteness requirement is not satisfied by merely offering examples
 that satisfy the term within the specification." *DDR Holdings, LLC v.
 Hotels.com, L.P.,* 773 F.3d 1245, 1261, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1108 (Fed.
 Cir. 2014).
 




# 2173.05(c) Numerical Ranges and Amounts Limitations [R-11.2013]


Generally, the recitation of specific numerical ranges in a claim
 does not raise an issue of whether a claim is definite.
 

**I.** **NARROW AND BROADER RANGES IN THE SAME CLAIM**Use of a narrow numerical range that falls within a broader range
 in the same claim may render the claim indefinite when the boundaries of the claim
 are not discernible. Description of examples and preferences is properly set forth
 in the specification rather than in a single claim. A narrower range or preferred
 embodiment may also be set forth in another independent claim or in a dependent
 claim. If stated in a single claim, examples and preferences lead to confusion
 over the intended scope of the claim. In those instances where it is not clear
 whether the claimed narrower range is a limitation, a rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph should be made. The Examiner should analyze whether the metes and bounds
 of the claim are clearly set forth. Examples of claim language which have been
 held to be indefinite are (A) "a temperature of between 45 and 78 degrees Celsius,
 preferably between 50 and 60 degrees Celsius"; and (B) "a predetermined quantity,
 for example, the maximum capacity."
 


While a single claim that includes both a broad and a narrower
 range may be indefinite, it is not improper under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, to present a dependent claim that sets forth a narrower range for an
 element than the range set forth in the claim from which it depends. For example,
 if claim 1 reads "A circuit … wherein the resistance is 70-150 ohms." and claim 2
 reads "The circuit of claim 1 wherein the resistance is 70-100 ohms.", then claim
 2 should not be rejected as indefinite. 
 

**II.** **OPEN-ENDED NUMERICAL RANGES**Open-ended numerical ranges should be carefully analyzed for
 definiteness. For example, when an independent claim recites a composition
 comprising "at least 20% sodium" and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts
 of nonsodium ingredients which add up to 100%, apparently to the exclusion of
 sodium, an ambiguity is created with regard to the "at least" limitation (unless
 the percentages of the nonsodium ingredients are based on the weight of the
 nonsodium ingredients). On the other hand, the court held that a composition
 claimed to have a theoretical content greater than 100% (i.e., 20-80% of A, 20-80%
 of B  and 1-25% of C) was not indefinite simply because the claims may be read in
 theory to include compositions that are impossible in fact to formulate. It was
 observed that subject matter which cannot exist in fact can neither anticipate nor
 infringe a claim. *In re**Kroekel,* 504 F.2d 1143, 183 USPQ 610 (CCPA 1974).
 


In a claim directed to a chemical reaction process, a limitation
 required that the amount of one ingredient in the reaction mixture should "be
 maintained at less than 7 mole percent" based on the amount of another ingredient.
 The examiner argued that the claim was indefinite because the limitation sets only
 a maximum amount and is inclusive of substantially no ingredient resulting in
 termination of any reaction. The court did not agree, holding that the claim was
 clearly directed to a reaction process, and explaining that "[t]he imposition of a
 maximum limit on the quantity of one of the reactants without specifying a minimum
 does not warrant distorting the overall meaning of the claim to preclude
 performing the claimed process."*In re**Kirsch,* 498 F.2d 1389, 1394, 182 USPQ 286, 290 (CCPA 1974).
 


Some terms have been determined to have the following meanings in
 the factual situations of the reported cases: the term "up to" includes zero as a
 lower limit, *In re**Mochel,* 470 F.2d 638, 176 USPQ 194 (CCPA 1974); and "a moisture
 content of not more than 70% by weight" reads on dry material, *Ex
 parte**Khusid,* 174 USPQ 59 (Bd. App. 1971).
 

**III.** **"EFFECTIVE AMOUNT"**The common phrase "an effective amount" may or may not be
 indefinite. The proper test is whether or not one skilled in the art could
 determine specific values for the amount based on the disclosure. See *In
 re**Mattison,* 509 F.2d 563, 184 USPQ 484 (CCPA 1975). The phrase
 "an effective amount . . . for growth stimulation" was held to be definite where
 the amount was not critical and those skilled in the art would be able to
 determine from the written disclosure, including the examples, what an effective
 amount is. *In re**Halleck,* 422 F.2d 911, 164 USPQ 647 (CCPA 1970). The phrase "an
 effective amount" has been held to be indefinite when the claim fails to state the
 function which is to be achieved and more than one effect can be implied from the
 specification or the relevant art. *In re**Fredericksen,* 213 F.2d 547, 102 USPQ 35 (CCPA 1954). The more
 recent cases have tended to accept a limitation such as "an effective amount" as
 being definite when read in light of the supporting disclosure and in the absence
 of any prior art which would give rise to uncertainty about the scope of the
 claim. In *Ex parte**Skuballa,* 12 USPQ2d 1570 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989), the
 Board held that a pharmaceutical composition claim which recited an "effective
 amount of a compound of claim 1" without stating the function to be achieved was
 definite, particularly when read in light of the supporting disclosure which
 provided guidelines as to the intended utilities and how the uses could be
 effected.
 




# 2173.05(d) Exemplary Claim Language ("for example," "such
 as") [R-07.2015]


Description of examples or preferences is properly set forth in the
 specification rather than the claims. If stated in the claims, examples and
 preferences may lead to confusion over the intended scope of a claim. In those
 instances where it is not clear whether the claimed narrower range is a limitation, a
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph should be made. The examiner
 should analyze whether the metes and bounds of the claim are clearly set forth. Note
 that the mere use of the phrase "such as" or "for example" in a claim does not by
 itself render the claim indefinite.
 


 Examples of claim language which have been held to be
 indefinite because the intended scope of the claim was unclear are: 
 


* (A) "R is halogen, for example, chlorine";
* (B) "material such as rock wool or asbestos" *Ex
 parte**Hall,* 83 USPQ 38 (Bd. App. 1949);
* (C) "lighter hydrocarbons, such, for example, as the vapors or gas
 produced" *Ex parte**Hasche,* 86 USPQ 481 (Bd. App. 1949);
* (D) "normal operating conditions such as while in the container of
 a proportioner" *Ex parte**Steigerwald,* 131 USPQ 74 (Bd. App. 1961); and
* (E) "coke, brick, or like material". *Ex
 parte Caldwell,* 1906 C.D. 58 (Comm’r Pat. 1906).


The above examples of claim language which have been held to be
 indefinite are fact specific and should not be applied as
 *per se* rules. See **[MPEP § 2173.02](s2173.html#d0e217598)** for guidance
 regarding when it is appropriate to make a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 




# 2173.05(e) Lack of Antecedent Basis [R-08.2017]


A claim is indefinite when it contains words or phrases whose
 meaning is unclear. *In re Packard,* 751 F.3d 1307, 1314, 110 USPQ2d
 1785, 1789 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The lack of clarity could arise where a claim refers to
 "said lever" or "the lever," where the claim contains no earlier recitation or
 limitation of a lever and where it would be unclear as to what element the limitation
 was making reference. Similarly, if two different levers are recited earlier in the
 claim, the recitation of "said lever" in the same or subsequent claim would be
 unclear where it is uncertain which of the two levers was intended. A claim which
 refers to "said aluminum lever," but recites only "a lever" earlier in the claim, is
 indefinite because it is uncertain as to the lever to which reference is made.
 Obviously, however, the failure to provide explicit antecedent basis for terms does
 not always render a claim indefinite. If the scope of a claim would be reasonably
 ascertainable by those skilled in the art, then the claim is not indefinite.
 *Ex parte Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144, 1145 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1992) ("controlled stream of fluid" provided reasonable antecedent basis for
 "the controlled fluid"). Inherent components of elements recited have antecedent
 basis in the recitation of the components themselves. For example, the limitation
 "the outer surface of said sphere" would not require an antecedent recitation that
 the sphere has an outer surface. See *Bose Corp. v. JBL, Inc.,* 274
 F.3d 1354, 1359, 61 USPQ2d 1216, 1218-19 (Fed. Cir 2001) (holding that recitation of
 "an ellipse" provided antecedent basis for "an ellipse having a major diameter"
 because "[t]here can be no dispute that mathematically an inherent characteristic of
 an ellipse is a major diameter").
 

**I.** **EXAMINER SHOULD SUGGEST CORRECTIONS TO ANTECEDENT PROBLEMS**Antecedent problems in the claims are typically drafting
 oversights that are easily corrected once they are brought to the attention of
 applicant. The examiner’s task of making sure the claim language complies with the
 requirements of the statute should be carried out in a positive and constructive
 way, so that minor problems can be identified and easily corrected, and so that
 the major effort is expended on more substantive issues. However, even though
 indefiniteness in claim language is of semantic origin, it is not rendered
 unobjectionable simply because it could have been corrected. *In re
 Hammack,* 427 F.2d 1384, 1388 n.5, 166 USPQ 209, 213 n.5 (CCPA
 1970).
 

**II.** **A CLAIM TERM WHICH HAS NO ANTECEDENT BASIS IN THE DISCLOSURE IS NOT
 NECESSARILY INDEFINITE**The mere fact that a term or phrase used in the claim has no
 antecedent basis in the specification disclosure does not mean, necessarily, that
 the term or phrase is indefinite. There is no requirement that the words in the
 claim must match those used in the specification disclosure. Applicants are given
 a great deal of latitude in how they choose to define their invention so long as
 the terms and phrases used define the invention with a reasonable degree of
 clarity and precision. 
 

**III.** **A CLAIM IS NOT *PER SE* INDEFINITE IF THE BODY OF THE
 CLAIM RECITES ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR IN THE PREAMBLE**The mere fact that the body of a claim recites additional
 elements which do not appear in the claim’s preamble does not render the claim
 indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. See *In re
 Larsen,* 10 Fed. App'x 890 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (The preamble of the
 *Larsen* claim recited only a hanger and a loop but the body
 of the claim positively recited a linear member. The examiner rejected the claim
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, because the omission from the claim’s
 preamble of a critical element (i.e., a linear member) renders that claim
 indefinite. The court reversed the examiner’s rejection and stated that the
 totality of all the limitations of the claim and their interaction with each other
 must be considered to ascertain the inventor’s contribution to the art. Upon
 review of the claim in its entirety, the court concluded that the claim at issue
 apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves the
 notice function required by **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, paragraph 2.).
 
 




# 2173.05(f) Reference to Limitations in Another Claim [R-11.2013]


A claim which makes reference to a preceding claim to define a
 limitation is an acceptable claim construction which should not necessarily be
 rejected as improper or confusing under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. For example, claims which read:
 "The product produced by the method of claim 1." or "A method of producing ethanol
 comprising contacting amylose with the culture of claim 1 under the following
 conditions ....." are not indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, merely because of the reference to another claim. See also *Ex
 parte**Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (where
 reference to "the nozzle of claim 7" in a method claim was held to comply with
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph). However, where the format of making
 reference to limitations recited in another claim results in confusion, then a
 rejection would be proper under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. 
 


When examining a dependent claim, the examiner should
 also determine whether the claim complies with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, fourth
 paragraph. See **[MPEP §
 608.01(n)](s608.html#d0e45256)**, subsection II.
 




# 2173.05(g) Functional Limitations [R-08.2017]


A claim term is functional when it recites a feature "by what it
 does rather than by what it is" (e.g., as evidenced by its specific structure or
 specific ingredients). *In re**Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 212, 169 USPQ 226, 229 (CCPA 1971). There
 is nothing inherently wrong with defining some part of an invention in functional
 terms. Functional language does not, in and of itself, render a claim improper.
 *Id.* In fact, **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, expressly authorize a form of
 functional claiming (means- (or step-) plus- function claim limitations discussed in
 **[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)***et seq.*). Functional language may also be employed to limit the
 claims without using the means-plus-function format. See, e.g., *K-2 Corp. v.
 Salomon S.A.,* 191 F.3d 1356, 1363, 52 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir.
 1999). Unlike means-plus-function claim language that applies only to purely
 functional limitations, *Phillips v. AWH Corp.,* 415 F.3d 1303,
 1311, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2005) *(en banc)*
 ("Means-plus-function claiming applies only to purely functional limitations that do
 not provide the structure that performs the recited function."), functional claiming
 often involves the recitation of some structure followed by its function. For
 example, in *In re Schreiber,* the claims were directed to a conical
 spout (the structure) that "allow[ed] several kernels of popped popcorn to pass
 through at the same time" (the function). *In re Schreiber,* 128
 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997). As noted by the court in
 *Schreiber,* "[a] patent applicant is free to recite features of
 an apparatus either structurally or functionally." *Id.*


A functional limitation must be evaluated and considered, just like
 any other limitation of the claim, for what it fairly conveys to a person of ordinary
 skill in the pertinent art in the context in which it is used. A functional
 limitation is often used in association with an element, ingredient, or step of a
 process to define a particular capability or purpose that is served by the recited
 element, ingredient or step. In *Innova/Pure Water Inc. v. Safari Water
 Filtration Sys. Inc.,* 381 F.3d 1111, 1117-20, 72 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-08
 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court noted that the claim term "operatively connected" is "a
 general descriptive claim term frequently used in patent drafting to reflect a
 functional relationship between claimed components," that is, the term "means the
 claimed components must be connected in a way to perform a designated function." "In
 the absence of modifiers, general descriptive terms are typically construed as having
 their full meaning." *Id.* at 1118, 72 USPQ2d at 1006. In the patent
 claim at issue, "subject to any clear and unmistakable disavowal of claim scope, the
 term ‘operatively connected’ takes the full breath of its ordinary meaning, i.e.,
 ‘said tube [is] operatively connected to said cap’ when the tube and cap are arranged
 in a manner capable of performing the function of filtering." *Id.*
 at 1120, 72 USPQ2d at 1008.
 


Other examples of permissible function language include the
 following. 
 



It was held that the limitation used to define a
 radical on a chemical compound as "incapable of forming a dye with said oxidizing
 developing agent" although functional, was perfectly acceptable because it set
 definite boundaries on the patent protection sought. *In re
 Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971). 
 




In a claim that was directed to a kit of component
 parts capable of being assembled, the court held that limitations such as "members
 adapted to be positioned" and "portions . . . being resiliently dilatable whereby
 said housing may be slidably positioned" serve to precisely define present
 structural attributes of interrelated component parts of the claimed assembly.
 *In re Venezia,* 530 F.2d 956, 189 USPQ 149 (CCPA 1976).
 



Notwithstanding the permissible instances, the use of
 functional language in a claim may fail "to provide a clear-cut indication of the
 scope of the subject matter embraced by the claim" and thus be indefinite.
 *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 213 (CCPA 1971). For example,
 when claims merely recite a description of a problem to be solved or a function or
 result achieved by the invention, the boundaries of the claim scope may be unclear.
 *Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v. M-I LLC,* 514 F.3d 1244,
 1255, 85 USPQ2d 1654, 1663 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that the Supreme Court explained
 that a vice of functional claiming occurs "when the inventor is painstaking when he
 recites what has already been seen, and then uses conveniently functional language at
 the exact point of novelty") (quoting *General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance
 Corp.,* 304 U.S. 364, 371 (1938)); see also *United Carbon Co. v.
 Binney & Smith Co.,* 317 U.S. 228, 234 (1942) (holding indefinite
 claims that recited substantially pure carbon black "in the form of commercially
 uniform, comparatively small, rounded smooth aggregates having a spongy or porous
 exterior"). Further, without reciting the particular structure, materials or steps
 that accomplish the function or achieve the result, all means or methods of resolving
 the problem may be encompassed by the claim. *Ariad Pharmaceuticals., Inc. v.
 Eli Lilly & Co.,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1353, 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1173 (Fed.
 Cir. 2010) *(en banc)*. See also *Datamize LLC v. Plumtree
 Software Inc.,* 75 USPQ2d 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2005) where a claim directed to
 a software based system for creating a customized computer interface screen recited
 that the screen be "aesthetically pleasing," which is an intended result and does not
 provide a clear cut indication of scope because it imposed no structural limits on
 the screen. Unlimited functional claim limitations that extend to all means or
 methods of resolving a problem may not be adequately supported by the written
 description or may not be commensurate in scope with the enabling disclosure, both of
 which are required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. *In re Hyatt,*
 708 F.2d 712, 714, 218 USPQ 195, 197 (Fed. Cir. 1983); *Ariad,* 598
 F.3d at 1340, 94 USPQ2d at 1167. For instance, a single means claim covering every
 conceivable means for achieving the stated result was held to be invalid under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph because the court recognized that the
 specification, which disclosed only those means known to the inventor, was not
 commensurate in scope with the claim. *Hyatt,* 708 F.2d at 714-715,
 218 USPQ at 197. For more information regarding the written description requirement
 and enablement requirement under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, see **[MPEP §§
 2161](s2161.html#d0e213359)**-**[2164.08(c)](s2164.html#d0e216899)**. Examiners should keep in
 mind that whether or not the functional limitation complies with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is a different issue from whether the limitation is properly supported
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, or is distinguished over the prior art. 
 


When a claim limitation employs functional language,
 the examiner’s determination of whether the limitation is sufficiently definite will
 be highly dependent on context (e.g., the disclosure in the specification and the
 knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art). *Halliburton Energy
 Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255, 85 USPQ2d at 1663. For example, a claim that
 included the term "fragile gel" was found to be indefinite because the definition of
 the term in the specification was functional, i.e., the fluid is defined by what it
 does rather than what it is ("ability of the fluid to transition quickly from gel to
 liquid, and the ability of the fluid to suspend drill cuttings at rest"), and it was
 ambiguous as to the requisite degree of the fragileness of the gel, the ability of
 the gel to suspend drill cuttings (i.e., gel strength), and/or some combination of
 the two. *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255-56, 85 USPQ2d
 at 1663. In another example, the claims directed to a tungsten filament for electric
 incandescent lamps were held invalid for including a limitation that recited
 "comparatively large grains of such size and contour as to prevent substantial
 sagging or offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for such a lamp or
 other device." *General Elec. Co.,* 304 U.S. at 370-71, 375. The
 Court observed that the prior art filaments also "consisted of comparatively large
 crystals" but they were "subject to offsetting" or shifting, and the Court further
 found that the phrase "of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and
 offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for a lamp or other device"
 did not adequately define the structural characteristics of the grains (e.g., the
 size and contour) to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art.
 *Id.* at 370. Similarly, a claim was held invalid because it
 recited "sustantially (sic) pure carbon black in the form of commercially uniform,
 comparatively small, rounded smooth aggregates having a spongy or porous exterior."
 *United Carbon Co.,* 317 U.S. at 234. In the latter example, the
 Court observed various problems with the limitation: "commercially uniform" meant
 only the degree of uniformity buyers desired; "comparatively small" did not add
 anything because no standard for comparison was given; and "spongy" and "porous" are
 synonyms that the Court found unhelpful in distinguishing the claimed invention from
 the prior art. *Id.* at 233. 
 


In comparison, a claim limitation reciting
 "transparent to infrared rays" was held to be definite because the specification
 showed that a substantial amount of infrared radiation was always transmitted even
 though the degree of transparency varied depending on certain factors.
 *Swinehart,* 439 F.2d at 214, 169 USPQ at 230. Likewise, the
 claims in another case were held definite because applicant provided "a general
 guideline and examples sufficient to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to
 determine whether a process uses a silicon dioxide source ‘essentially free of alkali
 metal’ to make a reaction mixture ‘essentially free of alkali metal’ to produce a
 zeolitic compound ‘essentially free of alkali metal.’" *In re
 Marosi,* 710 F.2d 799, 803, 218 USPQ 289, 293 (Fed. Cir. 1983). 
 


Examiners should consider the following factors when
 examining claims that contain functional language to determine whether the language
 is ambiguous: (1) whether there is a clear cut indication of the scope of the subject
 matter covered by the claim; (2) whether the language sets forth well-defined
 boundaries of the invention or only states a problem solved or a result obtained; and
 (3) whether one of ordinary skill in the art would know from the claim terms what
 structure or steps are encompassed by the claim. These factors are examples of points
 to be considered when determining whether language is ambiguous and are not intended
 to be all inclusive or limiting. Other factors may be more relevant for particular
 arts. The primary inquiry is whether the language leaves room for ambiguity or
 whether the boundaries are clear and precise. 
 


During prosecution, applicant may resolve the
 ambiguities of a functional limitation in a number of ways. For example: (1) "the
 ambiguity might be resolved by using a quantitative metric (e.g., numeric limitation
 as to a physical property) rather than a qualitative functional feature" (see
 *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255-56, 85 USPQ2d at
 1663); (2) applicant could demonstrate that the "specification provide[s] a formula
 for calculating a property along with examples that meet the claim limitation and
 examples that do not" (see *id.* at 1256, 85 USPQ2d at 1663 (citing
 *Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int’l,* 316 F.3d 1331, 1341, 65
 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003))); (3) applicant could demonstrate that the
 specification provides a general guideline and examples sufficient to teach a person
 skilled in the art when the claim limitation was satisfied (see
 *Marosi,* 710 F.2d at 803, 218 USPQ at 292); or (4) applicant
 could amend the claims to recite the particular structure that accomplishes the
 function. 
 




# 2173.05(h) Alternative Limitations [R-10.2019]

**I.** **MARKUSH GROUPS**A claim which recites a list of alternatives to

 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)** for guidelines regarding the determination of
 whether a Markush grouping is improper.
 


Treatment of claims reciting alternatives is not governed by the
 particular format used (e.g., alternatives may be set forth as "a material
 selected from the group consisting of A, B, and C" or "wherein the material is A,
 B, or C"). See, e.g., the *Supplementary Examination Guidelines for
 Determining Compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112 and for Treatment of Related Issues
 in Patent Applications* ("Supplementary Guidelines"), 76 Fed. Reg.
 7162, 7166 (February 9, 2011). Claims that set forth a list of alternatives from
 which a selection is to be made are typically referred to as Markush claims, after
 the appellant in *Ex parte Markush,* 1925 Dec. Comm’r Pat. 126,
 127 (1924). The listing of specified alternatives within a Markush claim is
 referred to as a Markush group or Markush grouping. *Abbott Labs v. Baxter
 Pharmaceutical Products, Inc.,* 334 F.3d 1274, 1280-81, 67 USPQ2d
 1191, 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing to several sources that describe Markush
 groups).
 


See **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)** for a general discussion of Markush claims and
 guidelines regarding the determination of whether a Markush grouping is improper,
 and **[MPEP §
 803.02](s803.html#d0e98237)** for a discussion of election requirements in
 Markush claims.
 


A Markush grouping is a closed group of
 alternatives, i.e., the selection is made from a group "consisting of" (rather
 than "comprising" or "including") the alternative members. *Abbott
 Labs.,* 334 F.3d at 1280, 67 USPQ2d at 1196. If a Markush grouping
 requires a material selected from an open list of alternatives (e.g., selected
 from the group "comprising" or "consisting essentially of" the recited
 alternatives), the claim should generally be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** as indefinite because it is unclear what other
 alternatives are intended to be encompassed by the claim. If a claim is intended
 to encompass combinations or mixtures of the alternatives set forth in the Markush
 grouping, the claim may include qualifying language preceding the recited
 alternatives (such as "at least one member" selected from the group), or within
 the list of alternatives (such as "or mixtures thereof"). *Id.*
 at 1281. See also **[MPEP § 2111.03](s2111.html#d0e200824)**. 
 


A Markush grouping may include a large number of
 alternatives, and as a result a Markush claim may encompass a large number of
 alternative members or embodiments, but a claim is not necessarily indefinite
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** for such breadth. *In re
 Gardner,* 427 F.2d 786, 788, 166 USPQ 138, 140 (CCPA 1970) ("Breadth
 is not indefiniteness."). In certain circumstances, however, a Markush group may
 be so expansive that persons skilled in the art cannot determine the metes and
 bounds of the claimed invention. For example, if a claim defines a chemical
 compound using one or more Markush groups, and that claim encompasses a massive
 number of distinct alternative members, the claim may be indefinite under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** if one skilled in the art cannot determine its
 metes and bounds due to an inability to envision all of the compounds defined by
 the Markush group(s). In such a circumstance, a rejection of the claim for
 indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** is
 appropriate.
 


The use of Markush claims of diminishing scope should not, in
 itself, be considered a sufficient basis for objection to or rejection of claims.
 However, if such a practice renders the claims indefinite or if it results in
 undue multiplicity, an appropriate rejection should be made. 
 


Similarly, the double inclusion of an element by members of a
 Markush group is not, in itself, sufficient basis for objection to or rejection of
 claims. Rather, the facts in each case must be evaluated to determine whether or
 not the multiple inclusion of one or more elements in a claim renders that claim
 indefinite. The mere fact that a compound may be embraced by more than one member
 of a Markush group recited in the claim does not necessarily render the scope of
 the claim unclear. For example, the Markush group, "selected from the group
 consisting of amino, halogen, nitro, chloro and alkyl" should be acceptable even
 though "halogen" is generic to "chloro." See, e.g., *Eli Lilly & Co.
 v. Teva Parenteral Meds.,* 845 F.3d 1357, 1371,121 USPQ2d 1277, 1287
 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (redundancy of including both "vitamin B12" and "cyanocobalamin"
 (which were recognized on the record as referencing the same compound) within a
 Markush group of methylmalonic acid lowering agents did not render the claims
 indefinite).
 

**II.** **"OPTIONALLY"**Another alternative format which requires some analysis before
 concluding whether or not the language is indefinite involves the use of the term
 "optionally." In *Ex parte**Cordova,* 10 USPQ2d 1949 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989) the
 language "containing A, B, and optionally C" was considered acceptable alternative
 language because there was no ambiguity as to which alternatives are covered by
 the claim. A similar holding was reached with regard to the term "optionally" in
 *Ex parte**Wu,* 10 USPQ2d 2031 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). In the
 instance where the list of potential alternatives can vary and ambiguity arises,
 then it is proper to make a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** and explain why there is confusion.
 




# 2173.05(i) Negative Limitations [R-08.2017]


The current view of the courts is that there is nothing inherently
 ambiguous or uncertain about a negative limitation. So long as the boundaries of the
 patent protection sought are set forth definitely, albeit negatively, the claim
 complies with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. Some older cases were critical
 of negative limitations because they tended to define the invention in terms of what
 it was not, rather than pointing out the invention. Thus, the court observed that the
 limitation "R is an alkenyl radical other than 2-butenyl and 2,4-pentadienyl" was a
 negative limitation that rendered the claim indefinite because it was an attempt to
 claim the invention by excluding what the inventors did not invent rather than
 distinctly and particularly pointing out what they did invent. *In re
 Schechter,* 205 F.2d 185, 98 USPQ 144 (CCPA 1953).
 


A claim which recited the limitation "said homopolymer being free
 from the proteins, soaps, resins, and sugars present in natural Hevea rubber" in
 order to exclude the characteristics of the prior art product, was considered
 definite because each recited limitation was definite. *In re
 Wakefield,* 422 F.2d 897, 899, 904, 164 USPQ 636, 638, 641 (CCPA 1970).
 In addition, the court found that the negative limitation "incapable of forming a dye
 with said oxidized developing agent" was definite because the boundaries of the
 patent protection sought were clear. *In re Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170
 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971).
 


Any negative limitation or exclusionary proviso must have basis in
 the original disclosure. If alternative elements are positively recited in the
 specification, they may be explicitly excluded in the claims. See *In re
 Johnson,* 558 F.2d 1008, 1019, 194 USPQ 187, 196 (CCPA 1977) ("[the]
 specification, having described the whole, necessarily described the part
 remaining."). See also *Ex parte Grasselli,* 231 USPQ 393 (Bd. App.
 1983), *aff’d mem.,* 738 F.2d 453 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In describing
 alternative features, the applicant need not articulate advantages or disadvantages
 of each feature in order to later exclude the alternative features. See
 *Inphi Corporation v. Netlist, Inc.,* 805 F.3d 1350, 1356-57, 116
 USPQ2d 2006, 2010-11 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The mere absence of a positive recitation is
 not basis for an exclusion. Any claim containing a negative limitation which does not
 have basis in the original disclosure should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, as failing to comply with the written description requirement. Note that a
 lack of literal basis in the specification for a negative limitation may not be
 sufficient to establish a *prima facie* case for lack of descriptive
 support. *Ex parte Parks,* 30 USPQ2d 1234, 1236 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1993). See **[MPEP
 § 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** - **[§ 2163.07(b)](s2163.html#d0e215198)** for a discussion of the
 written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph.
 




# 2173.05(j) Old Combination [R-11.2013]

**A CLAIM SHOULD NOT BE REJECTED ON THE GROUND OF OLD COMBINATION**With the passage of the 1952 Patent Act, the courts and the Board
 have taken the view that a rejection based on the principle of old combination is
 NO LONGER VALID. Claims should be considered proper so long as they comply with
 the provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. 
 


A rejection on the basis of old combination was based on the
 principle applied in *Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner
 Corp.,* 303 U.S. 545, 37 USPQ 1 (1938). The principle was that an
 inventor who made an improvement or contribution to but one element of a generally
 old combination, should not be able to obtain a patent on the entire combination
 including the new and improved element. A rejection required the citation of a
 single reference which broadly disclosed a combination of the claimed elements
 functionally cooperating in substantially the same manner to produce substantially
 the same results as that of the claimed combination. The case of *In re
 Hall,* 208 F.2d 370, 100 USPQ 46 (CCPA 1953) illustrates an
 application of this principle.
 


The court pointed out in *In re Bernhart,* 417
 F.2d 1395, 163 USPQ 611 (CCPA 1969) that the statutory language (particularly
 point out and distinctly claim) is the only proper basis for an old combination
 rejection, and in applying the rejection, that language determines what an
 applicant has a right and obligation to do. A majority opinion of the Board of
 Appeals held that Congress removed the underlying rationale of *Lincoln
 Engineering* in the 1952 Patent Act, and thereby effectively
 legislated that decision out of existence. *Ex parte Barber,* 187
 USPQ 244 (Bd. App. 1974). Finally, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
 in *Radio Steel and Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc.,* 731 F.2d
 840, 221 USPQ 657 (Fed. Cir. 1984), followed the **Bernhart** case, and ruled that a claim was not invalid under *Lincoln
 Engineering* because the claim complied with the requirements of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. Accordingly, a claim should not be
 rejected on the ground of old combination.
 




# 2173.05(k) Aggregation [R-08.2012]


A claim should not be rejected on the ground of "aggregation."
 *In re Gustafson,* 331 F.2d 905, 141 USPQ 585 (CCPA 1964) (an
 applicant is entitled to know whether the claims are being rejected under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, **[102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, or
 **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**); *In re Collier,* 397 F.2d 1003, 1006,
 158 USPQ 266, 268 (CCPA 1968) ("[A] rejection for ‘aggregation’ is
 non-statutory.").
 


If a claim omits essential matter or fails to interrelate essential
 elements of the invention as defined by applicant(s) in the specification, see
 **[MPEP
 § 2172.01](s2172.html#d0e217526)**.
 





# 2173.05(l) [Reserved]





# 2173.05(m) Prolix [R-08.2012]


Examiners should reject claims as prolix only when they contain such
 long recitations or unimportant details that the scope of the claimed invention is
 rendered indefinite thereby. Claims are rejected as prolix when they contain long
 recitations that the metes and bounds of the claimed subject matter cannot be
 determined.
 




# 2173.05(n) Multiplicity [R-11.2013]



#### *37 CFR 1.75  Claim(s).*


* (a) The specification must conclude with a claim particularly
 pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant
 regards as his invention or discovery.
* (b) More than one claim may be presented provided they differ
 substantially from each other and are not unduly multiplied.


\*\*\*\*\*



Where, in view of the nature and scope of applicant’s invention,
 applicant presents an unreasonable number of claims which are repetitious and
 multiplied, the net result of which is to confuse rather than to clarify, a rejection
 on undue multiplicity based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, may be appropriate. As noted by
 the court in *In re Chandler,* 319 F.2d 211, 225, 138 USPQ 138, 148
 (CCPA 1963), "applicants should be allowed reasonable latitude in stating their
 claims in regard to number and phraseology employed. The right of applicants to
 freedom of choice in selecting phraseology which truly points out and defines their
 inventions should not be abridged. Such latitude, however, should not be extended to
 sanction that degree of repetition and multiplicity which beclouds definition in a
 maze of confusion. The rule of reason should be practiced and applied on the basis of
 the relevant facts and circumstances in each individual case." See also *In
 re Flint,* 411 F.2d 1353, 1357, 162 USPQ 228, 231 (CCPA 1969). Undue
 multiplicity rejections based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be applied judiciously and
 should be rare. 
 


If an undue multiplicity rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is appropriate, the examiner should contact applicant by telephone
 explaining that the claims are unduly multiplied and will be rejected under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. Note **[MPEP §
 408](s408.html#d0e22768)**. The examiner should also request that applicant select
 a specified number of claims for purpose of examination. If applicant is willing to
 select, by telephone, the claims for examination, an undue multiplicity rejection on
 all the claims based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be made in the next Office
 action along with an action on the merits on the selected claims. If applicant
 refuses to comply with the telephone request, an undue multiplicity rejection of all
 the claims based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be made in the next Office
 action. Applicant’s reply must include a selection of claims for purpose of
 examination, the number of which may not be greater than the number specified by the
 examiner. In response to applicant’s reply, if the examiner adheres to the undue
 multiplicity rejection, it should be repeated and the selected claims will be
 examined on the merits. This procedure preserves applicant’s right to have the
 rejection on undue multiplicity reviewed by the Patent Trail and Appeal Board. 
 


Also, it is possible to reject one claim over an allowed claim if
 they differ only by subject matter old in the art. This ground of rejection is set
 forth in *Ex parte**Whitelaw,* 1915 C.D. 18, 219 O.G. 1237 (Comm’r Pat. 1914). The
 *Ex parte**Whitelaw* doctrine is restricted to cases where the claims are
 unduly multiplied or are substantial duplicates. *Ex parte Kochan,*
 131 USPQ 204, 206 (Bd. App. 1961).
 




# 2173.05(o) Double Inclusion [R-08.2012]


There is no *per se* rule that "double inclusion"
 is improper in a claim. *In re Kelly,* 305 F.2d 909, 916, 134 USPQ
 397, 402 (CCPA 1962) ("Automatic reliance upon a ‘rule against double inclusion’ will
 lead to as many unreasonable interpretations as will automatic reliance upon a ‘rule
 allowing double inclusion’. The governing consideration is not *double
 inclusion,* but rather is what is a reasonable construction of the
 language of the claims."). Older cases, such as *Ex parte White,*
 127 USPQ 261 (Bd. App. 1958) and *Ex parte Clark,* 174 USPQ 40 (Bd.
 App. 1971) should be applied with care, according to the facts of each case.
 


The facts in each case must be evaluated to determine whether or not
 the multiple inclusion of one or more elements in a claim gives rise to
 indefiniteness in that claim. The mere fact that a compound may be embraced by more
 than one member of a Markush group recited in the claim does not lead to any
 uncertainty as to the scope of that claim for either examination or infringement
 purposes. On the other hand, where a claim directed to a device can be read to
 include the same element twice, the claim may be indefinite. *Ex parte
 Kristensen,* 10 USPQ2d 1701 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).
 




# 2173.05(p) Claim Directed to Product-By- Process or Product and
 Process [R-10.2019]


There are many situations where claims are permissively drafted to
 include a reference to more than one statutory class of invention. 
 

**I.** **PRODUCT-BY-PROCESS**A product-by-process claim, which is a product claim that defines
 the claimed product in terms of the process by which it is made, is
 proper.*Purdue Pharma v. Epic Pharma,* 811 F.3d 1345, 1354,
 117 USPQ2d 1733, 1739 (Fed. Cir. 2016); *In re Luck,* 476 F.2d
 650, 177 USPQ 523 (CCPA 1973); *In re Pilkington,* 411 F.2d 1345,
 162 USPQ 145 (CCPA 1969); and *In re Steppan,* 394 F.2d 1013, 156
 USPQ 143 (CCPA 1967). A claim to a device, apparatus, manufacture, or composition
 of matter may contain a reference to the process in which it is intended to be
 used without being objectionable under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, so long as it is clear that the claim is directed to the product and
 not the process.
 


An applicant may present claims of varying scope even if it is
 necessary to describe the claimed product in product-by-process terms. *Ex
 parte**Pantzer,* 176 USPQ 141 (Bd. App. 1972).
 

**II.** **PRODUCT AND PROCESS IN THE SAME CLAIM**A single claim which claims both an apparatus and the method
 steps of using the apparatus is indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. See *In re Katz Interactive Call Processing Patent
 Litigation,* 639 F.3d 1303, 1318, 97 USPQ2d 1737, 1748-49 (Fed. Cir.
 2011). In *Katz,* a claim directed to "[a] system with an
 interface means for providing automated voice messages…to certain of said
 individual callers, *wherein said certain of said individual callers
 digitally enter data*" was determined to be indefinite because the
 italicized claim limitation is not directed to the system, but rather to actions
 of the individual callers, which creates confusion as to when direct infringement
 occurs. *Katz,* 639 F.3d at 1318 (citing *IPXL Holdings
 v. Amazon.com, Inc.,* 430 F.3d 1377, 1384, 77 USPQ2d 1140, 1145 (Fed.
 Cir. 2005), in which a system claim that recited "an input means" and required a
 user to use the input means was found to be indefinite because it was unclear
 "whether infringement … occurs when one creates a system that allows the user [to
 use the input means], or whether infringement occurs when the user actually uses
 the input means."); *Ex parte**Lyell,* 17 USPQ2d 1548 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990) (claim
 directed to an automatic transmission workstand and the method of using it held
 ambiguous and properly rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph).
 


In contrast, when a claim recites a product and
 additional limitations which focus on the capabilities of the system, not the
 specific actions or functions performed by the user, the claim may be definite
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. See *Mastermine Software, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,*
 874 F.3d 1307, 124 USPQ2d 1618 (Fed. Cir. 2017). 
 




# 2173.05(q) "Use" Claims [R-10.2019]


Attempts to claim a process without setting forth any steps involved
 in the process generally raises an issue of indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. For example, a claim which read: "[a] process for using monoclonal
 antibodies of claim 4 to isolate and purify human fibroblast interferon" was held to
 be indefinite because it merely recites a use without any active, positive steps
 delimiting how this use is actually practiced. *Ex parte**Erlich,* 3 USPQ2d 1011 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986). 
 


"Use" claims that do not purport to claim a process, machine,
 manufacture, or composition of matter fail to comply with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 *In re Moreton,* 288 F.2d 708, 709, 129 USPQ 227, 228 (CCPA
 1961)("one cannot claim a new use per se, because it is not among the categories of
 patentable inventions specified in **[35 U.S.C. § 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**"). In *Ex
 parte**Dunki,* 153 USPQ 678 (Bd. App. 1967), the Board held the following
 claim to be an improper definition of a process: "The use of a high carbon austenitic
 iron alloy having a proportion of free carbon as a vehicle brake part subject to
 stress by sliding friction." In *Clinical Products Ltd. v. Brenner,*
 255 F. Supp. 131, 149 USPQ 475 (D.D.C. 1966), the district court held the following
 claim was definite, but that it was not a proper process claim under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**: "The use of a sustained release therapeutic agent in the
 body of ephedrine absorbed upon polystyrene sulfonic acid." 
 


Although a claim should be interpreted in light of the specification
 disclosure, it is generally considered improper to read limitations contained in the
 specification into the claims. See *In re**Prater,* 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (CCPA 1969) and *In re
 Winkhaus,* 527 F.2d 637, 188 USPQ 129 (CCPA 1975), which discuss the
 premise that one cannot rely on the specification to impart limitations to the claim
 that are not recited in the claim. 
 

**I.** **A "USE" CLAIM MAY BE REJECTED UNDER 35 U.S.C 101 AND/OR 112**It is appropriate to reject a claim that recites a use but fails
 to recite steps under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** if the facts support both rejections. For
 failure to recite a claim within one of the statutory classes under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, the appropriate form paragraph is
 **[7.05.01](#fp7.05.01)**. For indefiniteness under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**, the appropriate form paragraph is
 **[7.34.01](#fp7.34.01)**.
 

**II.** **BOARD HELD STEP OF "UTILIZING" WAS NOT INDEFINITE**It is often difficult to draw a fine line between what is
 permissible, and what is objectionable from the perspective of whether a claim is
 definite. In the case of *Ex parte**Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992), the
 Board held that a claim which clearly recited the step of "utilizing" was not
 indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. (Claim was to "A method
 for unloading nonpacked, nonbridging and packed, bridging flowable particle
 catalyst and bead material from the opened end of a reactor tube which comprises
 utilizing the nozzle of claim 7.").
 




# 2173.05(r) Omnibus Claim [R-10.2019]


Some applications are filed with an omnibus claim which reads as
 follows: A device substantially as shown and described. This claim should be rejected
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, because it is indefinite in that it fails to point out what is included or
 excluded by the claim language. See *Ex parte**Fressola,* 27 USPQ2d 1608 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993), for a
 discussion of the history of omnibus claims and an explanation of why omnibus claims
 do not comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph.
 


Such a claim can be rejected using form paragraph
 **[7.35](#fp7.35)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2175](s2175.html#ch2100_d2c184_13a97_15)**. 
 




# 2173.05(s) Reference to Figures or Tables [R-10.2019]


Where possible, claims are to be complete in themselves.
 Incorporation by reference to a specific figure or table "is permitted only in
 exceptional circumstances where there is no practical way to define the invention in
 words and where it is more concise to incorporate by reference than duplicating a
 drawing or table into the claim. Incorporation by reference is a necessity doctrine,
 not for applicant’s convenience." *Ex parte**Fressola,* 27 USPQ2d 1608, 1609 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993)
 (citations omitted). 
 


Reference characters corresponding to elements recited in the
 detailed description and the drawings may be used in conjunction with the recitation
 of the same element or group of elements in the claims. Generally, the presence or
 absence of such reference characters does not affect the scope of a claim. See
 **[MPEP §
 608.01(m)](s608.html#d0e45061)** for information pertaining to the treatment of
 reference characters in a claim.
 




# 2173.05(t) Chemical Formula [R-11.2013]


Claims to chemical compounds and compositions containing chemical
 compounds often use formulas that depict the chemical structure of the compound.
 These structures should not be considered indefinite nor speculative in the absence
 of evidence that the assigned formula is in error. The absence of corroborating
 spectroscopic or other data cannot be the basis for finding the structure indefinite.
 See *Ex parte**Morton,* 134 USPQ 407 (Bd. App. 1961), and *Ex
 parte**Sobin,* 139 USPQ 528 (Bd. App. 1962). 
 


A claim to a chemical compound is not indefinite merely because a
 structure is not presented or because a partial structure is presented. For example,
 the claim language at issue in *In re**Fisher,* 427 F.2d 833, 166 USPQ 18 (CCPA 1970) referred to a
 chemical compound as a "polypeptide of at least 24 amino acids having the following
 sequence." A rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, for failure to identify the entire structure was reversed and the court
 held: "While the absence of such a limitation obviously broadens the claim and raises
 questions of sufficiency of disclosure, it does not render the claim indefinite."
 Chemical compounds may be claimed by a name that adequately describes the material to
 one skilled in the art. See *Martin**v.**Johnson,* 454 F.2d 746, 172 USPQ 391 (CCPA 1972). A compound of
 unknown structure may be claimed by a combination of physical and chemical
 characteristics. See *Ex parte**Brian,* 118 USPQ 242 (Bd. App. 1958). A compound may also be
 claimed in terms of the process by which it is made without raising an issue of
 indefiniteness. 
 




# 2173.05(u) Trademarks or Trade Names in a Claim [R-11.2013]


The presence of a trademark or trade name in a claim is not,
 *per se,* improper under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, but the claim should be carefully analyzed to determine how the mark or
 name is used in the claim. It is important to recognize that a trademark or trade
 name is used to identify a source of goods, and not the goods themselves. Thus a
 trademark or trade name does not identify or describe the goods associated with the
 trademark or trade name. See definitions of trademark and trade name in
 **[MPEP §
 608.01(v)](s608.html#d0e47416)**. 
 


If the trademark or trade name is used in a claim as a limitation to
 identify or describe a particular material or product, the claim does not comply with
 the requirements of the **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. *Ex parte**Simpson,* 218 USPQ 1020 (Bd. App. 1982). The claim scope is
 uncertain since the trademark or trade name cannot be used properly to identify any
 particular material or product. In fact, the value of a trademark would be lost to
 the extent that it became descriptive of a product, rather than used as an
 identification of a source or origin of a product. Thus, the use of a trademark or
 trade name in a claim to identify or describe a material or product would not only
 render a claim indefinite, but would also constitute an improper use of the trademark
 or trade name.
 


If a trademark or trade name appears in a claim and is not intended
 as a limitation in the claim, the question of why it is in the claim should be
 addressed. If its presence in the claim causes confusion as to the scope of the
 claim, then the claim should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 




# 2173.05(v) Mere Function of Machine [R-11.2013]


Process or method claims are not subject to rejection by U.S. Patent
 and Trademark Office examiners under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, solely on the ground that they
 define the inherent function of a disclosed machine or apparatus. *In
 re**Tarczy-Hornoch,* 397 F.2d 856, 158 USPQ 141 (CCPA 1968). The court
 in *Tarczy-Hornoch* held that a process claim, otherwise patentable,
 should not be rejected merely because the application of which it is a part discloses
 an apparatus which will inherently carry out the recited steps.

# 2173.05(a) New Terminology [R-07.2015]

**I.** **THE MEANING OF EVERY TERM SHOULD BE APPARENT**The meaning of every term used in a claim should be apparent from
 the prior art or from the specification and drawings at the time the application
 is filed. Claim language may not be "ambiguous, vague, incoherent, opaque, or
 otherwise unclear in describing and defining the claimed invention."
 *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1311. Applicants need not confine
 themselves to the terminology used in the prior art, but are required to make
 clear and precise the terms that are used to define the invention whereby the
 metes and bounds of the claimed invention can be ascertained. During patent
 examination, the pending claims must be given the broadest reasonable
 interpretation consistent with the specification. *In re Morris,*
 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *In re
 Prater,* 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (CCPA 1969). See also
 **[MPEP §
 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** - **[§ 2111.01](s2111.html#d0e200409)**. When the specification
 states the meaning that a term in the claim is intended to have, the claim is
 examined using that meaning, in order to achieve a complete exploration of the
 applicant’s invention and its relation to the prior art. *In re
 Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 13 USPQ2d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 

**II.** **THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AND PRECISION MUST BE BALANCED WITH THE
 LIMITATIONS OF THE LANGUAGE**Courts have recognized that it is not only permissible, but often
 desirable, to use new terms that are frequently more precise in describing and
 defining the new invention. *In re**Fisher,* 427 F.2d 833, 166 USPQ 18 (CCPA 1970). Although it is
 difficult to compare the claimed invention with the prior art when new terms are
 used that do not appear in the prior art, this does not make the new terms
 indefinite. 
 


New terms are often used when a new technology is in its infancy
 or is rapidly evolving. The requirements for clarity and precision must be
 balanced with the limitations of the language and the science. If the claims, read
 in light of the specification, reasonably apprise those skilled in the art both of
 the utilization and scope of the invention, and if the language is as precise as
 the subject matter permits, the statute (**[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph) demands no more. *Packard,* 751 F.3d at 1313 ("[H]ow
 much clarity is required necessarily invokes some standard of reasonable precision
 in the use of language in the context of the circumstances."). This does not mean
 that the examiner must accept the best effort of applicant. If the language is not
 considered as precise as the subject matter permits, the examiner should provide
 reasons to support the conclusion of indefiniteness and is encouraged to suggest
 alternatives that would not be subject to rejection.
 

**III.** **TERMS USED CONTRARY TO THEIR ORDINARY MEANING MUST BE CLEARLY REDEFINED IN
 THE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION**Consistent with the well-established axiom in patent law that a
 patentee or applicant is free to be his or her own lexicographer, a patentee or
 applicant may use terms in a manner contrary to or inconsistent with one or more
 of their ordinary meanings if the written description clearly redefines the terms.
 See, e.g., *Process Control Corp. v. HydReclaim Corp.,* 190 F.3d
 1350, 1357, 52 USPQ2d 1029, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("While we have held many times
 that a patentee can act as his own lexicographer to specifically define terms of a
 claim contrary to their ordinary meaning," in such a situation the written
 description must clearly redefine a claim term "so as to put a reasonable
 competitor or one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the patentee
 intended to so redefine that claim term."); *Hormone Research Foundation
 Inc.**v.**Genentech Inc.,* 904 F.2d 1558, 15 USPQ2d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
 Accordingly, when there is more than one meaning for a term, it is incumbent upon
 applicant to make clear which meaning is being relied upon to claim the invention.
 Until the meaning of a term or phrase used in a claim is clear, a rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is appropriate. It is appropriate to compare the meaning of terms given
 in technical dictionaries in order to ascertain the accepted meaning of a term in
 the art. *In re Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971).
 See also **[MPEP
 § 2111.01](s2111.html#d0e200409)**.

# 2173.05(b) Relative Terminology [R-08.2017]


The use of relative terminology in claim language, including terms
 of degree, does not automatically render the claim indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. *Seattle Box Co., Inc. v. Industrial Crating & Packing,
 Inc.,* 731 F.2d 818, 221 USPQ 568 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Acceptability of the
 claim language depends on whether one of ordinary skill in the art would understand
 what is claimed, in light of the specification.
 

**I.** **TERMS OF DEGREE**Terms of degree are not necessarily indefinite.
 "Claim language employing terms of degree has long been found definite where it
 provided enough certainty to one of skill in the art when read in the context of
 the invention." *Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,* 766 F.3d
 1364, 1370, 112 USPQ2d 1188, 1192-93 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (citing *Eibel
 Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co.,* 261 U.S. 45, 65-66
 (1923) (finding ‘substantial pitch’ sufficiently definite because one skilled in
 the art ‘had no difficulty … in determining what was the substantial pitch needed’
 to practice the invention)). Thus, when a term of degree is used in the claim, the
 examiner should determine whether the specification provides some standard for
 measuring that degree. *Hearing Components, Inc. v. Shure Inc.,*
 600 F.3d 1357, 1367, 94 USPQ2d 1385, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *Enzo Biochem,
 Inc., v. Applera Corp.,* 599 F.3d 1325, 1332, 94 USPQ2d 1321, 1326
 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *Seattle Box Co., Inc. v. Indus. Crating & Packing,
 Inc.,* 731 F.2d 818, 826, 221 USPQ 568, 574 (Fed. Cir. 1984). If the
 specification does not provide some standard for measuring that degree, a
 determination must be made as to whether one of ordinary skill in the art could
 nevertheless ascertain the scope of the claim (e.g., a standard that is recognized
 in the art for measuring the meaning of the term of degree). For example, in
 *Ex parte Oetiker,* 23 USPQ2d 1641 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992), the phrases "relatively shallow," "of the order of," "the order of about
 5mm," and "substantial portion" were held to be indefinite because the
 specification lacked some standard for measuring the degrees intended.
 


The claim is not indefinite if the specification
 provides examples or teachings that can be used to measure a degree even without a
 precise numerical measurement (e.g., a figure that provides a standard for
 measuring the meaning of the term of degree). See, e.g., *Interval
 Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,* 766 F.3d 1364, 1371-72, 112 USPQ2d 1188,
 1193 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (observing that although there is no absolute or
 mathematical precision required, "[t]he claims, when read in light of the
 specification and the prosecution history, must provide objective boundaries for
 those of skill in the art"). 
 


During prosecution, an applicant may also overcome
 an indefiniteness rejection by providing evidence that the meaning of the term of
 degree can be ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art when reading the
 disclosure. For example, in *Enzo Biochem,* the applicant
 submitted a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** showing examples
 that met the claim limitation and examples that did not. *Enzo
 Biochem,* 599 F.3d at 1335, 94 USPQ2d at 1328 (noting that applicant
 overcame an indefiniteness rejection over "not interfering substantially" claim
 language by submitting a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** listing eight
 specific linkage groups that applicant declared did not substantially interfere
 with hybridization or detection). 
 


 Even if the specification uses the same term of
 degree as in the claim, a rejection is proper if the scope of the term is not
 understood when read in light of the specification. While, as a general
 proposition, broadening modifiers are standard tools in claim drafting in order to
 avoid reliance on the doctrine of equivalents in infringement actions, when the
 scope of the claim is unclear a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is proper. See *In re Wiggins,* 488 F. 2d 538, 541,
 179 USPQ 421, 423 (CCPA 1973).
 


When relative terms are used in claims wherein the improvement
 over the prior art rests entirely upon size or weight of an element in a
 combination of elements, the adequacy of the disclosure of a standard is of
 greater criticality.
 

**II.** **REFERENCE TO AN OBJECT THAT IS VARIABLE MAY RENDER A CLAIM
 INDEFINITE**A claim may be rendered indefinite by reference to an object that
 is variable. See, e.g., *Ex parte Miyazaki,* 89 USPQ2d 1207 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 2008) (precedential) and *Ex parte
 Brummer,* 12 USPQ2d 1653 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). In
 *Miyazaki,* the Board held that claims to a large printer were
 not sufficiently definite because:
 



> 
> The language of claim 1 attempts to claim the
>  height of the paper feeding unit in relation to a user of a specific height who
>  is performing operations on the printer.... Claim 1 fails to specify, however,
>  a positional relationship of the user and the printer to each other. 
>  
> 
> 
> 


*Miyazaki,* 89 USPQ2d at 1212. In *Brummer,* the
 Board held that a limitation in a claim to a bicycle that recited "said front and
 rear wheels so spaced as to give a wheelbase that is between 58 percent and 75
 percent of the height of the rider that the bicycle was designed for" was
 indefinite because the relationship of parts was not based on any known standard
 for sizing a bicycle to a rider, but on a rider of unspecified build.
 *Brummer,* 12 USPQ2d at 1655.
 


On the other hand, a claim limitation specifying
 that a certain part of a pediatric wheelchair be "so dimensioned as to be
 insertable through the space between the doorframe of an automobile and one of the
 seats" was held to be definite. *Orthokinetics, Inc.**v.**Safety Travel Chairs, Inc.,* 806 F.2d 1565, 1 USPQ2d 1081 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986). The court stated that the phrase "so dimensioned" is as accurate as
 the subject matter permits, noting that the patent law does not require that all
 possible lengths corresponding to the spaces in hundreds of different automobiles
 be listed in the patent, let alone that they be listed in the claims.
 

**III.** **APPROXIMATIONS*** 

***A.******"About"***In determining the range encompassed by the term
 
 "about"
 
 
 , one must
 consider the context of the term as it is used in the specification and claims
 of the application. *Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v. Caraco Pharm. Labs.,
 Ltd.,* 476 F.3d 1321, 1326, 81 USPQ2d 1427, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
 In*W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc.**v.**Garlock, Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 220 USPQ 303 (Fed. Cir. 1983),
 the court held that a limitation defining the stretch rate of a plastic as
 "exceeding about 10% per second" is definite because infringement could clearly
 be assessed through the use of a stopwatch. However, in another case, the court
 held that claims reciting "at least about" were invalid for indefiniteness
 where there was close prior art and there was nothing in the specification,
 prosecution history, or the prior art to provide any indication as to what
 range of specific activity is covered by the term "about." *Amgen, Inc.* *v.**Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 18 USPQ2d 1016
 (Fed. Cir. 1991).
 

***B.******"Essentially"***The phrase "a silicon dioxide source that is essentially free
 of alkali metal" was held to be definite because the specification contained
 guidelines and examples that were considered sufficient to enable a person of
 ordinary skill in the art to draw a line between unavoidable impurities in
 starting materials and essential ingredients. *In re**Marosi,* 710 F.2d 799, 218 USPQ 289 (CCPA 1983). The court
 further observed that it would be impractical to require applicants to specify
 a particular number as a cutoff between their invention and the prior art.
 

***C.******"Similar"***The term "similar" in the preamble of a claim that was
 directed to a nozzle "for high-pressure cleaning units or similar apparatus"
 was held to be indefinite since it was not clear what applicant intended to
 cover by the recitation "similar" apparatus. *Ex parte**Kristensen,* 10 USPQ2d 1701 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1989).
 


A claim in a design patent application which read: "The
 ornamental design for a feed bunk or similar structure as shown and described."
 was held to be indefinite because it was unclear from the specification what
 applicant intended to cover by the recitation of "similar structure."
 *Ex parte**Pappas,* 23 USPQ2d 1636 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1992).
 

***D.******"Substantially"***The term "substantially" is often used in conjunction with
 another term to describe a particular characteristic of the claimed invention.
 It is a broad term. *In re**Nehrenberg,* 280 F.2d 161, 126 USPQ 383 (CCPA 1960). The
 court held that the limitation "to substantially increase the efficiency of the
 compound as a copper extractant" was definite in view of the general guidelines
 contained in the specification. *In re**Mattison,* 509 F.2d 563, 184 USPQ 484 (CCPA 1975). The court
 held that the limitation "which produces substantially equal E and H plane
 illumination patterns" was definite because one of ordinary skill in the art
 would know what was meant by "substantially equal." *Andrew
 Corp.**v.**Gabriel Electronics,* 847 F.2d 819, 6 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir.
 1988).
 

***E.******"Type"***The addition of the word "type" to an otherwise definite
 expression (e.g., Friedel-Crafts catalyst) extends the scope of the expression
 so as to render it indefinite.  *Ex parte**Copenhaver,* 109 USPQ 118 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1955).
 Likewise, the phrase "ZSM-5-type aluminosilicate zeolites" was held to be
 indefinite because it was unclear what "type" was intended to convey. The
 interpretation was made more difficult by the fact that the zeolites defined in
 the dependent claims were not within the genus of the type of zeolites defined
 in the independent claim. *Ex parte**Attig,* 7 USPQ2d 1092 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986).
 

**IV.** **SUBJECTIVE TERMS**When a subjective term is used in the claim, the
 examiner should determine whether the specification supplies some standard for
 measuring the scope of the term, similar to the analysis for a term of degree.
 Some objective standard must be provided in order to allow the public to determine
 the scope of the claim. A claim that requires the exercise of subjective judgment
 without restriction may render the claim indefinite. *In re
 Musgrave,* 431 F.2d 882, 893, 167 USPQ 280, 289 (CCPA 1970). Claim
 scope cannot depend solely on the unrestrained, subjective opinion of a particular
 individual purported to be practicing the invention. *Datamize LLC v.
 Plumtree Software, Inc.,* 417 F.3d 1342, 1350, 75 USPQ2d 1801, 1807
 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); see also *Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL,
 Inc.,* 766 F.3d 1364, 1373, 112 USPQ2d 1188 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding
 the claim phrase "unobtrusive manner" indefinite because the specification did not
 "provide a reasonably clear and exclusive definition, leaving the facially
 subjective claim language without an objective boundary"). 
 


For example, in *Datamize,* the
 invention was directed to a computer interface screen with an "aesthetically
 pleasing look and feel." *Datamize,* 417 F.3d at 1344-45. The
 meaning of the term "aesthetically pleasing" depended solely on the subjective
 opinion of the person selecting features to be included on the interface screen.
 Nothing in the intrinsic evidence (e.g., the specification) provided any guidance
 as to what design choices would result in an "aesthetically pleasing" look and
 feel. *Id.* at 1352. The claims were held indefinite because the
 interface screen may be "aesthetically pleasing" to one user but not to another.
 *Id.* at 1350. See also *Ex parte Anderson,*
 21 USPQ2d 1241 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991) (the terms "comparable" and
 "superior" were held to be indefinite in the context of a limitation relating the
 characteristics of the claimed material to other materials). 
 


During prosecution, the applicant may overcome a
 rejection by amending the claim to remove the subjective term, or by providing
 evidence that the meaning of the term can be ascertained by one of ordinary skill
 in the art when reading the disclosure. However, "[f]or some facially subjective
 terms, the definiteness requirement is not satisfied by merely offering examples
 that satisfy the term within the specification." *DDR Holdings, LLC v.
 Hotels.com, L.P.,* 773 F.3d 1245, 1261, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1108 (Fed.
 Cir. 2014).

# 2173.05(c) Numerical Ranges and Amounts Limitations [R-11.2013]


Generally, the recitation of specific numerical ranges in a claim
 does not raise an issue of whether a claim is definite.
 

**I.** **NARROW AND BROADER RANGES IN THE SAME CLAIM**Use of a narrow numerical range that falls within a broader range
 in the same claim may render the claim indefinite when the boundaries of the claim
 are not discernible. Description of examples and preferences is properly set forth
 in the specification rather than in a single claim. A narrower range or preferred
 embodiment may also be set forth in another independent claim or in a dependent
 claim. If stated in a single claim, examples and preferences lead to confusion
 over the intended scope of the claim. In those instances where it is not clear
 whether the claimed narrower range is a limitation, a rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph should be made. The Examiner should analyze whether the metes and bounds
 of the claim are clearly set forth. Examples of claim language which have been
 held to be indefinite are (A) "a temperature of between 45 and 78 degrees Celsius,
 preferably between 50 and 60 degrees Celsius"; and (B) "a predetermined quantity,
 for example, the maximum capacity."
 


While a single claim that includes both a broad and a narrower
 range may be indefinite, it is not improper under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, to present a dependent claim that sets forth a narrower range for an
 element than the range set forth in the claim from which it depends. For example,
 if claim 1 reads "A circuit … wherein the resistance is 70-150 ohms." and claim 2
 reads "The circuit of claim 1 wherein the resistance is 70-100 ohms.", then claim
 2 should not be rejected as indefinite. 
 

**II.** **OPEN-ENDED NUMERICAL RANGES**Open-ended numerical ranges should be carefully analyzed for
 definiteness. For example, when an independent claim recites a composition
 comprising "at least 20% sodium" and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts
 of nonsodium ingredients which add up to 100%, apparently to the exclusion of
 sodium, an ambiguity is created with regard to the "at least" limitation (unless
 the percentages of the nonsodium ingredients are based on the weight of the
 nonsodium ingredients). On the other hand, the court held that a composition
 claimed to have a theoretical content greater than 100% (i.e., 20-80% of A, 20-80%
 of B  and 1-25% of C) was not indefinite simply because the claims may be read in
 theory to include compositions that are impossible in fact to formulate. It was
 observed that subject matter which cannot exist in fact can neither anticipate nor
 infringe a claim. *In re**Kroekel,* 504 F.2d 1143, 183 USPQ 610 (CCPA 1974).
 


In a claim directed to a chemical reaction process, a limitation
 required that the amount of one ingredient in the reaction mixture should "be
 maintained at less than 7 mole percent" based on the amount of another ingredient.
 The examiner argued that the claim was indefinite because the limitation sets only
 a maximum amount and is inclusive of substantially no ingredient resulting in
 termination of any reaction. The court did not agree, holding that the claim was
 clearly directed to a reaction process, and explaining that "[t]he imposition of a
 maximum limit on the quantity of one of the reactants without specifying a minimum
 does not warrant distorting the overall meaning of the claim to preclude
 performing the claimed process."*In re**Kirsch,* 498 F.2d 1389, 1394, 182 USPQ 286, 290 (CCPA 1974).
 


Some terms have been determined to have the following meanings in
 the factual situations of the reported cases: the term "up to" includes zero as a
 lower limit, *In re**Mochel,* 470 F.2d 638, 176 USPQ 194 (CCPA 1974); and "a moisture
 content of not more than 70% by weight" reads on dry material, *Ex
 parte**Khusid,* 174 USPQ 59 (Bd. App. 1971).
 

**III.** **"EFFECTIVE AMOUNT"**The common phrase "an effective amount" may or may not be
 indefinite. The proper test is whether or not one skilled in the art could
 determine specific values for the amount based on the disclosure. See *In
 re**Mattison,* 509 F.2d 563, 184 USPQ 484 (CCPA 1975). The phrase
 "an effective amount . . . for growth stimulation" was held to be definite where
 the amount was not critical and those skilled in the art would be able to
 determine from the written disclosure, including the examples, what an effective
 amount is. *In re**Halleck,* 422 F.2d 911, 164 USPQ 647 (CCPA 1970). The phrase "an
 effective amount" has been held to be indefinite when the claim fails to state the
 function which is to be achieved and more than one effect can be implied from the
 specification or the relevant art. *In re**Fredericksen,* 213 F.2d 547, 102 USPQ 35 (CCPA 1954). The more
 recent cases have tended to accept a limitation such as "an effective amount" as
 being definite when read in light of the supporting disclosure and in the absence
 of any prior art which would give rise to uncertainty about the scope of the
 claim. In *Ex parte**Skuballa,* 12 USPQ2d 1570 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989), the
 Board held that a pharmaceutical composition claim which recited an "effective
 amount of a compound of claim 1" without stating the function to be achieved was
 definite, particularly when read in light of the supporting disclosure which
 provided guidelines as to the intended utilities and how the uses could be
 effected.

# 2173.05(d) Exemplary Claim Language ("for example," "such
 as") [R-07.2015]


Description of examples or preferences is properly set forth in the
 specification rather than the claims. If stated in the claims, examples and
 preferences may lead to confusion over the intended scope of a claim. In those
 instances where it is not clear whether the claimed narrower range is a limitation, a
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph should be made. The examiner
 should analyze whether the metes and bounds of the claim are clearly set forth. Note
 that the mere use of the phrase "such as" or "for example" in a claim does not by
 itself render the claim indefinite.
 


 Examples of claim language which have been held to be
 indefinite because the intended scope of the claim was unclear are: 
 


* (A) "R is halogen, for example, chlorine";
* (B) "material such as rock wool or asbestos" *Ex
 parte**Hall,* 83 USPQ 38 (Bd. App. 1949);
* (C) "lighter hydrocarbons, such, for example, as the vapors or gas
 produced" *Ex parte**Hasche,* 86 USPQ 481 (Bd. App. 1949);
* (D) "normal operating conditions such as while in the container of
 a proportioner" *Ex parte**Steigerwald,* 131 USPQ 74 (Bd. App. 1961); and
* (E) "coke, brick, or like material". *Ex
 parte Caldwell,* 1906 C.D. 58 (Comm’r Pat. 1906).


The above examples of claim language which have been held to be
 indefinite are fact specific and should not be applied as
 *per se* rules. See **[MPEP § 2173.02](s2173.html#d0e217598)** for guidance
 regarding when it is appropriate to make a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 


, 
# 2173.05(e) Lack of Antecedent Basis [R-08.2017]


A claim is indefinite when it contains words or phrases whose
 meaning is unclear. *In re Packard,* 751 F.3d 1307, 1314, 110 USPQ2d
 1785, 1789 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The lack of clarity could arise where a claim refers to
 "said lever" or "the lever," where the claim contains no earlier recitation or
 limitation of a lever and where it would be unclear as to what element the limitation
 was making reference. Similarly, if two different levers are recited earlier in the
 claim, the recitation of "said lever" in the same or subsequent claim would be
 unclear where it is uncertain which of the two levers was intended. A claim which
 refers to "said aluminum lever," but recites only "a lever" earlier in the claim, is
 indefinite because it is uncertain as to the lever to which reference is made.
 Obviously, however, the failure to provide explicit antecedent basis for terms does
 not always render a claim indefinite. If the scope of a claim would be reasonably
 ascertainable by those skilled in the art, then the claim is not indefinite.
 *Ex parte Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144, 1145 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1992) ("controlled stream of fluid" provided reasonable antecedent basis for
 "the controlled fluid"). Inherent components of elements recited have antecedent
 basis in the recitation of the components themselves. For example, the limitation
 "the outer surface of said sphere" would not require an antecedent recitation that
 the sphere has an outer surface. See *Bose Corp. v. JBL, Inc.,* 274
 F.3d 1354, 1359, 61 USPQ2d 1216, 1218-19 (Fed. Cir 2001) (holding that recitation of
 "an ellipse" provided antecedent basis for "an ellipse having a major diameter"
 because "[t]here can be no dispute that mathematically an inherent characteristic of
 an ellipse is a major diameter").
 

**I.** **EXAMINER SHOULD SUGGEST CORRECTIONS TO ANTECEDENT PROBLEMS**Antecedent problems in the claims are typically drafting
 oversights that are easily corrected once they are brought to the attention of
 applicant. The examiner’s task of making sure the claim language complies with the
 requirements of the statute should be carried out in a positive and constructive
 way, so that minor problems can be identified and easily corrected, and so that
 the major effort is expended on more substantive issues. However, even though
 indefiniteness in claim language is of semantic origin, it is not rendered
 unobjectionable simply because it could have been corrected. *In re
 Hammack,* 427 F.2d 1384, 1388 n.5, 166 USPQ 209, 213 n.5 (CCPA
 1970).
 

**II.** **A CLAIM TERM WHICH HAS NO ANTECEDENT BASIS IN THE DISCLOSURE IS NOT
 NECESSARILY INDEFINITE**The mere fact that a term or phrase used in the claim has no
 antecedent basis in the specification disclosure does not mean, necessarily, that
 the term or phrase is indefinite. There is no requirement that the words in the
 claim must match those used in the specification disclosure. Applicants are given
 a great deal of latitude in how they choose to define their invention so long as
 the terms and phrases used define the invention with a reasonable degree of
 clarity and precision. 
 

**III.** **A CLAIM IS NOT *PER SE* INDEFINITE IF THE BODY OF THE
 CLAIM RECITES ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR IN THE PREAMBLE**The mere fact that the body of a claim recites additional
 elements which do not appear in the claim’s preamble does not render the claim
 indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. See *In re
 Larsen,* 10 Fed. App'x 890 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (The preamble of the
 *Larsen* claim recited only a hanger and a loop but the body
 of the claim positively recited a linear member. The examiner rejected the claim
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, because the omission from the claim’s
 preamble of a critical element (i.e., a linear member) renders that claim
 indefinite. The court reversed the examiner’s rejection and stated that the
 totality of all the limitations of the claim and their interaction with each other
 must be considered to ascertain the inventor’s contribution to the art. Upon
 review of the claim in its entirety, the court concluded that the claim at issue
 apprises one of ordinary skill in the art of its scope and, therefore, serves the
 notice function required by **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, paragraph 2.).
 
 


, 
# 2173.05(f) Reference to Limitations in Another Claim [R-11.2013]


A claim which makes reference to a preceding claim to define a
 limitation is an acceptable claim construction which should not necessarily be
 rejected as improper or confusing under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. For example, claims which read:
 "The product produced by the method of claim 1." or "A method of producing ethanol
 comprising contacting amylose with the culture of claim 1 under the following
 conditions ....." are not indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, merely because of the reference to another claim. See also *Ex
 parte**Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (where
 reference to "the nozzle of claim 7" in a method claim was held to comply with
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph). However, where the format of making
 reference to limitations recited in another claim results in confusion, then a
 rejection would be proper under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. 
 


When examining a dependent claim, the examiner should
 also determine whether the claim complies with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, fourth
 paragraph. See **[MPEP §
 608.01(n)](s608.html#d0e45256)**, subsection II.

# 2173.05(g) Functional Limitations [R-08.2017]


A claim term is functional when it recites a feature "by what it
 does rather than by what it is" (e.g., as evidenced by its specific structure or
 specific ingredients). *In re**Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 212, 169 USPQ 226, 229 (CCPA 1971). There
 is nothing inherently wrong with defining some part of an invention in functional
 terms. Functional language does not, in and of itself, render a claim improper.
 *Id.* In fact, **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, expressly authorize a form of
 functional claiming (means- (or step-) plus- function claim limitations discussed in
 **[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)***et seq.*). Functional language may also be employed to limit the
 claims without using the means-plus-function format. See, e.g., *K-2 Corp. v.
 Salomon S.A.,* 191 F.3d 1356, 1363, 52 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir.
 1999). Unlike means-plus-function claim language that applies only to purely
 functional limitations, *Phillips v. AWH Corp.,* 415 F.3d 1303,
 1311, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2005) *(en banc)*
 ("Means-plus-function claiming applies only to purely functional limitations that do
 not provide the structure that performs the recited function."), functional claiming
 often involves the recitation of some structure followed by its function. For
 example, in *In re Schreiber,* the claims were directed to a conical
 spout (the structure) that "allow[ed] several kernels of popped popcorn to pass
 through at the same time" (the function). *In re Schreiber,* 128
 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997). As noted by the court in
 *Schreiber,* "[a] patent applicant is free to recite features of
 an apparatus either structurally or functionally." *Id.*


A functional limitation must be evaluated and considered, just like
 any other limitation of the claim, for what it fairly conveys to a person of ordinary
 skill in the pertinent art in the context in which it is used. A functional
 limitation is often used in association with an element, ingredient, or step of a
 process to define a particular capability or purpose that is served by the recited
 element, ingredient or step. In *Innova/Pure Water Inc. v. Safari Water
 Filtration Sys. Inc.,* 381 F.3d 1111, 1117-20, 72 USPQ2d 1001, 1006-08
 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court noted that the claim term "operatively connected" is "a
 general descriptive claim term frequently used in patent drafting to reflect a
 functional relationship between claimed components," that is, the term "means the
 claimed components must be connected in a way to perform a designated function." "In
 the absence of modifiers, general descriptive terms are typically construed as having
 their full meaning." *Id.* at 1118, 72 USPQ2d at 1006. In the patent
 claim at issue, "subject to any clear and unmistakable disavowal of claim scope, the
 term ‘operatively connected’ takes the full breath of its ordinary meaning, i.e.,
 ‘said tube [is] operatively connected to said cap’ when the tube and cap are arranged
 in a manner capable of performing the function of filtering." *Id.*
 at 1120, 72 USPQ2d at 1008.
 


Other examples of permissible function language include the
 following. 
 



It was held that the limitation used to define a
 radical on a chemical compound as "incapable of forming a dye with said oxidizing
 developing agent" although functional, was perfectly acceptable because it set
 definite boundaries on the patent protection sought. *In re
 Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971). 
 




In a claim that was directed to a kit of component
 parts capable of being assembled, the court held that limitations such as "members
 adapted to be positioned" and "portions . . . being resiliently dilatable whereby
 said housing may be slidably positioned" serve to precisely define present
 structural attributes of interrelated component parts of the claimed assembly.
 *In re Venezia,* 530 F.2d 956, 189 USPQ 149 (CCPA 1976).
 



Notwithstanding the permissible instances, the use of
 functional language in a claim may fail "to provide a clear-cut indication of the
 scope of the subject matter embraced by the claim" and thus be indefinite.
 *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 213 (CCPA 1971). For example,
 when claims merely recite a description of a problem to be solved or a function or
 result achieved by the invention, the boundaries of the claim scope may be unclear.
 *Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v. M-I LLC,* 514 F.3d 1244,
 1255, 85 USPQ2d 1654, 1663 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that the Supreme Court explained
 that a vice of functional claiming occurs "when the inventor is painstaking when he
 recites what has already been seen, and then uses conveniently functional language at
 the exact point of novelty") (quoting *General Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance
 Corp.,* 304 U.S. 364, 371 (1938)); see also *United Carbon Co. v.
 Binney & Smith Co.,* 317 U.S. 228, 234 (1942) (holding indefinite
 claims that recited substantially pure carbon black "in the form of commercially
 uniform, comparatively small, rounded smooth aggregates having a spongy or porous
 exterior"). Further, without reciting the particular structure, materials or steps
 that accomplish the function or achieve the result, all means or methods of resolving
 the problem may be encompassed by the claim. *Ariad Pharmaceuticals., Inc. v.
 Eli Lilly & Co.,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1353, 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1173 (Fed.
 Cir. 2010) *(en banc)*. See also *Datamize LLC v. Plumtree
 Software Inc.,* 75 USPQ2d 1801 (Fed. Cir. 2005) where a claim directed to
 a software based system for creating a customized computer interface screen recited
 that the screen be "aesthetically pleasing," which is an intended result and does not
 provide a clear cut indication of scope because it imposed no structural limits on
 the screen. Unlimited functional claim limitations that extend to all means or
 methods of resolving a problem may not be adequately supported by the written
 description or may not be commensurate in scope with the enabling disclosure, both of
 which are required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. *In re Hyatt,*
 708 F.2d 712, 714, 218 USPQ 195, 197 (Fed. Cir. 1983); *Ariad,* 598
 F.3d at 1340, 94 USPQ2d at 1167. For instance, a single means claim covering every
 conceivable means for achieving the stated result was held to be invalid under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph because the court recognized that the
 specification, which disclosed only those means known to the inventor, was not
 commensurate in scope with the claim. *Hyatt,* 708 F.2d at 714-715,
 218 USPQ at 197. For more information regarding the written description requirement

 2161](s2161.html#d0e213359)**-**[2164.08(c)](s2164.html#d0e216899)**. Examiners should keep in
 mind that whether or not the functional limitation complies with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is a different issue from whether the limitation is properly supported
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, or is distinguished over the prior art. 
 


When a claim limitation employs functional language,
 the examiner’s determination of whether the limitation is sufficiently definite will
 be highly dependent on context (e.g., the disclosure in the specification and the
 knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art). *Halliburton Energy
 Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255, 85 USPQ2d at 1663. For example, a claim that
 included the term "fragile gel" was found to be indefinite because the definition of
 the term in the specification was functional, i.e., the fluid is defined by what it
 does rather than what it is ("ability of the fluid to transition quickly from gel to
 liquid, and the ability of the fluid to suspend drill cuttings at rest"), and it was
 ambiguous as to the requisite degree of the fragileness of the gel, the ability of
 the gel to suspend drill cuttings (i.e., gel strength), and/or some combination of
 the two. *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255-56, 85 USPQ2d
 at 1663. In another example, the claims directed to a tungsten filament for electric
 incandescent lamps were held invalid for including a limitation that recited
 "comparatively large grains of such size and contour as to prevent substantial
 sagging or offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for such a lamp or
 other device." *General Elec. Co.,* 304 U.S. at 370-71, 375. The
 Court observed that the prior art filaments also "consisted of comparatively large
 crystals" but they were "subject to offsetting" or shifting, and the Court further
 found that the phrase "of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and
 offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for a lamp or other device"
 did not adequately define the structural characteristics of the grains (e.g., the
 size and contour) to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art.
 *Id.* at 370. Similarly, a claim was held invalid because it
 recited "sustantially (sic) pure carbon black in the form of commercially uniform,
 comparatively small, rounded smooth aggregates having a spongy or porous exterior."
 *United Carbon Co.,* 317 U.S. at 234. In the latter example, the
 Court observed various problems with the limitation: "commercially uniform" meant
 only the degree of uniformity buyers desired; "comparatively small" did not add
 anything because no standard for comparison was given; and "spongy" and "porous" are
 synonyms that the Court found unhelpful in distinguishing the claimed invention from
 the prior art. *Id.* at 233. 
 


In comparison, a claim limitation reciting
 "transparent to infrared rays" was held to be definite because the specification
 showed that a substantial amount of infrared radiation was always transmitted even
 though the degree of transparency varied depending on certain factors.
 *Swinehart,* 439 F.2d at 214, 169 USPQ at 230. Likewise, the
 claims in another case were held definite because applicant provided "a general
 guideline and examples sufficient to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to
 determine whether a process uses a silicon dioxide source ‘essentially free of alkali
 metal’ to make a reaction mixture ‘essentially free of alkali metal’ to produce a
 zeolitic compound ‘essentially free of alkali metal.’" *In re
 Marosi,* 710 F.2d 799, 803, 218 USPQ 289, 293 (Fed. Cir. 1983). 
 


Examiners should consider the following factors when
 examining claims that contain functional language to determine whether the language
 is ambiguous: (1) whether there is a clear cut indication of the scope of the subject
 matter covered by the claim; (2) whether the language sets forth well-defined
 boundaries of the invention or only states a problem solved or a result obtained; and
 (3) whether one of ordinary skill in the art would know from the claim terms what
 structure or steps are encompassed by the claim. These factors are examples of points
 to be considered when determining whether language is ambiguous and are not intended
 to be all inclusive or limiting. Other factors may be more relevant for particular
 arts. The primary inquiry is whether the language leaves room for ambiguity or
 whether the boundaries are clear and precise. 
 


During prosecution, applicant may resolve the
 ambiguities of a functional limitation in a number of ways. For example: (1) "the
 ambiguity might be resolved by using a quantitative metric (e.g., numeric limitation
 as to a physical property) rather than a qualitative functional feature" (see
 *Halliburton Energy Servs.,* 514 F.3d at 1255-56, 85 USPQ2d at
 1663); (2) applicant could demonstrate that the "specification provide[s] a formula
 for calculating a property along with examples that meet the claim limitation and
 examples that do not" (see *id.* at 1256, 85 USPQ2d at 1663 (citing
 *Oakley, Inc. v. Sunglass Hut Int’l,* 316 F.3d 1331, 1341, 65
 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003))); (3) applicant could demonstrate that the
 specification provides a general guideline and examples sufficient to teach a person
 skilled in the art when the claim limitation was satisfied (see
 *Marosi,* 710 F.2d at 803, 218 USPQ at 292); or (4) applicant
 could amend the claims to recite the particular structure that accomplishes the
 function.

# 2173.05(h) Alternative Limitations [R-10.2019]

**I.** **MARKUSH GROUPS**A claim which recites a list of alternatives to
 define a limitation is an acceptable claim construction which should not
 necessarily be rejected as confusing under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or as improper. See **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)** for guidelines regarding the determination of
 whether a Markush grouping is improper.
 


Treatment of claims reciting alternatives is not governed by the
 particular format used (e.g., alternatives may be set forth as "a material
 selected from the group consisting of A, B, and C" or "wherein the material is A,
 B, or C"). See, e.g., the *Supplementary Examination Guidelines for
 Determining Compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112 and for Treatment of Related Issues
 in Patent Applications* ("Supplementary Guidelines"), 76 Fed. Reg.
 7162, 7166 (February 9, 2011). Claims that set forth a list of alternatives from
 which a selection is to be made are typically referred to as Markush claims, after
 the appellant in *Ex parte Markush,* 1925 Dec. Comm’r Pat. 126,
 127 (1924). The listing of specified alternatives within a Markush claim is
 referred to as a Markush group or Markush grouping. *Abbott Labs v. Baxter
 Pharmaceutical Products, Inc.,* 334 F.3d 1274, 1280-81, 67 USPQ2d
 1191, 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing to several sources that describe Markush
 groups).
 


See **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)** for a general discussion of Markush claims and
 guidelines regarding the determination of whether a Markush grouping is improper,
 and **[MPEP §
 803.02](s803.html#d0e98237)** for a discussion of election requirements in
 Markush claims.
 


A Markush grouping is a closed group of
 alternatives, i.e., the selection is made from a group "consisting of" (rather
 than "comprising" or "including") the alternative members. *Abbott
 Labs.,* 334 F.3d at 1280, 67 USPQ2d at 1196. If a Markush grouping
 requires a material selected from an open list of alternatives (e.g., selected
 from the group "comprising" or "consisting essentially of" the recited
 alternatives), the claim should generally be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** as indefinite because it is unclear what other
 alternatives are intended to be encompassed by the claim. If a claim is intended
 to encompass combinations or mixtures of the alternatives set forth in the Markush
 grouping, the claim may include qualifying language preceding the recited
 alternatives (such as "at least one member" selected from the group), or within
 the list of alternatives (such as "or mixtures thereof"). *Id.*
 at 1281. See also **[MPEP § 2111.03](s2111.html#d0e200824)**. 
 


A Markush grouping may include a large number of
 alternatives, and as a result a Markush claim may encompass a large number of
 alternative members or embodiments, but a claim is not necessarily indefinite
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** for such breadth. *In re
 Gardner,* 427 F.2d 786, 788, 166 USPQ 138, 140 (CCPA 1970) ("Breadth
 is not indefiniteness."). In certain circumstances, however, a Markush group may
 be so expansive that persons skilled in the art cannot determine the metes and
 bounds of the claimed invention. For example, if a claim defines a chemical
 compound using one or more Markush groups, and that claim encompasses a massive
 number of distinct alternative members, the claim may be indefinite under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** if one skilled in the art cannot determine its
 metes and bounds due to an inability to envision all of the compounds defined by
 the Markush group(s). In such a circumstance, a rejection of the claim for
 indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** is
 appropriate.
 


The use of Markush claims of diminishing scope should not, in
 itself, be considered a sufficient basis for objection to or rejection of claims.
 However, if such a practice renders the claims indefinite or if it results in
 undue multiplicity, an appropriate rejection should be made. 
 


Similarly, the double inclusion of an element by members of a
 Markush group is not, in itself, sufficient basis for objection to or rejection of
 claims. Rather, the facts in each case must be evaluated to determine whether or
 not the multiple inclusion of one or more elements in a claim renders that claim
 indefinite. The mere fact that a compound may be embraced by more than one member
 of a Markush group recited in the claim does not necessarily render the scope of
 the claim unclear. For example, the Markush group, "selected from the group
 consisting of amino, halogen, nitro, chloro and alkyl" should be acceptable even
 though "halogen" is generic to "chloro." See, e.g., *Eli Lilly & Co.
 v. Teva Parenteral Meds.,* 845 F.3d 1357, 1371,121 USPQ2d 1277, 1287
 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (redundancy of including both "vitamin B12" and "cyanocobalamin"
 (which were recognized on the record as referencing the same compound) within a
 Markush group of methylmalonic acid lowering agents did not render the claims
 indefinite).
 

**II.** **"OPTIONALLY"**Another alternative format which requires some analysis before
 concluding whether or not the language is indefinite involves the use of the term
 "optionally." In *Ex parte**Cordova,* 10 USPQ2d 1949 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989) the
 language "containing A, B, and optionally C" was considered acceptable alternative
 language because there was no ambiguity as to which alternatives are covered by
 the claim. A similar holding was reached with regard to the term "optionally" in
 *Ex parte**Wu,* 10 USPQ2d 2031 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). In the
 instance where the list of potential alternatives can vary and ambiguity arises,
 then it is proper to make a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** and explain why there is confusion.

# 2173.05(i) Negative Limitations [R-08.2017]


The current view of the courts is that there is nothing inherently
 ambiguous or uncertain about a negative limitation. So long as the boundaries of the
 patent protection sought are set forth definitely, albeit negatively, the claim
 complies with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. Some older cases were critical
 of negative limitations because they tended to define the invention in terms of what
 it was not, rather than pointing out the invention. Thus, the court observed that the
 limitation "R is an alkenyl radical other than 2-butenyl and 2,4-pentadienyl" was a
 negative limitation that rendered the claim indefinite because it was an attempt to
 claim the invention by excluding what the inventors did not invent rather than
 distinctly and particularly pointing out what they did invent. *In re
 Schechter,* 205 F.2d 185, 98 USPQ 144 (CCPA 1953).
 


A claim which recited the limitation "said homopolymer being free
 from the proteins, soaps, resins, and sugars present in natural Hevea rubber" in
 order to exclude the characteristics of the prior art product, was considered
 definite because each recited limitation was definite. *In re
 Wakefield,* 422 F.2d 897, 899, 904, 164 USPQ 636, 638, 641 (CCPA 1970).
 In addition, the court found that the negative limitation "incapable of forming a dye
 with said oxidized developing agent" was definite because the boundaries of the
 patent protection sought were clear. *In re Barr,* 444 F.2d 588, 170
 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971).
 


Any negative limitation or exclusionary proviso must have basis in
 the original disclosure. If alternative elements are positively recited in the
 specification, they may be explicitly excluded in the claims. See *In re
 Johnson,* 558 F.2d 1008, 1019, 194 USPQ 187, 196 (CCPA 1977) ("[the]
 specification, having described the whole, necessarily described the part
 remaining."). See also *Ex parte Grasselli,* 231 USPQ 393 (Bd. App.
 1983), *aff’d mem.,* 738 F.2d 453 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In describing
 alternative features, the applicant need not articulate advantages or disadvantages
 of each feature in order to later exclude the alternative features. See
 *Inphi Corporation v. Netlist, Inc.,* 805 F.3d 1350, 1356-57, 116
 USPQ2d 2006, 2010-11 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The mere absence of a positive recitation is
 not basis for an exclusion. Any claim containing a negative limitation which does not
 have basis in the original disclosure should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, as failing to comply with the written description requirement. Note that a
 lack of literal basis in the specification for a negative limitation may not be
 sufficient to establish a *prima facie* case for lack of descriptive
 support. *Ex parte Parks,* 30 USPQ2d 1234, 1236 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1993). See **[MPEP
 § 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** - **[§ 2163.07(b)](s2163.html#d0e215198)** for a discussion of the
 written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph.
 


, 
# 2173.05(j) Old Combination [R-11.2013]

**A CLAIM SHOULD NOT BE REJECTED ON THE GROUND OF OLD COMBINATION**With the passage of the 1952 Patent Act, the courts and the Board
 have taken the view that a rejection based on the principle of old combination is
 NO LONGER VALID. Claims should be considered proper so long as they comply with
 the provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. 
 


A rejection on the basis of old combination was based on the
 principle applied in *Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner
 Corp.,* 303 U.S. 545, 37 USPQ 1 (1938). The principle was that an
 inventor who made an improvement or contribution to but one element of a generally
 old combination, should not be able to obtain a patent on the entire combination
 including the new and improved element. A rejection required the citation of a
 single reference which broadly disclosed a combination of the claimed elements
 functionally cooperating in substantially the same manner to produce substantially
 the same results as that of the claimed combination. The case of *In re
 Hall,* 208 F.2d 370, 100 USPQ 46 (CCPA 1953) illustrates an
 application of this principle.
 


The court pointed out in *In re Bernhart,* 417
 F.2d 1395, 163 USPQ 611 (CCPA 1969) that the statutory language (particularly
 point out and distinctly claim) is the only proper basis for an old combination
 rejection, and in applying the rejection, that language determines what an
 applicant has a right and obligation to do. A majority opinion of the Board of
 Appeals held that Congress removed the underlying rationale of *Lincoln
 Engineering* in the 1952 Patent Act, and thereby effectively
 legislated that decision out of existence. *Ex parte Barber,* 187
 USPQ 244 (Bd. App. 1974). Finally, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
 in *Radio Steel and Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc.,* 731 F.2d
 840, 221 USPQ 657 (Fed. Cir. 1984), followed the **Bernhart** case, and ruled that a claim was not invalid under *Lincoln
 Engineering* because the claim complied with the requirements of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. Accordingly, a claim should not be
 rejected on the ground of old combination.
 


, 
# 2173.05(k) Aggregation [R-08.2012]


A claim should not be rejected on the ground of "aggregation."
 *In re Gustafson,* 331 F.2d 905, 141 USPQ 585 (CCPA 1964) (an
 applicant is entitled to know whether the claims are being rejected under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, **[102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, or
 **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**); *In re Collier,* 397 F.2d 1003, 1006,
 158 USPQ 266, 268 (CCPA 1968) ("[A] rejection for ‘aggregation’ is
 non-statutory.").
 


If a claim omits essential matter or fails to interrelate essential
 elements of the invention as defined by applicant(s) in the specification, see
 **[MPEP
 § 2172.01](s2172.html#d0e217526)**.
 



, 
# 2173.05(l) [Reserved]



, 
# 2173.05(m) Prolix [R-08.2012]


Examiners should reject claims as prolix only when they contain such
 long recitations or unimportant details that the scope of the claimed invention is
 rendered indefinite thereby. Claims are rejected as prolix when they contain long
 recitations that the metes and bounds of the claimed subject matter cannot be
 determined.
 


, 
# 2173.05(n) Multiplicity [R-11.2013]



#### *37 CFR 1.75  Claim(s).*


* (a) The specification must conclude with a claim particularly
 pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant
 regards as his invention or discovery.
* (b) More than one claim may be presented provided they differ
 substantially from each other and are not unduly multiplied.


\*\*\*\*\*



Where, in view of the nature and scope of applicant’s invention,
 applicant presents an unreasonable number of claims which are repetitious and
 multiplied, the net result of which is to confuse rather than to clarify, a rejection
 on undue multiplicity based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, may be appropriate. As noted by
 the court in *In re Chandler,* 319 F.2d 211, 225, 138 USPQ 138, 148
 (CCPA 1963), "applicants should be allowed reasonable latitude in stating their
 claims in regard to number and phraseology employed. The right of applicants to
 freedom of choice in selecting phraseology which truly points out and defines their
 inventions should not be abridged. Such latitude, however, should not be extended to
 sanction that degree of repetition and multiplicity which beclouds definition in a
 maze of confusion. The rule of reason should be practiced and applied on the basis of
 the relevant facts and circumstances in each individual case." See also *In
 re Flint,* 411 F.2d 1353, 1357, 162 USPQ 228, 231 (CCPA 1969). Undue
 multiplicity rejections based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be applied judiciously and
 should be rare. 
 


If an undue multiplicity rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, is appropriate, the examiner should contact applicant by telephone
 explaining that the claims are unduly multiplied and will be rejected under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. Note **[MPEP §
 408](s408.html#d0e22768)**. The examiner should also request that applicant select
 a specified number of claims for purpose of examination. If applicant is willing to
 select, by telephone, the claims for examination, an undue multiplicity rejection on
 all the claims based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be made in the next Office
 action along with an action on the merits on the selected claims. If applicant
 refuses to comply with the telephone request, an undue multiplicity rejection of all
 the claims based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, should be made in the next Office
 action. Applicant’s reply must include a selection of claims for purpose of
 examination, the number of which may not be greater than the number specified by the
 examiner. In response to applicant’s reply, if the examiner adheres to the undue
 multiplicity rejection, it should be repeated and the selected claims will be
 examined on the merits. This procedure preserves applicant’s right to have the
 rejection on undue multiplicity reviewed by the Patent Trail and Appeal Board. 
 


Also, it is possible to reject one claim over an allowed claim if
 they differ only by subject matter old in the art. This ground of rejection is set
 forth in *Ex parte**Whitelaw,* 1915 C.D. 18, 219 O.G. 1237 (Comm’r Pat. 1914). The
 *Ex parte**Whitelaw* doctrine is restricted to cases where the claims are
 unduly multiplied or are substantial duplicates. *Ex parte Kochan,*
 131 USPQ 204, 206 (Bd. App. 1961).
 


, 
# 2173.05(o) Double Inclusion [R-08.2012]


There is no *per se* rule that "double inclusion"
 is improper in a claim. *In re Kelly,* 305 F.2d 909, 916, 134 USPQ
 397, 402 (CCPA 1962) ("Automatic reliance upon a ‘rule against double inclusion’ will
 lead to as many unreasonable interpretations as will automatic reliance upon a ‘rule
 allowing double inclusion’. The governing consideration is not *double
 inclusion,* but rather is what is a reasonable construction of the
 language of the claims."). Older cases, such as *Ex parte White,*
 127 USPQ 261 (Bd. App. 1958) and *Ex parte Clark,* 174 USPQ 40 (Bd.
 App. 1971) should be applied with care, according to the facts of each case.
 


The facts in each case must be evaluated to determine whether or not
 the multiple inclusion of one or more elements in a claim gives rise to
 indefiniteness in that claim. The mere fact that a compound may be embraced by more
 than one member of a Markush group recited in the claim does not lead to any
 uncertainty as to the scope of that claim for either examination or infringement
 purposes. On the other hand, where a claim directed to a device can be read to
 include the same element twice, the claim may be indefinite. *Ex parte
 Kristensen,* 10 USPQ2d 1701 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).

# 2173.05(p) Claim Directed to Product-By- Process or Product and
 Process [R-10.2019]


There are many situations where claims are permissively drafted to
 include a reference to more than one statutory class of invention. 
 

**I.** **PRODUCT-BY-PROCESS**A product-by-process claim, which is a product claim that defines
 the claimed product in terms of the process by which it is made, is
 proper.*Purdue Pharma v. Epic Pharma,* 811 F.3d 1345, 1354,
 117 USPQ2d 1733, 1739 (Fed. Cir. 2016); *In re Luck,* 476 F.2d
 650, 177 USPQ 523 (CCPA 1973); *In re Pilkington,* 411 F.2d 1345,
 162 USPQ 145 (CCPA 1969); and *In re Steppan,* 394 F.2d 1013, 156
 USPQ 143 (CCPA 1967). A claim to a device, apparatus, manufacture, or composition
 of matter may contain a reference to the process in which it is intended to be
 used without being objectionable under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, so long as it is clear that the claim is directed to the product and
 not the process.
 


An applicant may present claims of varying scope even if it is
 necessary to describe the claimed product in product-by-process terms. *Ex
 parte**Pantzer,* 176 USPQ 141 (Bd. App. 1972).
 

**II.** **PRODUCT AND PROCESS IN THE SAME CLAIM**A single claim which claims both an apparatus and the method
 steps of using the apparatus is indefinite under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. See *In re Katz Interactive Call Processing Patent
 Litigation,* 639 F.3d 1303, 1318, 97 USPQ2d 1737, 1748-49 (Fed. Cir.
 2011). In *Katz,* a claim directed to "[a] system with an
 interface means for providing automated voice messages…to certain of said
 individual callers, *wherein said certain of said individual callers
 digitally enter data*" was determined to be indefinite because the
 italicized claim limitation is not directed to the system, but rather to actions
 of the individual callers, which creates confusion as to when direct infringement
 occurs. *Katz,* 639 F.3d at 1318 (citing *IPXL Holdings
 v. Amazon.com, Inc.,* 430 F.3d 1377, 1384, 77 USPQ2d 1140, 1145 (Fed.
 Cir. 2005), in which a system claim that recited "an input means" and required a
 user to use the input means was found to be indefinite because it was unclear
 "whether infringement … occurs when one creates a system that allows the user [to
 use the input means], or whether infringement occurs when the user actually uses
 the input means."); *Ex parte**Lyell,* 17 USPQ2d 1548 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990) (claim
 directed to an automatic transmission workstand and the method of using it held
 ambiguous and properly rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph).
 


In contrast, when a claim recites a product and
 additional limitations which focus on the capabilities of the system, not the
 specific actions or functions performed by the user, the claim may be definite
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. See *Mastermine Software, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,*
 874 F.3d 1307, 124 USPQ2d 1618 (Fed. Cir. 2017). 
 


, 
# 2173.05(q) "Use" Claims [R-10.2019]


Attempts to claim a process without setting forth any steps involved
 in the process generally raises an issue of indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. For example, a claim which read: "[a] process for using monoclonal
 antibodies of claim 4 to isolate and purify human fibroblast interferon" was held to
 be indefinite because it merely recites a use without any active, positive steps
 delimiting how this use is actually practiced. *Ex parte**Erlich,* 3 USPQ2d 1011 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986). 
 


"Use" claims that do not purport to claim a process, machine,
 manufacture, or composition of matter fail to comply with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 *In re Moreton,* 288 F.2d 708, 709, 129 USPQ 227, 228 (CCPA
 1961)("one cannot claim a new use per se, because it is not among the categories of
 patentable inventions specified in **[35 U.S.C. § 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**"). In *Ex
 parte**Dunki,* 153 USPQ 678 (Bd. App. 1967), the Board held the following
 claim to be an improper definition of a process: "The use of a high carbon austenitic
 iron alloy having a proportion of free carbon as a vehicle brake part subject to
 stress by sliding friction." In *Clinical Products Ltd. v. Brenner,*
 255 F. Supp. 131, 149 USPQ 475 (D.D.C. 1966), the district court held the following
 claim was definite, but that it was not a proper process claim under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**: "The use of a sustained release therapeutic agent in the
 body of ephedrine absorbed upon polystyrene sulfonic acid." 
 


Although a claim should be interpreted in light of the specification
 disclosure, it is generally considered improper to read limitations contained in the
 specification into the claims. See *In re**Prater,* 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (CCPA 1969) and *In re
 Winkhaus,* 527 F.2d 637, 188 USPQ 129 (CCPA 1975), which discuss the
 premise that one cannot rely on the specification to impart limitations to the claim
 that are not recited in the claim. 
 

**I.** **A "USE" CLAIM MAY BE REJECTED UNDER 35 U.S.C 101 AND/OR 112**It is appropriate to reject a claim that recites a use but fails
 to recite steps under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** if the facts support both rejections. For
 failure to recite a claim within one of the statutory classes under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, the appropriate form paragraph is
 **[7.05.01](#fp7.05.01)**. For indefiniteness under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**, the appropriate form paragraph is
 **[7.34.01](#fp7.34.01)**.
 

**II.** **BOARD HELD STEP OF "UTILIZING" WAS NOT INDEFINITE**It is often difficult to draw a fine line between what is
 permissible, and what is objectionable from the perspective of whether a claim is
 definite. In the case of *Ex parte**Porter,* 25 USPQ2d 1144 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992), the
 Board held that a claim which clearly recited the step of "utilizing" was not
 indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. (Claim was to "A method
 for unloading nonpacked, nonbridging and packed, bridging flowable particle
 catalyst and bead material from the opened end of a reactor tube which comprises
 utilizing the nozzle of claim 7.").
 


, 
# 2173.05(r) Omnibus Claim [R-10.2019]


Some applications are filed with an omnibus claim which reads as
 follows: A device substantially as shown and described. This claim should be rejected
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, because it is indefinite in that it fails to point out what is included or
 excluded by the claim language. See *Ex parte**Fressola,* 27 USPQ2d 1608 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993), for a
 discussion of the history of omnibus claims and an explanation of why omnibus claims
 do not comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph.
 


Such a claim can be rejected using form paragraph
 **[7.35](#fp7.35)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2175](s2175.html#ch2100_d2c184_13a97_15)**. 
 


, 
# 2173.05(s) Reference to Figures or Tables [R-10.2019]


Where possible, claims are to be complete in themselves.
 Incorporation by reference to a specific figure or table "is permitted only in
 exceptional circumstances where there is no practical way to define the invention in
 words and where it is more concise to incorporate by reference than duplicating a
 drawing or table into the claim. Incorporation by reference is a necessity doctrine,
 not for applicant’s convenience." *Ex parte**Fressola,* 27 USPQ2d 1608, 1609 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993)
 (citations omitted). 
 


Reference characters corresponding to elements recited in the
 detailed description and the drawings may be used in conjunction with the recitation
 of the same element or group of elements in the claims. Generally, the presence or
 absence of such reference characters does not affect the scope of a claim. See
 **[MPEP §
 608.01(m)](s608.html#d0e45061)** for information pertaining to the treatment of
 reference characters in a claim.
 


, 
# 2173.05(t) Chemical Formula [R-11.2013]


Claims to chemical compounds and compositions containing chemical
 compounds often use formulas that depict the chemical structure of the compound.
 These structures should not be considered indefinite nor speculative in the absence
 of evidence that the assigned formula is in error. The absence of corroborating
 spectroscopic or other data cannot be the basis for finding the structure indefinite.
 See *Ex parte**Morton,* 134 USPQ 407 (Bd. App. 1961), and *Ex
 parte**Sobin,* 139 USPQ 528 (Bd. App. 1962). 
 


A claim to a chemical compound is not indefinite merely because a
 structure is not presented or because a partial structure is presented. For example,
 the claim language at issue in *In re**Fisher,* 427 F.2d 833, 166 USPQ 18 (CCPA 1970) referred to a
 chemical compound as a "polypeptide of at least 24 amino acids having the following
 sequence." A rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, for failure to identify the entire structure was reversed and the court
 held: "While the absence of such a limitation obviously broadens the claim and raises
 questions of sufficiency of disclosure, it does not render the claim indefinite."
 Chemical compounds may be claimed by a name that adequately describes the material to
 one skilled in the art. See *Martin**v.**Johnson,* 454 F.2d 746, 172 USPQ 391 (CCPA 1972). A compound of
 unknown structure may be claimed by a combination of physical and chemical
 characteristics. See *Ex parte**Brian,* 118 USPQ 242 (Bd. App. 1958). A compound may also be
 claimed in terms of the process by which it is made without raising an issue of
 indefiniteness. 
 


, 
# 2173.05(u) Trademarks or Trade Names in a Claim [R-11.2013]


The presence of a trademark or trade name in a claim is not,
 *per se,* improper under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, but the claim should be carefully analyzed to determine how the mark or
 name is used in the claim. It is important to recognize that a trademark or trade
 name is used to identify a source of goods, and not the goods themselves. Thus a
 trademark or trade name does not identify or describe the goods associated with the
 trademark or trade name. See definitions of trademark and trade name in
 **[MPEP §
 608.01(v)](s608.html#d0e47416)**. 
 


If the trademark or trade name is used in a claim as a limitation to
 identify or describe a particular material or product, the claim does not comply with
 the requirements of the **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. *Ex parte**Simpson,* 218 USPQ 1020 (Bd. App. 1982). The claim scope is
 uncertain since the trademark or trade name cannot be used properly to identify any
 particular material or product. In fact, the value of a trademark would be lost to
 the extent that it became descriptive of a product, rather than used as an
 identification of a source or origin of a product. Thus, the use of a trademark or
 trade name in a claim to identify or describe a material or product would not only
 render a claim indefinite, but would also constitute an improper use of the trademark
 or trade name.
 


If a trademark or trade name appears in a claim and is not intended
 as a limitation in the claim, the question of why it is in the claim should be
 addressed. If its presence in the claim causes confusion as to the scope of the
 claim, then the claim should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 


, 
# 2173.05(v) Mere Function of Machine [R-11.2013]


Process or method claims are not subject to rejection by U.S. Patent
 and Trademark Office examiners under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, solely on the ground that they
 define the inherent function of a disclosed machine or apparatus. *In
 re**Tarczy-Hornoch,* 397 F.2d 856, 158 USPQ 141 (CCPA 1968). The court
 in *Tarczy-Hornoch* held that a process claim, otherwise patentable,
 should not be rejected merely because the application of which it is a part discloses
 an apparatus which will inherently carry out the recited steps.
 


, 
# 2173.06 Practice Compact Prosecution [R-07.2015]

**I.** **INTERPRET THE CLAIM AND APPLY ART WITH AN EXPLANATION OF HOW AN INDEFINITE
 TERM IS INTERPRETED**The goal of examination is to clearly articulate any
 rejection early in the prosecution process so that the applicant has the chance to
 provide evidence of patentability and otherwise reply completely at the earliest
 opportunity. See **[MPEP §
 706](s706.html#d0e57969)**. Under the principles of compact prosecution, the
 examiner should review each claim for compliance with every statutory requirement for
 patentability in the initial review of the application and identify all of the
 applicable grounds of rejection in the first Office action to avoid unnecessary
 delays in the prosecution of the application. See **[37 CFR 1.104(a)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322138)** ("On taking up
 an application for examination or a patent in a reexamination proceeding, the
 examiner shall make a thorough study thereof and shall make a thorough investigation
 of the available prior art relating to the subject matter of the claimed invention.
 The examination shall be complete with respect both to compliance of the application
 . . . with the applicable statutes and rules and to the patentability of the
 invention as claimed, as well as with respect to matters of form, unless otherwise
 indicated."). 
 


Thus, when the examiner determines that a claim term or
 phrase renders the claim indefinite, the examiner should make a rejection based on
 indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, as well as a rejection(s) in view
 of the prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** that renders the prior art applicable based on the
 examiner’s interpretation of the claim. See *In re Packard,* 751
 F.3d 1307, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (stating that the *prima facie*
 case is appropriately used for making an indefiniteness rejection). When making a
 rejection over prior art in these circumstances, it is important that the
 **examiner state on the record how the claim term or phrase is being
 interpreted** with respect to the prior art applied in the rejection. By
 rejecting each claim on all reasonable grounds available, the examiner can avoid
 piecemeal examination. See **[MPEP § 707.07(g)](s707.html#d0e75512)** ("Piecemeal
 examination should be avoided as much as possible. The examiner ordinarily should
 reject each claim on all valid grounds available . . . ."). 
 

**II.** **PRIOR ART REJECTION OF CLAIM REJECTED AS INDEFINITE**All words in a claim must be considered in judging the patentability
 of a claim against the prior art. *In re Wilson,* 424 F.2d 1382, 165
 USPQ 494 (CCPA 1970). The fact that terms may be indefinite does not make the claim
 obvious over the prior art. When the terms of a claim are considered to be
 indefinite, at least two approaches to the examination of an indefinite claim
 relative to the prior art are possible.
 


First, where the degree of uncertainty is not great, and where the
 claim is subject to more than one interpretation and at least one interpretation
 would render the claim unpatentable over the prior art, an appropriate course of
 action would be for the examiner to enter two rejections: (A) a rejection based on
 indefiniteness under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph; and (B) a rejection over the
 prior art based on the interpretation of the claims which renders the prior art
 applicable. See, e.g., *Ex parte Ionescu,* 222 USPQ 537 (Bd. App.
 1984). When making a rejection over prior art in these circumstances, it is important
 for the examiner to point out how the claim is being interpreted. Second, where there
 is a great deal of confusion and uncertainty as to the proper interpretation of the
 limitations of a claim, it would not be proper to reject such a claim on the basis of
 prior art. As stated in *In re**Steele,* 305 F.2d 859, 134 USPQ 292 (CCPA 1962), a rejection under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should not be based on considerable speculation about the
 meaning of terms employed in a claim or assumptions that must be made as to the scope
 of the claims. 
 


The first approach is recommended from an examination standpoint
 because it avoids piecemeal examination in the event that the examiner’s
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph rejection is not affirmed, and may give
 applicant a better appreciation for relevant prior art if the claims are redrafted to
 avoid the **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph rejection.
