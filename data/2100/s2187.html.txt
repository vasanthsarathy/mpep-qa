# ¶ 7.30.05 Broadest Reasonable Interpretation under 35 U.S.C.
 112(f) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph: Use of "Means" (or "Step") in Claim
 Drafting and Rebuttable Presumptions Raised


The claims in this application are given their broadest
 reasonable interpretation using the plain meaning of the claim language in light of the
 specification as it would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The
 broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim element (also commonly referred to as a
 claim limitation) is limited by the description in the specification when
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, is invoked.
 


As explained in **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection I, claim
 limitations that meet the following three-prong test will be interpreted under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph:
 


* (A) the claim limitation uses the term "means" or "step"
 or a term used as a substitute for "means" that is a generic placeholder
 (also called a nonce term or a non-structural term having no specific
 structural meaning) for performing the claimed function;
* (B) the term "means" or "step" or the generic placeholder
 is modified by functional language, typically, but not always linked by the
 transition word "for" (e.g., "means for") or another linking word or phrase,
 such as "configured to" or "so that"; and
* (C) the term "means" or "step" or the generic placeholder
 is not modified by sufficient structure, material, or acts for performing
 the claimed function.


Use of the word "means" (or "step") in a claim with
 functional language creates a rebuttable presumption that the claim limitation is to be
 treated in accordance with **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph. The presumption that the claim
 limitation is interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, is rebutted when the claim
 limitation recites function without reciting sufficient structure, material or acts to
 entirely perform the recited function.
 


Absence of the word "means" (or "step") in a claim creates a
 rebuttable presumption that the claim limitation is not to be treated in accordance with
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. The presumption that the claim limitation is not interpreted under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, is rebutted when the claim limitation recites function without reciting
 sufficient structure, material or acts to entirely perform the recited function.
 


Claim limitations in this application that use the word
 "means" (or "step") are being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, except as otherwise indicated in an Office action. Conversely, claim
 limitations in this application that do not use the word "means" (or "step") are not
 being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, except as otherwise indicated in
 an Office action.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. Use this paragraph ONLY ONCE in a given Office
 action the first time that a claim limitation uses "means" (or "step") or
 otherwise invokes treatment under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, by using a substitute term for
 "means" that serves as a generic placeholder.
* 2. This paragraph must be preceded with form
 paragraph **[7.30.03](#fp7.30.03)** unless already cited in a
 previous Office action.
* 3. When a claim limitation is being interpreted
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph (i.e., it
 meets the three-prong test), to provide clarification the examiner may
 identify the structure, material, or act disclosed in the specification that
 supports the recited function by adding explanatory remarks after this
 paragraph.
* 4. When the presumptions raised are rebutted by the
 claim language, for example by not using "means" and failing to recite
 structure that performs the function, or by using "means" along with
 definite structure that performs the function, use form paragraph
 **[7.30.06](#fp7.30.06)** and/or
 **[7.30.07](#fp7.30.07)**.
	+ Follow this form paragraph with form paragraph
	 **[7.30.06](#fp7.30.06)** when, despite the absence
	 of the word "means," a claim limitation is interpreted under
	 **[35 U.S.C.
	 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
	 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph.
	+ Follow this form paragraph with form paragraph
	 **[7.30.07](#fp7.30.07)** when, despite the presence
	 of the word "means," a claim limitation is
	 **not** being interpreted
	 under **[35 U.S.C.
	 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
	 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph.
* 5. A claim limitation interpreted under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, that raises issues under
 **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**
 and/or **[112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first and/or second
 paragraphs, respectively, should also be addressed, as appropriate. See
 **[MPEP §
 2185](s2185.html#d0e220550)**.



# ¶ 7.30.06 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph,
 Invoked Despite Absence of "Means"


This application includes one or more claim limitations that do not use
 the word "means," but are nonetheless being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 because the claim limitation(s) uses a generic placeholder that is coupled with functional
 language without reciting sufficient structure to perform the recited function and the generic
 placeholder is not preceded by a structural modifier. Such claim limitation(s) is/are:
 **[1]** in claim **[2]**.
 


Because this/these claim limitation(s) is/are being interpreted under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 it/they is/are being interpreted to cover the corresponding structure described in the
 specification as performing the claimed function, and equivalents thereof.
 


If applicant does not intend to have this/these limitation(s) interpreted
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 applicant may: (1) amend the claim limitation(s) to avoid it/them being interpreted under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph
 (e.g., by reciting sufficient structure to perform the claimed function); or (2) present a
 sufficient showing that the claim limitation(s) recite(s) sufficient structure to perform the
 claimed function so as to avoid it/them being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. Use this paragraph ONLY ONCE in a given Office action the
 first time that a claim limitation invokes treatment under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph by using a substitute term for "means" that serves as a generic
 placeholder.
* 2. In bracket 1, identify each claim limitation, and in
 bracket 2 indicate the claim(s) in which each respective limitation appears.
* 3. This paragraph must be preceded with form paragraph
 **[7.30.05](#fp7.30.05)**
 unless already cited in a previous Office action.



# ¶ 7.30.07 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph, Not Invoked Despite Presence of "Means" or "Step"


This application includes one or more claim limitations that use
 the word "means" or "step" but are nonetheless **not** being
 interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph
 because the claim limitation(s) recite(s) sufficient structure, materials, or acts to entirely
 perform the recited function. Such claim limitation(s) is/are: **[1]** in claim
 **[2]**.
 


Because this/these claim limitation(s) is/are
 **not** being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 it/they is/are **not** being interpreted to cover only the
 corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification as performing the
 claimed function, and equivalents thereof.
 


If applicant intends to have this/these limitation(s) interpreted
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 applicant may: (1) amend the claim limitation(s) to remove the structure, materials, or acts
 that performs the claimed function; or (2) present a sufficient showing that the claim
 limitation(s) does/do not recite sufficient structure, materials, or acts to perform the
 claimed function.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. Use this paragraph ONLY ONCE in a given Office action the
 first time that a claim limitation includes the word "means" or "step" but does
 **not** invoke treatment under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph because sufficient structure, materials, or acts to perform the recited
 function are present.
* 2. In bracket 1, identify each claim limitation, and in
 bracket 2 indicate the claim(s) in which each respective limitation appears.
* 3. This paragraph must be preceded with form paragraph
 **[7.30.05](#fp7.30.05)**
 unless already cited in a previous Office action.



# ¶ 7.34.23  Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112,
 Second Paragraph: Claim Limitation is Interpreted under 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112, Sixth paragraph, but Disclosure of the Structure, Material, or Acts for Performing the
 Function Recited in a Claim Is Lacking, Insufficient, or Not Clearly Linked


Claim limitation "**[1]**" invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph.
 However, the written description fails to disclose the corresponding structure, material, or
 acts for performing the entire claimed function and to clearly link the structure, material,
 or acts to the function. **[2]** Therefore, the claim is indefinite and is rejected
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 


Applicant may:


* (a) Amend the claim so that the claim limitation will no longer be
 interpreted as a limitation under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph;
* (b) Amend the written description of the specification such that it
 expressly recites what structure, material, or acts perform the entire claimed function,
 without introducing any new matter (**[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)**); or
* (c) Amend the written description of the specification such that it
 clearly links the structure, material, or acts disclosed therein to the function recited
 in the claim, without introducing any new matter (**[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)**).


If applicant is of the opinion that the written description of the
 specification already implicitly or inherently discloses the corresponding structure,
 material, or acts and clearly links them to the function so that one of ordinary skill in the
 art would recognize what structure, material, or acts perform the claimed function, applicant
 should clarify the record by either:
 


* (a) Amending the written description of the specification such that
 it expressly recites the corresponding structure, material, or acts for performing the
 claimed function and clearly links or associates the structure, material, or acts to the
 claimed function, without introducing any new matter (**[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303192)**);
 or
* (b) Stating on the record what the corresponding structure,
 material, or acts, which are implicitly or inherently set forth in the written
 description of the specification, perform the claimed function. For more information,
 see **[37 CFR
 1.75(d)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320295)** and **[MPEP §§ 608.01(o)](s608.html#d0e46173)** and
 **[2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**.


### Examiner Note:

 * 1.  In bracket 1, recite the limitation that invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph.
* 2.  In bracket 2, explain why there is insufficient disclosure of the
 corresponding structure, material, or acts for performing the entire claimed function or
 why there is no clear linkage between the structure, material, or acts and the function.
 For example, explain that (i) the disclosure is devoid of any structure that performs
 the function in the claim, (ii) the structure described in the specification does not
 perform the entire function in the claim, or (iii) no association between the structure
 and the function can be found in the specification.
* 3.  This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraphs
 **[7.30.03.h](#fp7.30.03.h)**, **[7.30.03](#fp7.30.03)**, and
 **[7.30.05](#fp7.30.05)**
 (to set forth the claim interpretation and statutory basis for **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph), and then **[7.30.02](#fp7.30.02)** or **[7.103](#fp7.103)** and **[7.34.01](#fp7.34.01)** (to set forth the statutory basis for the
 indefiniteness rejection and identify the claim at issue) and
 **[7.30.06](#fp7.30.06)**,
 if appropriate (invoked despite the absence of means).
* 4. When a rejection is made under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, because the disclosure is inadequate to support the limitation interpreted
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, for lack of written description should also
 be considered. See **[MPEP §

Claim limitation **[1]** has been evaluated under the three-prong
 test set forth in **[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection I, but the result is inconclusive. Thus, it is
 unclear whether this limitation should be interpreted under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 because **[2]**. The boundaries of this claim limitation are ambiguous; therefore,
 the claim is indefinite and is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 second paragraph. 
 


In response to this rejection, applicant must clarify whether this
 limitation should be interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 sixth paragraph. Mere assertion regarding applicant’s intent to invoke or not invoke
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph is
 insufficient. Applicant may:
 


* (a) Amend the claim to clearly invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, by reciting "means" or a generic placeholder for means, or by reciting
 "step." The "means," generic placeholder, or "step" must be modified by functional
 language, and must not be modified by sufficient structure, material, or acts for
 performing the claimed function;
* (b) Present a sufficient showing that **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, should apply because the claim limitation recites a function to be performed
 and does not recite sufficient structure, material, or acts to perform that function;
* (c) Amend the claim to clearly avoid invoking **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, by deleting the function or by reciting sufficient structure, material or
 acts to perform the recited function; or
* (d) Present a sufficient showing that **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, does not apply because the limitation does not recite a function or does
 recite a function along with sufficient structure, material or acts to perform that
 function.


### Examiner Note:

 * 1.  This paragraph should be used after the examiner has attempted to
 perform the three-prong analysis from **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection I, and is
 unable to conclude whether the claim limitation should be treated under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, because of ambiguous words in the claim. This situation should be rare.
* 2.  In bracket 1, identify the claim and claim limitation that causes
 the claim to be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph.
* 3.  In bracket 2, identify the reason that the three-prong test was
 inclusive. The possibilities include:
	+ the term "means" or generic placeholder is modified by a
	 word, which is ambiguous regarding whether it conveys structure or function;
	+ the term "step" is modified by a word, which is ambiguous
	 regarding whether it conveys an act or a function;
	+ the claim limitation uses the word "means" or a generic
	 placeholder coupled with functional language, but it is modified by some structure or
	 material that is ambiguous regarding whether that structure or material is sufficient
	 for performing the claimed function;
	+ the claim limitation uses the word "step" coupled with
	 functional language, but it is modified by some act that is ambiguous regarding
	 whether that act is sufficient for performing the claimed function.
* 4. This form paragraph may also be used in response to an
 applicant's reply in which applicant disputes the application of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. See **[MPEP §
 707.07(a)](s707.html#d0e74584)** for guidance on when the second action may be made
 final.
* 5. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraphs
 **[7.30.03.h](#fp7.30.03.h)**, **[7.30.03](#fp7.30.03)**, and
 **[7.30.05](#fp7.30.05)**
 (to set forth the claim interpretation and statutory basis for **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph), and then **[7.30.02](#fp7.30.02)** or **[7.103](#fp7.103)** and **[7.34.01](#fp7.34.01)** (to set forth the statutory basis for the
 indefiniteness rejection).
