# 2104 Requirements of 35 U.S.C. 101 [R-10.2019]


Patents are not granted for all new and useful inventions and discoveries.
 For example, the subject matter of the invention or discovery must come within the
 boundaries set forth by **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, which permits a patent to be granted only for "any
 new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and
 useful improvement thereof."
 



#### *35 U.S.C. 101   
 Inventions patentable*


Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,
 manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may
 obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.
 



**[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** has been interpreted as imposing four requirements, which are
 described below. 
 

**I.** **DOUBLE PATENTING PROHIBITED** **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** requires that whoever
 invents or discovers an eligible invention may obtain only ONE patent therefor. Thus it
 prevents two patents issuing on the same invention to the same applicant. The "same
 invention" means that identical subject matter is being claimed. This requirement forms
 the basis for statutory double patenting rejections. If more than one patent is sought,
 a patent applicant will receive a statutory double patenting rejection for claims
 included in more than one application that are directed to the same invention. 
 


See **[MPEP § 804](s804.html#d0e98894)** for a full discussion of the
 prohibition against double patenting. Use form paragraphs **[8.30](#fp8.30)**,
 **[8.31](#fp8.31)** and **[8.32](#fp8.32)** for
 statutory double patenting rejections. 
 

**II.** **NAMING OF INVENTOR**The inventor(s) must be the applicant in an application
 filed before September 16, 2012, (except as otherwise provided in **[pre-AIA 37 CFR
 1.41(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317757)**) and the inventor or each joint inventor must be
 identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012. See
 **[MPEP §
 2109](s2109.html#ch2100_d2c183_22374_28b)** for a detailed discussion of inventorship and
 **[MPEP §
 602.01(c)](s602.html#d0e4830ss602)***et seq.* for details regarding correction of inventorship.
 


In the rare situation where it is clear the application
 does not name the correct inventorship and the applicant has not filed a request to
 correct inventorship under **[37 CFR 1.48](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317930)**, the examiner should
 reject the claims under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[115](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302875912)** for
 applications subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** (see
 **[MPEP §
 2157](s2157.html#ch2100_d20034_1bb92_e7)**) or under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** for
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** (see
 **[MPEP §
 2137](s2137.html#d0e206570)**).
 

**III.** **SUBJECT MATTER
 ELIGIBILITY**A claimed invention must be eligible for patenting. As
 explained in **[MPEP §
 2106](s2106.html#d0e197244)**, there are two criteria for determining subject matter
 eligibility: (a) first, a claimed invention must fall within one of the four statutory
 categories of invention set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, i.e., process,
 machine, manufacture, or composition of matter; and (b) second, a claimed invention must
 be directed to patent-eligible subject matter and not a judicial exception (unless the
 claim as a whole includes additional limitations amounting to significantly more than
 the exception). The judicial exceptions are subject matter which courts have found to be
 outside of, or exceptions to, the four statutory categories of invention, and are
 limited to abstract ideas, laws of nature and natural phenomena (including products of
 nature). *Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,* 573 U.S. 208, 216,
 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1980 (2014) (citing *Association for Molecular Pathology v.
 Myriad Genetics, Inc.,* 569 U.S. 66, 70, 106 USPQ2d 1972, 1979 (2013)). See
 also *Bilski v. Kappos,* 561 U.S. 593, 601, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1005-06
 (2010) (citing *Diamond v. Chakrabarty,* 447 U.S. 303, 309, 206 USPQ
 193, 197 (1980)).
 


See **[MPEP § 2106](s2106.html#d0e197244)** for a discussion of subject
 matter eligibility in general, and the analytical framework that is to be used during
 examination for evaluating whether a claim is drawn to patent-eligible subject matter,
 **[MPEP §
 2106.03](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397)** for a discussion of the statutory categories of
 invention, **[MPEP § 2106.04](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0)** for a discussion of the judicial exceptions,
 and **[MPEP §
 2106.05](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb)** for a discussion of how to evaluate claims directed to
 a judicial exception for eligibility. See **[MPEP §
 2106.07(a)(1)](s2106.html#ch2100_d2c183_20b8d_1b9)** for form paragraphs for use in rejections under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** based on a lack of subject matter eligibility. See also
 **[MPEP §
 2105](s2105.html#d0e197008)** for more information about claiming living subject
 matter, as well as the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA)'s prohibition against
 claiming human organisms.
 


Eligible subject matter is further limited by the Atomic
 Energy Act explained in **[MPEP § 2104.01](s2104.html#ch2100_d2c188_18a96_2d4)**, which prohibits patents
 granted on any invention or discovery that is useful solely in the utilization of
 special nuclear material or atomic energy in an atomic weapon.
 

**IV.** **UTILITY**A claimed invention must be useful or have a utility that
 is specific, substantial and credible.
 


A rejection on the ground of lack of utility is appropriate when (1) it
 is not apparent why the invention is "useful" because applicant has failed to identify
 any specific and substantial utility and there is no well established utility, or (2) an
 assertion of specific and substantial utility for the invention is not credible. Such a
 rejection can include the more specific grounds of inoperativeness, such as inventions
 involving perpetual motion. A rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** for lack of utility
 should not be based on grounds that the invention is frivolous,
 fraudulent or against public policy. See *Juicy Whip Inc. v. Orange Bang
 Inc.,* 185 F.3d 1364, 1367-68, 51 USPQ2d 1700, 1702-03 (Fed. Cir. 1999)
 ("[Y]ears ago courts invalidated patents on gambling devices on the ground that they
 were immoral…, but that is no longer the law…Congress never intended that the patent
 laws should displace the police powers of the States, meaning by that term those powers
 by which the health, good order, peace and general welfare of the community are
 promoted…we find no basis in section 101 to hold that inventions can be ruled
 unpatentable for lack of utility simply because they have the capacity to fool some
 members of the public.").
 


 The statutory basis for this rejection is
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. See **[MPEP § 2107](s2107.html#d0e198469)** for guidelines governing
 rejections for lack of utility. See **[MPEP §§ 2107.01](s2107.html#d0e198682)** - **[2107.03](s2107.html#d0e200058)** for legal
 precedent governing the utility requirement. See **[MPEP § 2107.02](s2107.html#d0e199419)**, subsection IV, for form
 paragraphs to be used to reject claims under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** for failure to satisfy
 the utility requirement.
 



# 2104.01 Barred by Atomic Energy Act [R-10.2019]


A limitation on what can be patented is imposed by the Atomic Energy Act
 of 1954. Section 151(a) (42 U.S.C. 2181(a)) thereof reads in part as follows:
 


No patent shall hereafter be granted for any invention or discovery
 which is useful solely in the utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy
 in an atomic weapon. 
 


The terms "atomic energy" and "special nuclear material" are defined in
 Section 11 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2014).
 


Sections 151(c) and 151(d) (42 U.S.C. 2181(c) and (d)) set up categories
 of pending applications relating to atomic energy that must be brought to the attention
 of the Department of Energy. Under **[37 CFR 1.14(d)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e314245)**, applications for
 patents which disclose or which appear to disclose, or which purport to disclose,
 inventions or discoveries relating to atomic energy are reported to the Department of
 Energy and the Department will be given access to such applications, but such reporting
 does not constitute a determination that the subject matter of each application so
 reported is in fact useful or an invention or discovery or that such application in fact
 discloses subject matter in categories specified by the Atomic Energy Act.
 


All applications received in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are
 screened by Technology Center (TC) work group 3640 personnel, under **[37 CFR 1.14(d)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e314245)**, in
 order for the Director to fulfill his or her responsibilities under section 151(d) (42
 U.S.C. 2181(d)) of the Atomic Energy Act. Papers subsequently added must be inspected
 promptly by the examiner when received to determine whether the application has been
 amended to relate to atomic energy and those so related must be promptly forwarded to
 Licensing and Review in TC work group 3640.
 


All rejections based upon sections 151(a) (42 U.S.C. 2181(a)), 152 (42
 U.S.C. 2182), and 155 (42 U.S.C. 2185) of the Atomic Energy Act must be made only by TC
 work group 3640 personnel.
