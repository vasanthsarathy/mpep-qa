# 2121 Prior Art; General Level of Operability Required to Make a
 *Prima Facie* Case [R-08.2017]

**I.** **PRIOR ART IS PRESUMED TO BE OPERABLE/ENABLING**When the reference relied on expressly anticipates or makes obvious all
 of the elements of the claimed invention, the reference is presumed to be operable. Once
 such a reference is found, the burden is on applicant to rebut the presumption of
 operability. *In re Sasse,* 629 F.2d 675, 207 USPQ 107 (CCPA 1980). See
 also **[MPEP
 § 716.07](s716.html#d0e93668)**. See also *In re Antor Media Corp.,*
 689 F.3d 1282, 103 USPQ2d 1555 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Specifically, in *In re Antor
 Media Corp.,* the court stated:
 




> 
> "Consistent with the statutory framework and our
>  precedent, we therefore hold that, during patent prosecution, an examiner is
>  entitled to reject claims as anticipated by a prior art publication or patent
>  without conducting an inquiry into whether or not that prior art reference is
>  enabling. As long as an examiner makes a proper prima facie case of anticipation
>  by giving adequate notice under **[§ 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)**, the burden shifts to
>  the applicant to submit rebuttal evidence of nonenablement." 
>  
> 
> 
> 



*In re Antor Media Corp.,* 689 F.3d at
 1289, 103 USPQ2d at 1559.
 


Where a reference appears to not be enabling on its
 face, however, an applicant may successfully challenge the cited prior art for lack of
 enablement by argument without supporting evidence. *In re Morsa,* 713
 F.3d 104, 110, 106 USPQ2d 1327, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2013).
 


See also **[MPEP § 716.07](s716.html#d0e93668)**.
 

**II.** **WHAT CONSTITUTES AN "ENABLING DISCLOSURE" DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF PRIOR
 ART THE DISCLOSURE IS CONTAINED IN**The level of disclosure required within a reference to make it an
 "enabling disclosure" is the same no matter what type of prior art is at issue. It does
 not matter whether the prior art reference is a U.S. patent, foreign patent, a printed
 publication or other. There is no basis in the statute (**[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**) for discriminating either in favor of or against prior art
 references on the basis of nationality. *In re Moreton,* 288 F.2d 708,
 129 USPQ 227 (CCPA 1961).
 

**III.** **EFFICACY IS NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR PRIOR ART ENABLEMENT** A prior art reference provides an enabling disclosure and thus
 anticipates a claimed invention if the reference describes the claimed invention in
 sufficient detail to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to carry out the
 claimed invention; 
 "proof of efficacy is not
 required for a prior art reference to be enabling for purposes of
 anticipation."
 
 
 *Impax Labs. Inc. v. Aventis Pharm.**Inc.,* 468 F.3d 1366, 1383, 81 USPQ2d 1001, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2006). See
 also **[MPEP §
 2122](s2122.html#d0e201997)**. 
 



# 2121.01 Use of Prior Art in Rejections Where Operability is in
 Question [R-10.2019]


"In determining that quantum of prior art disclosure which is necessary
 to declare an applicant’s invention ‘not novel’ or ‘anticipated’ within
 **[section
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, the stated test is whether a reference contains an ‘enabling
 disclosure’... ." *In re**Hoeksema,* 399 F.2d 269, 158 USPQ 596 (CCPA 1968). The disclosure in
 an assertedly anticipating reference must provide an enabling disclosure of the desired
 subject matter; mere naming or description of the subject matter is insufficient, if it
 cannot be produced without undue experimentation. *Elan Pharm., Inc. v. Mayo
 Found. For Med. Educ. & Research,* 346 F.3d 1051, 1054, 68 USPQ2d 1373,
 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (At issue was whether a prior art reference enabled one of
 ordinary skill in the art to produce Elan’s claimed transgenic mouse without undue
 experimentation. Without a disclosure enabling one skilled in the art to produce a
 transgenic mouse without undue experimentation, the reference would not be applicable as
 prior art.). A reference contains an "enabling disclosure" if the public was in
 possession of the claimed invention before the effective filing date of the claimed
 invention for applications or patents subject to the first inventor to file provisions
 of the AIA or the time the invention was made for applications or patents subject to
 pre-AIA law. "Such possession is effected if one of ordinary skill in the art could have
 combined the publication’s description of the invention with his [or her] own knowledge
 to make the claimed invention." *In re Donohue,* 766 F.2d 531, 226 USPQ
 619 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 

**I.** **35 U.S.C. 102 REJECTIONS AND ADDITION OF EVIDENCE SHOWING REFERENCE IS
 OPERABLE**It is possible to make a **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** rejection even if
 the reference does not itself teach one of ordinary skill how to practice the
 invention, i.e., how to make the article disclosed or use the method disclosed. If
 the reference teaches every claimed element of the article or every claimed step of
 the method, secondary evidence, such as other patents or publications, can be cited
 to show public possession of the method of making the article or using the method.
 *In re Donohue,* 766 F.2d at 533, 226 USPQ at 621. See
 **[MPEP §
 2131.01](s2131.html#d0e203057)** for more information on **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 rejections using secondary references to show that the primary reference contains an
 "enabling disclosure." 
 

**II.** **35 U.S.C. 103 REJECTIONS AND USE OF INOPERATIVE PRIOR ART**"Even if a reference discloses an inoperative device, it is prior
 art for all that it teaches." *Beckman Instruments**v.**LKB Produkter AB,* 892 F.2d 1547, 1551, 13 USPQ2d 1301, 1304 (Fed.
 Cir. 1989). Therefore, "a non-enabling reference may qualify as prior art for the
 purpose of determining obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**." *Symbol
 Techs. Inc. v. Opticon Inc.,* 935 F.2d 1569, 1578, 19 USPQ2d 1241, 1247
 (Fed. Cir. 1991).
 




# 2121.02 Compounds and Compositions — What Constitutes Enabling Prior
 Art [R-08.2017]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the
 relevant date is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the
 "time of the invention" or "date of invention," which are only applicable to
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See
 **[35
 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*

**I.** **ONE OF ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART MUST BE ABLE TO MAKE OR SYNTHESIZE**Where a process for making the compound is not developed until after
 the date of invention, the mere naming of a compound in a reference, without more,
 cannot constitute a description of the compound. *In re Hoeksema,*
 399 F.2d 269, 158 USPQ 596 (CCPA 1968). Note, however, that a reference is presumed
 operable until applicant provides facts rebutting the presumption of operability.
 *In re Sasse,* 629 F.2d 675, 207 USPQ 107 (CCPA 1980). Therefore,
 applicant must provide evidence showing that a process for making was not known at
 the time of the invention. See the following subsection for the evidentiary standard
 to be applied. 
 

**II.** **A REFERENCE DOES NOT CONTAIN AN "ENABLING DISCLOSURE" IF ATTEMPTS AT MAKING
 THE COMPOUND OR COMPOSITION WERE UNSUCCESSFUL BEFORE THE DATE OF INVENTION**When a prior art reference merely discloses the structure of the
 claimed compound, evidence showing that attempts to prepare that compound were
 unsuccessful before the date of invention will be adequate to show inoperability.
 *In re Wiggins,* 488 F.2d 538, 179 USPQ 421 (CCPA 1973). However,
 the fact that an author of a publication did not attempt to make the compound
 disclosed, without more, will not overcome a rejection based on that publication.
 *In re Donohue,* 766 F.2d 531, 226 USPQ 619 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (In
 this case, the examiner had made a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** over a publication, which disclosed the claimed
 compound, in combination with two patents teaching a general process of making the
 particular class of compounds. The applicant submitted an affidavit stating that the
 authors of the publication had not actually synthesized the compound. The court held
 that the fact that the publication’s author did not synthesize the disclosed compound
 was immaterial to the question of reference operability. The patents were evidence
 that synthesis methods were well known. The court distinguished
 *Wiggins,* in which a very similar rejection was reversed. In
 *Wiggins,* attempts to make the compounds using the prior art
 methods were all unsuccessful.). Compare *In re Hoeksema,* 399 F.2d
 269, 158 USPQ 596 (CCPA 1968) (A claim to a compound was rejected over a patent to
 *De Boer* which disclosed compounds similar in structure to those
 claimed (obvious homologs) and a process of making these compounds. Applicant
 responded with an affidavit by an expert named Wiley which stated that there was no
 indication in the *De Boer* patent that the process disclosed in
 *De Boer* could be used to produce the claimed compound and that
 he did not believe that the process disclosed in *De Boer* could be
 adapted to the production of the claimed compound. The court held that the facts
 stated in this affidavit were legally sufficient to overcome the rejection and that
 applicant need not show that all known processes are incapable of producing the
 claimed compound for this showing would be practically impossible.). 
 




# 2121.03 Plant Genetics — What Constitutes Enabling Prior
 Art [R-10.2019]

**THOSE OF ORDINARY SKILL MUST BE ABLE TO GROW AND CULTIVATE THE PLANT**When the claims are drawn to plants, the reference, combined with
 knowledge in the prior art, must enable one of ordinary skill in the art to reproduce
 the plant. *In re**LeGrice,* 301 F.2d 929, 133 USPQ 365 (CCPA 1962) (National Rose
 Society Annual of England and various other catalogues showed color pictures of the
 claimed roses and disclosed that applicant had raised the roses. The publications
 were published more than 1 year before applicant's filing date. The court held that
 the publications did not place the rose in the public domain. Information on the
 grafting process required to reproduce the rose was not included in the publications
 and such information was necessary for those of ordinary skill in the art (plant
 breeders) to reproduce the rose.). Compare *Ex parte**Thomson,* 24 USPQ2d 1618 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (Seeds
 were commercially available more than 1 year prior to applicant’s filing date. One of
 ordinary skill in the art could grow the claimed cotton cultivar from the
 commercially available seeds. Thus, the publications describing the cotton cultivar
 had "enabled disclosures." The Board distinguished *In re LeGrice*
 by finding that the catalogue picture of the rose of *In re LeGrice*
 was the only evidence in that case. There was no evidence of commercial availability
 in enabling form since the asexually reproduced rose could not be reproduced from
 seed. Therefore, the public would not have possession of the rose by its picture
 alone, but the public would have possession of the cotton cultivar based on the
 publications and the availability of the seeds.). In *In re Elsner,*
 381 F.3d 1125, 1126, 72 USPQ2d 1038, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 2004), prior to the critical
 date of a plant patent application, the plant had been sold in Germany and a foreign
 Plant Breeder’s Rights (PBR) application for the same plant had been published in the
 Community Plant Variety Office *Official Gazette*. The court held
 that when (i) a publication identifies claimed the plant, (ii) a foreign sale occurs
 that puts one of ordinary skill in the art in possession of the plant itself, and
 (iii) such possession permits asexual reproduction of the plant without undue
 experimentation to one of ordinary skill in the art, then that combination of facts
 and events directly conveys the essential knowledge of the invention and constitutes
 a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** statutory bar.*Id.* at 1129, 72 USPQ2d
 at 1041. Although the court agreed with the Board that foreign sales may enable an
 otherwise non-enabling printed publication, the case was remanded for additional
 fact-finding in order to determine if the foreign sales of the plant were known to be
 accessible to the skilled artisan and if the skilled artisan could have reproduced
 the plant asexually after obtaining it without undue experimentation.
 *Id.* at 1131, 72 USPQ2d at 1043. See **[MPEP §
 2152.02(d)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_2254b_3e0)** for information on foreign sales being prior art
 for applications subject to the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA. 
 




# 2121.04 Apparatus and Articles — What Constitutes Enabling Prior
 Art [R-10.2019]

**PICTURES MAY CONSTITUTE AN "ENABLING DISCLOSURE"**Pictures and drawings may be sufficiently enabling to put the public
 in the possession of the article pictured. Therefore, such an enabling picture may
 be used to reject claims to the article. However, the picture must show all the
 claimed structural features and how they are put together. *In re
 Bager,* 47 F.2d 951, 953, 8 USPQ 484, 486 (CCPA 1931) ("Description for
 the purposes of anticipation can be by drawings alone as well as by words.") (citing
 *Jockmus v. Leviton,* 28 F.2d 812 (2d Cir. 1928)). See also
