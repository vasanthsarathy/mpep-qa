# 2135 Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **not applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as
 set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is subject to
 examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to those
 provisions.]*



#### *Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102   
 Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of right to patent.*


A person shall be entitled to a patent unless -


\*\*\*\*\*


* (d) the invention was first patented or caused to be patented, or was
 the subject of an inventor’s certificate, by the applicant or his legal
 representatives or assigns in a foreign country prior to the date of the
 application for patent in this country on an application for patent or inventor’s
 certificate filed more than twelve months before the filing of the application in
 the United States.


\*\*\*\*\*


**I.** **GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)****[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** establishes four conditions which, if all are present,
 establish a statutory bar against the granting of a patent in this country:
 


* (A) The foreign application must be filed more than 12 months before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention in the United States (see
 **[MPEP § 2139.01](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_12530_2b6)** regarding determination of the effective
 U.S. filing date when an application is subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**);
* (B) The foreign and United States applications must have been filed
 by the same applicant or by the same applicant's legal representatives or
 assigns.
* (C) The foreign application must have actually issued as a patent or
 inventor’s certificate (e.g., granted by sealing of the papers in Great Britain)
 before the filing in the United States. It need not be published but the patent
 rights granted must be enforceable.
* (D) The same invention must be involved.


If such a foreign patent or inventor’s certificate is discovered by the
 examiner, the rejection is made under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** on the
 ground of statutory bar. See **[MPEP § 2135.01](s2135.html#d0e205339)** for further
 clarification of each of the four requirements of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 

**II.** **SEARCHING FOR PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d) PRIOR ART**The examiner should undertake a search for an issued foreign patent for
 use as **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** prior art only if there is a reasonable possibility
 that a foreign patent covering the same subject matter as the U.S. application has been
 granted to the same inventive entity before the U.S. effective filing date, i.e., the
 time period between foreign and U.S. filings is greater than the usual time it takes for
 a patent to issue in the foreign country. The document must be a patent or inventor’s
 certificate and not merely a published or laid open application. Normally, the
 probability of the inventor’s foreign patent issuing before the U.S. filing date is so
 slight as to make such a search unproductive. However, it should be kept in mind that
 the average pendency varies greatly between foreign countries. 
 


The search for a granted patent can be accomplished on an electronic
 database either by the examiner or by the staff of the Scientific and Technical
 Information Center. See **[MPEP § 901.06(a)](s901.html#d0e113260)**, subsection IV.B., for more information on
 online searching. Alternatively, if the examiner has a reasonable basis for concluding
 that **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** prior art might exist, the examiner may make a requirement
 for information under **[37 CFR 1.105](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e322262)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 704.10](s704.html#d0e55758)***et seq.*



# 2135.01 The Four Requirements of Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **not applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA
 as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of applications subject to
 those provisions.]*

**I.** **FOREIGN APPLICATION MUST BE FILED MORE THAN 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE
 U.S. FILING DATE*** 

***A.******An Anniversary Date Ending on a Weekend or Holiday Results in an
 Extension to the Next Business Day***The U.S. application is filed in time to prevent a
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bar from arising if it is filed on the 1
 year anniversary date of the filing date of the foreign application. If this day
 is a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, the year would be extended to the
 following business day. See *Ex parte Olah,* 131 USPQ 41 (Bd.
 App. 1960). Despite changes to **[37 CFR 1.6(a)(2)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313465)** and
 **[37 CFR
 1.10](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313951)**, which require the USPTO to accord a filing date to an
 application as of the date of deposit as Priority Express Mail® with the U.S.
 Postal Service in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.10](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313951)** (e.g., a Saturday
 filing date), the rule changes do not affect applicant’s concurrent right to defer
 the filing of an application until the next business day when the last day for
 "taking any action" falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday (e.g., the
 last day of the 1-year grace period falls on a Saturday).
 

***B.******A Continuation-in-Part Breaks the Chain of Priority as to Foreign as
 Well as U.S. Parents***In the case where applicant files a foreign application, later
 files a U.S. application claiming priority based on the foreign application, and
 then files a continuation-in-part (CIP) application whose claims are not entitled
 to the filing date of the U.S. parent, the effective filing date is the filing
 date of the CIP and applicant cannot obtain the benefit of either the U.S. parent
 or foreign application filing dates. *In re Van Langenhoven,* 458
 F.2d 132, 137, 173 USPQ 426, 429 (CCPA 1972). If the foreign application issues
 into a patent before the filing date of the CIP, it may be used in a
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**/**[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** rejection if the subject
 matter added to the CIP does not render the claims nonobvious over the foreign
 patent. *Ex parte Appeal No. 242-47,* 196 USPQ 828 (Bd. App.
 1976) (Foreign patent can be combined with other prior art to bar a U.S. patent in
 an obviousness rejection based on **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**/**[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**).
 

**II.** **FOREIGN APPLICATION MUST HAVE BEEN FILED BY SAME APPLICANT, HIS OR HER LEGAL
 REPRESENTATIVE OR ASSIGNS**Note that where the U.S. application was made by two or more
 inventors, it is permissible for these inventors to claim priority from separate
 applications, each to one of the inventors or a subcombination of inventors. For
 instance, a U.S. application naming inventors A and B may be entitled to priority
 from one application to A and one to B filed in a foreign country.
 

**III.** **THE FOREIGN PATENT OR INVENTOR’S CERTIFICATE WAS ACTUALLY GRANTED BEFORE THE
 U.S. FILING DATE*** 

***A.******To Be "Patented" an Exclusionary Right Must Be Awarded to the
 Applicant***"Patented" means "a formal bestowal of patent rights from the
 sovereign to the applicant." *In re Monks,* 588 F.2d 308, 310,
 200 USPQ 129, 131 (CCPA 1978); *American Infra-Red Radiant Co. v. Lambert
 Indus.,* 360 F.2d 977, 149 USPQ 722 (8th Cir.), *cert.
 denied,* 385 U.S. 920 (1966) (German Gebrauchsmuster petty patent was
 held to be a patent usable in a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 rejection. A Gebrauchsmuster petty patent is not examined and, at the time of the
 decision, had only a 6-year patent term. However, except as to duration, the
 exclusionary patent right granted is as extensive as in the U.S.).
 

***B.******A Published Application Is Not a "Patent"***An application must issue into a patent before it can be applied
 in a **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** rejection. *Ex parte
 Fujishiro,* 199 USPQ 36 (Bd. App. 1977) ("Patenting," within the
 meaning of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, does not occur upon laying open
 of a Japanese utility model application (kokai or kohyo)); *Ex parte
 Links,* 184 USPQ 429 (Bd. App. 1974) (German applications, which have
 not yet been published for opposition, are published in the form of printed
 documents called Offenlegungsschriften 18 months after filing. These applications
 are unexamined or in the process of being examined at the time of publication. The
 Board held that an Offenlegungsschrift is not a patent under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** even though some provisional rights are granted. The
 Board explained that the provisional rights are minimal and do not come into force
 if the application is withdrawn or refused.).
 

***C.******An Allowed Application Can Be a "Patent" for Purposes of Pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d) as of the Date Published for Opposition Even Though It Has Not
 Yet Been Granted as a Patent***An examined application which has been allowed by the examiner
 and published to allow the public to oppose the grant of a patent has been held to
 be a "patent" for purposes of rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** as of
 the date of publication for opposition if substantial provisional enforcement
 rights arise. *Ex parte Beik,* 161 USPQ 795 (Bd. App. 1968) (This
 case dealt with examined German applications. After a determination that an
 application is allowable, the application is published in the form of a printed
 document called an Auslegeschrift. The publication begins a period of opposition
 were the public can present evidence showing unpatentability. Provisional patent
 rights are granted which are substantially the same as those available once the
 opposition period is over and the patent is granted. The Board found that an
 Auslegeschrift provides the legal effect of a patent for purposes of rejection
 under **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.).
 

***D.******Grant Occurs When Patent Becomes Enforceable***The critical date of a foreign patent as a reference under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is the date the patent becomes enforceable
 (issued, sealed or granted). *In re Monks,* 588 F.2d 308, 310,
 200 USPQ 129, 131 (CCPA 1978) (British reference became available as prior art on
 date the patent was "sealed" because as of this date applicant had the right to
 exclude others from making, using or selling the claimed invention.). 
 

***E.******Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d) Applies as of Grant Date Even If There Is a
 Period of Secrecy After Patent Grant*** A period of secrecy after granting the patent, as in Belgium and
 Spain, has been held to have no effect in connection with **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These patents are usable in rejections under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** as of the date patent rights are granted.
 *In re Kathawala,* 9 F.3d 942, 28 USPQ2d 1789 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 (An invention is "patented" for purposes of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** when
 the patentee’s rights under the patent become fixed. The fact that applicant’s
 Spanish application was not published until after the U.S. filing date is
 immaterial since the Spanish patent was granted before U.S. filing.);
 *Gramme Elec. Co. v. Arnoux and Hochhausen Elec. Co.,* 17 F.
 838, 1883 C.D. 418 (S.D.N.Y. 1883) (Rejection made under a predecessor of
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** based on an Austrian patent granted an
 exclusionary right for 1 year but was kept secret, at the option of the patentee,
 for that period. The court held that the Austrian patent grant date was the
 relevant date under the statute for purposes of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** but that the patent could not have been used to in a
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) or (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**);  *In re
 Talbott,* 443 F.2d 1397, 170 USPQ 281 (CCPA 1971) (Applicant cannot
 avoid a **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** rejection by exercising an option to keep
 the subject matter of a German Gebrauchsmuster (petty patent) in secrecy until
 time of U.S. filing.). 
 

**IV.** **THE SAME INVENTION MUST BE INVOLVED*** 

***"Same Invention" Means That the Application Claims Could Have Been
 Presented in the Foreign Patent***Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the
 "invention... patented" in the foreign country must be the same as the invention
 sought to be patented in the U.S. When the foreign patent contains the same claims
 as the U.S. application, there is no question that "the invention was first
 patented... in a foreign country." *In re Kathawala,* 9 F.3d 942,
 945, 28 USPQ2d 1785, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1993). However, the claims need not be
 identical or even within the same statutory class. If applicant is granted a
 foreign patent which fully discloses the invention and which gives applicant a
 number of different claiming options in the U.S., the reference in
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** to "‘invention... patented’ necessarily
 includes all the disclosed aspects of the invention. Thus, the [pre-AIA] section
 102(d) bar applies regardless whether the foreign patent contains claims to less
 than all aspects of the invention." 9 F.3d at 946, 28 USPQ2d at 1788. In essence,
 a **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** rejection applies if applicant’s foreign
 application supports the subject matter of the U.S. claims. *Id.*
 at 944, 947, 28 USPQ2d at 1786, 1789 (Applicant was granted a Spanish patent
 claiming a method of making a composition. The patent disclosed compounds, methods
 of use and processes of making the compounds. After the Spanish patent was
 granted, the applicant filed a U.S. application with claims directed to the
 compound but not the process of making it. The Federal Circuit held that it did
 not matter that the claims in the U.S. application were directed to the
 composition instead of the process because the foreign specification would have
 supported claims to the composition. It was immaterial that the formulations were
 unpatentable pharmaceutical compositions in Spain.).

 date the patent was "sealed" because as of this date applicant had the right to
 exclude others from making, using or selling the claimed invention.). 
 

***E.******Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d) Applies as of Grant Date Even If There Is a
 Period of Secrecy After Patent Grant*** A period of secrecy after granting the patent, as in Belgium and
 Spain, has been held to have no effect in connection with **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. These patents are usable in rejections under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** as of the date patent rights are granted.
 *In re Kathawala,* 9 F.3d 942, 28 USPQ2d 1789 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 (An invention is "patented" for purposes of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** when
 the patentee’s rights under the patent become fixed. The fact that applicant’s
 Spanish application was not published until after the U.S. filing date is
 immaterial since the Spanish patent was granted before U.S. filing.);
 *Gramme Elec. Co. v. Arnoux and Hochhausen Elec. Co.,* 17 F.
 838, 1883 C.D. 418 (S.D.N.Y. 1883) (Rejection made under a predecessor of
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** based on an Austrian patent granted an
 exclusionary right for 1 year but was kept secret, at the option of the patentee,
 for that period. The court held that the Austrian patent grant date was the
 relevant date under the statute for purposes of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** but that the patent could not have been used to in a
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) or (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**);  *In re
 Talbott,* 443 F.2d 1397, 170 USPQ 281 (CCPA 1971) (Applicant cannot
 avoid a **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** rejection by exercising an option to keep
 the subject matter of a German Gebrauchsmuster (petty patent) in secrecy until
 time of U.S. filing.). 
 

**IV.** **THE SAME INVENTION MUST BE INVOLVED*** 

***"Same Invention" Means That the Application Claims Could Have Been
 Presented in the Foreign Patent***Under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the
 "invention... patented" in the foreign country must be the same as the invention
 sought to be patented in the U.S. When the foreign patent contains the same claims
 as the U.S. application, there is no question that "the invention was first
 patented... in a foreign country." *In re Kathawala,* 9 F.3d 942,
 945, 28 USPQ2d 1785, 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1993). However, the claims need not be
 identical or even within the same statutory class. If applicant is granted a
 foreign patent which fully discloses the invention and which gives applicant a
 number of different claiming options in the U.S., the reference in
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** to "‘invention... patented’ necessarily
 includes all the disclosed aspects of the invention. Thus, the [pre-AIA] section
 102(d) bar applies regardless whether the foreign patent contains claims to less
 than all aspects of the invention." 9 F.3d at 946, 28 USPQ2d at 1788. In essence,
 a **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** rejection applies if applicant’s foreign
 application supports the subject matter of the U.S. claims. *Id.*
 at 944, 947, 28 USPQ2d at 1786, 1789 (Applicant was granted a Spanish patent
 claiming a method of making a composition. The patent disclosed compounds, methods
 of use and processes of making the compounds. After the Spanish patent was
 granted, the applicant filed a U.S. application with claims directed to the
 compound but not the process of making it. The Federal Circuit held that it did
 not matter that the claims in the U.S. application were directed to the
 composition instead of the process because the foreign specification would have
 supported claims to the composition. It was immaterial that the formulations were
 unpatentable pharmaceutical compositions in Spain.).
