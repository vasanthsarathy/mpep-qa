# 2114 Apparatus and Article Claims — Functional Language [R-07.2015]


For a discussion of case law which provides guidance in interpreting the
 functional portion of means-plus-function limitations see **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)** -
 **[§
 2186](s2186.html#d0e220631)**.
 

**I.** **INHERENCY AND FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS IN APPARATUS CLAIMS**Features of an apparatus may be recited either structurally or
 functionally. *In re Schreiber,* 128 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429,
 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1997). See also **[MPEP § 2173.05(g)](s2173.html#d0e218409)**. If an examiner
 concludes that a functional limitation is an inherent characteristic of the prior art,
 then to establish a prima case of anticipation or obviousness, the examiner should
 explain that the prior art structure inherently possesses the functionally defined
 limitations of the claimed apparatus. *In re Schreiber,* 128 F.3d at
 1478, 44 USPQ2d at 1432. See also *Bettcher Industries, Inc. v. Bunzl USA,
 Inc.,* 661 F.3d 629, 639-40,100 USPQ2d 1433, 1440 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The
 burden then shifts to applicant to establish that the prior art does not possess the
 characteristic relied on. *In re Schreiber,* 128 F.3d at 1478, 44
 USPQ2d at 1432; *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 213, 169 USPQ 226, 228
 (CCPA 1971) ("where the Patent Office has reason to believe that a functional limitation
 asserted to be critical for establishing novelty in the claimed subject matter may, in
 fact, be an inherent characteristic of the prior art, it possesses the authority to
 require the applicant to prove that the subject matter shown to be in the prior art does
 not possess the characteristic relied on").
 

**II.** **MANNER OF OPERATING THE DEVICE DOES NOT DIFFERENTIATE APPARATUS CLAIM FROM THE
 PRIOR ART**"[A]pparatus claims cover what a device *is,* not what
 a device *does*." *Hewlett-Packard Co.**v.**Bausch & Lomb Inc.,* 909 F.2d 1464, 1469, 15 USPQ2d 1525, 1528
 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (emphasis in original). A claim containing a "recitation with respect
 to the manner in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not
 differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus" if the prior art
 apparatus teaches all the structural limitations of the claim.
 *Ex parte Masham,* 2 USPQ2d 1647 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987)
 (The preamble of claim 1 recited that the apparatus was "for mixing flowing developer
 material" and the body of the claim recited "means for mixing ..., said mixing means
 being stationary and completely submerged in the developer material." The claim was
 rejected over a reference which taught all the structural limitations of the claim for
 the intended use of mixing flowing developer. However, the mixer was only partially
 submerged in the developer material. The Board held that the amount of submersion is
 immaterial to the structure of the mixer and thus the claim was properly rejected.).
 
 

**III.** **A PRIOR ART DEVICE CAN PERFORM ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF THE APPARATUS CLAIM AND STILL
 NOT ANTICIPATE THE CLAIM**Even if the prior art device performs all the functions recited in the
 claim, the prior art cannot anticipate the claim if there is any structural difference.
 It should be noted, however, that means-plus-function limitations are met by structures
 which are equivalent to the corresponding structures recited in the specification.
 *In re Donaldson,* 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed.
 Cir. 1994). See also *In re Robertson,* 169 F.3d 743, 745, 49 USPQ2d
 1949, 1951 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (The claims were drawn to a disposable diaper having three
 fastening elements. The reference disclosed two fastening elements that could perform
 the same function as the three fastening elements in the claims. The court construed the
 claims to require three separate elements and held that the reference did not disclose a
 separate third fastening element, either expressly or inherently.).
 

**IV.** **DETERMINING WHETHER A COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONAL CLAIM LIMITATION IS
 PATENTABLE OVER THE PRIOR ART UNDER 35 U.S.C. 102 AND 103**Functional claim language that is not limited to a
 specific structure covers all devices that are capable of performing the recited
 function. Therefore, if the prior art discloses a device that can inherently perform the
 claimed function, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and/or
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** may be appropriate. See *In re Translogic Technology,
 Inc.,* 504 F.3d 1249, 1258, 84 USPQ2d 1929, 1935-1936 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (The
 claims were drawn to multiplexer circuit. The patent at issue claimed "coupled to" and
 "coupled to receive" between various portions of the circuitry. In reference to the
 claim phrase "input terminals ‘coupled to receive’ first and second input variables,"
 the court held that "the claimed circuit does not require any specific input or
 connection … [a]s such, ‘coupled to’ and ‘coupled to receive’ are clearly different …
 [a]s shown in [the figures of the] patent, input terminals … only need to be ‘capable of
 receiving’ an input variable for the multiplexer circuit as claimed". Therefore, the
 specification supported the claim construction "that ‘coupled to receive’ means ‘capable
 of receiving.’"); *Intel Corp. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm’n,* 946 F.2d
 821, 832, 20 USPQ2d 1161, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (The court held that "programmable"
 claim language required only that the accused product could be programmed to perform the
 claimed functionality.);*In re Schreiber,* 128 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44
 USPQ2d 1429, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *In re Best,* 562 F.2d 1252, 1254,
 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977); *In re Ludtke,* 441 F.2d 660, 663-64,
 169 USPQ 563, 566-67 (CCPA 1971); *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210,
 212-13, 169 USPQ 226, 228-29 (CCPA 1971) ("[I]t is elementary that the mere recitation
 of a newly discovered function or property, inherently possessed by things in the prior
 art, does not cause a claim drawn to those things to distinguish over the prior art").
 See **[MPEP §
 2112](s2112.html#d0e201036)** for more information. 
 


Conversely, computer-implemented functional claim
 limitations may narrow the functionality of the device, by limiting the specific
 structure capable of performing the recited function. *Nazomi Communications,
 Inc. v. Nokia Corp.,* 739 F.3d 1339, 1345, 109 USPQ2d 1258, 1262 (Fed Cir.
 2014) (The claims were drawn to a CPU that can perform processing of both register-based
 and stack-based instructions. Appellant alleged infringement of the claims based on
 claim construction requiring only hardware capable of performing the claimed
 functionalities. Contrasted with the finding of *Intel Corp. v. U.S. Int'l Trade
 Comm’n,* 846 F.2d 821, 832, 20 USPQ2d 1161, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the court
 found that "[s]ince hardware cannot meet these limitations in the absence of enabling
 software, the claims are properly construed as claiming an apparatus comprising a
 combination of hardware and software capable of practicing the claim limitations."). 
 


Computer-implemented functional claim limitations may
 also be broad because the term "computer" is commonly understood by one of ordinary
 skill in the art to describe a variety of devices with varying degrees of complexity and
 capabilities. *In re Paulsen,* 30 F.3d 1475, 1479-80, 31 USPQ2d 1671,
 1674 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Therefore, a claim containing the term "computer" should not be
 construed as limited to a computer having a specific set of characteristics and
 capabilities, unless the term is modified by other claim terms or clearly defined in the
 specification to be different from its common meaning. *Id.* In
 *Paulsen,* the claims, directed to a portable computer, were
 rejected as anticipated under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** by a reference that
 disclosed a calculator, because the term "computer" was given the broadest reasonable
 interpretation consistent with the specification to include a calculator, and a
 calculator was considered to be a particular type of computer by those of ordinary skill
 in the art. *Id.*


When determining whether a computer-implemented
 functional claim would have been obvious, examiners should note that broadly claiming an
 automated means to replace a manual function to accomplish the same result does not
 distinguish over the prior art. See *Leapfrog Enters., Inc. v. Fisher-Price,
 Inc.,* 485 F.3d 1157, 1161, 82 USPQ2d 1687, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2007)
 ("Accommodating a prior art mechanical device that accomplishes [a desired] goal to
 modern electronics would have been reasonably obvious to one of ordinary skill in
 designing children’s learning devices. Applying modern electronics to older mechanical
 devices has been commonplace in recent years."); *In re Venner,* 262
 F.2d 91, 95, 120 USPQ 193, 194 (CCPA 1958); see also **[MPEP § 2144.04](s2144.html#d0e210929)**.
 Furthermore, implementing a known function on a computer has been deemed obvious to one
 of ordinary skill in the art if the automation of the known function on a general
 purpose computer is nothing more than the predictable use of prior art elements
 according to their established functions. *KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex
 Inc.,* 550 U.S. 398, 417, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1396 (2007); see also
 **[MPEP §
 2143](s2143.html#d0e209516)**, Exemplary Rationales D and F. Likewise, it has been
 found to be obvious to adapt an existing process to incorporate Internet and Web browser
 technologies for communicating and displaying information because these technologies had
 become commonplace for those functions. *Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson
 Corp.,* 532 F.3d 1318, 1326-27, 87 USPQ2d 1350, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2008).
