# 2163 Guidelines for the Examination of Patent Applications Under the 35
 U.S.C. 112(a) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, "Written Description"
 Requirement [R-10.2019]


The following Guidelines establish the policies and procedures to be
 followed by Office personnel in the evaluation of any patent application for compliance
 with the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**. These Guidelines are
 based on the Office’s current understanding of the law and are believed to be fully
 consistent with binding precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as the U.S. Court of
 Appeals for the Federal Circuit and its predecessor courts. 
 


The Guidelines do not constitute substantive rulemaking and hence do not
 have the force and effect of law. They are designed to assist Office personnel in analyzing
 claimed subject matter for compliance with substantive law. Rejections will be based upon
 the substantive law, and it is these rejections that are appealable. Consequently, any
 perceived failure by Office personnel to follow these Guidelines is neither appealable nor
 petitionable.
 


These Guidelines are intended to form part of the normal examination
 process. Thus, where Office personnel establish a *prima facie* case of
 lack of written description for a claim, a thorough review of the prior art and examination
 on the merits for compliance with the other statutory requirements, including those of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, **[102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, and
 **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, is to be conducted prior to completing an Office action that
 includes a rejection for lack of written description. 
 

**I.** **GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING COMPLIANCE WITH THE "WRITTEN DESCRIPTION"
 REQUIREMENT FOR APPLICATIONS****[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and the first paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** require that the "specification shall contain a written
 description of the invention ...." This requirement is separate and distinct from the
 enablement requirement. *Ariad Pharm., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co.,*
 598 F.3d 1336, 1340, 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (en banc); *Vas-Cath,
 Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1560, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1114 (Fed. Cir.
 1991); see also *Univ. of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co.,* 358 F.3d
 916, 920-23, 69 USPQ2d 1886, 1890-93 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (discussing the history and
 purpose of the written description requirement); *In re Curtis,* 354
 F.3d 1347, 1357, 69 USPQ2d 1274, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("conclusive evidence of a
 claim’s enablement is not equally conclusive of that claim’s satisfactory written
 description"). The written description requirement has several policy objectives. "[T]he
 ‘essential goal’ of the description of the invention requirement is to clearly convey
 the information that an applicant has invented the subject matter which is claimed."
 *In re Barker,* 559 F.2d 588, 592 n.4, 194 USPQ 470, 473 n.4 (CCPA
 1977). Another objective is to convey to the public what the applicant claims as the
 invention. See *Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3d
 1559, 1566, 43 USPQ2d 1398, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1997), *cert. denied,* 523
 U.S. 1089 (1998). "The ‘written description’ requirement implements the principle that a
 patent must describe the technology that is sought to be patented; the requirement
 serves both to satisfy the inventor’s obligation to disclose the technologic knowledge
 upon which the patent is based, and to demonstrate that the patentee was in possession
 of the invention that is claimed." *Capon v. Eshhar,* 418 F.3d 1349,
 1357, 76 USPQ2d 1078, 1084 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Further, the written description
 requirement promotes the progress of the useful arts by ensuring that patentees
 adequately describe their inventions in their patent specifications in exchange for the
 right to exclude others from practicing the invention for the duration of the patent’s
 term.
 


To satisfy the written description requirement, a patent specification
 must describe the claimed invention in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can
 reasonably conclude that the inventor had possession of the claimed invention. See,
 e.g., *Moba, B.V. v. Diamond Automation, Inc.,* 325 F.3d 1306, 1319, 66
 USPQ2d 1429, 1438 (Fed. Cir. 2003); *Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935
 F.2d at 1563, 19 USPQ2d at 1116. However, a showing of possession alone does not cure
 the lack of a written description. *Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe,
 Inc.,* 323 F.3d 956, 969-70, 63 USPQ2d 1609, 1617 (Fed. Cir. 2002). For
 example, it is now well accepted that a satisfactory description may be found in
 originally-filed claims or any other portion of the originally-filed specification. See
 *In re Koller,* 613 F.2d 819, 204 USPQ 702 (CCPA 1980); *In
 re Gardner,* 475 F.2d 1389, 177 USPQ 396 (CCPA 1973); *In re
 Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976). However, that does not
 mean that all originally-filed claims have adequate written support. The specification
 must still be examined to assess whether an originally-filed claim has adequate support
 in the written disclosure and/or the drawings. 
 


An applicant shows possession of the claimed invention by describing
 the claimed invention with all of its limitations using such descriptive means as words,
 structures, figures, diagrams, and formulas that fully set forth the claimed invention.
 *Lockwood v. Amer. Airlines, Inc.,* 107 F.3d 1565, 1572, 41 USPQ2d
 1961, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Possession may be shown in a variety of ways including
 description of an actual reduction to practice, or by showing that the invention was
 "ready for patenting" such as by the disclosure of drawings or structural chemical
 formulas that show that the invention was complete, or by describing distinguishing
 identifying characteristics sufficient to show that the applicant was in possession of
 the claimed invention. See, e.g., *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc.,* 525
 U.S. 55, 68, 119 S.Ct. 304, 312, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647 (1998); *Eli
 Lilly,* 119 F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at 1406; *Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai
 Pharm.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 1206, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (one
 must define a compound by "whatever characteristics sufficiently distinguish it").
 "Compliance with the written description requirement is essentially a fact-based inquiry
 that will ‘necessarily vary depending on the nature of the invention claimed.’"
 *Enzo Biochem,* 323 F.3d at 963, 63 USPQ2d at 1612. An application
 specification may show actual reduction to practice by describing testing of the claimed
 invention or, in the case of certain biological materials, by specifically describing a
 deposit made in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.801](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333189)***et seq.* See *Enzo Biochem,* 323 F.3d at 965, 63
 USPQ2d at 1614 ("reference in the specification to a deposit may also satisfy the
 written description requirement with respect to a claimed material"); see also Deposit
 of Biological Materials for Patent Purposes, Final Rule, 54 Fed. Reg. 34,864 (August 22,
 1989) ("The requirement for a specific identification is consistent with the description
 requirement of the first paragraph of **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, and to provide an
 antecedent basis for the biological material which either has been or will be deposited
 before the patent is granted." *Id.* at 34,876. "The description must
 be sufficient to permit verification that the deposited biological material is in fact
 that disclosed. Once the patent issues, the description must be sufficient to aid in the
 resolution of questions of infringement." *Id.* at 34,880.) Such a
 deposit is not a substitute for a written description of the claimed invention. The
 written description of the deposited material needs to be as complete as possible
 because the examination for patentability proceeds solely on the basis of the written
 description. See, e.g., *In re Lundak,* 773 F.2d 1216, 227 USPQ 90
 (Fed. Cir. 1985); see also 54 Fed. Reg. at 34,880 ("As a general rule, the more
 information that is provided about a particular deposited biological material, the
 better the examiner will be able to compare the identity and characteristics of the
 deposited biological material with the prior art.").
 


A question as to whether a specification provides an adequate written
 description may arise in the context of determining whether an original claim is
 described sufficiently (see, e.g., *LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Resource Mapping,
 Inc.,* 424 F.3d 1336, 1345, 76 USPQ2d 1724, 1733 (Fed. Cir. 2005);
 *Enzo Biochem,* 323 F.3d at 968, 63 USPQ2d at 1616 (Fed. Cir. 2002);
 *Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3d 1559, 43 USPQ2d 1398)), whether new or amended
 claims are supported by the description of the invention in the application as filed
 (see, e.g., *In re Wright,* 866 F.2d 422, 9 USPQ2d 1649 (Fed. Cir.
 1989)), whether a claimed invention is entitled to the benefit of an earlier priority
 date or effective filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**,
 **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, or **[386](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_27b56_2ab)** (see, e.g., *New
 Railhead Mfg. L.L.C. v. Vermeer Mfg. Co.,* 298 F.3d 1290, 63 USPQ2d 1843
 (Fed. Cir. 2002); *Tronzo v. Biomet, Inc.,* 156 F.3d 1154, 47 USPQ2d
 1829 (Fed. Cir. 1998); *Fiers v. Revel,* 984 F.2d 1164, 25 USPQ2d 1601
 (Fed. Cir. 1993); *In re Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 1200, 26 USPQ2d 1600,
 1603 (Fed. Cir. 1993)), or whether a specification provides support for a claim
 corresponding to a count in an interference (see, e.g., *Martin v.
 Mayer,* 823 F.2d 500, 503, 3 USPQ2d 1333, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1987);
 *Fields v. Conover,* 443 F.2d 1386, 170 USPQ 276 (CCPA 1971)).
 Compliance with the written description requirement is a question of fact which must be
 resolved on a case-by-case basis. *Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935
 F.2d at 1563, 19 USPQ2d at 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1991).
 

***A.******Original Claims***There is a presumption that an adequate written description of the
 claimed invention is present when the application is filed. *In re
 Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 263, 191 USPQ 90, 97 (CCPA 1976) ("[W]e are of
 the opinion that the PTO has the initial burden of presenting evidence or reasons why
 persons skilled in the art would not recognize in the disclosure a description of the
 invention defined by the claims."). However, as discussed in subsection I,
 *supra,* issues of adequate written description may arise even
 for original claims, for example, when an aspect of the claimed invention has not
 been described with sufficient particularity such that one skilled in the art would
 recognize that the applicant had possession of the claimed invention at the time of
 filing. The claimed invention as a whole may not be adequately described if the
 claims require an essential or critical feature which is not adequately described in
 the specification and which is not conventional or known in the art. Consider the
 claim "A gene comprising SEQ ID NO:1." The claim may be construed to include specific
 structures in addition to SEQ ID NO:1, such as a promoter, a coding region, or other
 elements. Although SEQ ID NO:1 is fully disclosed, there may be insufficient
 description of other structures embraced by the claim (e.g., promoters, enhancers,
 coding regions, and other regulatory elements). For guidance on subject matter
 eligibility of such claims, see **[MPEP § 2106](s2106.html#d0e197244)**.
 


An invention described solely in terms of a method of making and/or
 its function may lack written descriptive support where there is no described or
 art-recognized correlation between the disclosed function and the structure(s)
 responsible for the function. For example, the amino acid sequence of a protein along
 with knowledge of the genetic code might put an inventor in possession of the genus
 of nucleic acids capable of encoding the protein, but the same information would not
 place the inventor in possession of the naturally-occurring DNA or mRNA encoding the
 protein. See *In re Bell,* 991 F.2d 781, 26 USPQ2d 1529 (Fed. Cir.
 1993); *In re Deuel,* 51 F.3d 1552, 34 USPQ2d 1210 (Fed. Cir. 1995)
 (holding that a process could not render the product of that process obvious under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**). (For guidance on subject matter eligibility of claims to
 naturally-occurring compositions, see **[MPEP § 2106](s2106.html#d0e197244)**.) The Federal Circuit
 has pointed out that, under United States law, a description that merely renders a
 claimed invention obvious may not sufficiently describe the invention for the
 purposes of the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**.
 See *Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3d at 1567, 43 USPQ2d at 1405; compare
 *Fonar Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co.,* 107 F.3d 1543, 1549, 41 USPQ2d
 1801, 1805 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("As a general rule, where software constitutes part of a
 best mode of carrying out an invention, description of such a best mode is satisfied
 by a disclosure of the functions of the software. This is because, normally, writing
 code for such software is within the skill of the art, not requiring undue
 experimentation, once its functions have been disclosed.... Thus, flow charts or
 source code listings are not a requirement for adequately disclosing the functions of
 software.").
 


Written description issues may also arise if the knowledge and level
 of skill in the art would not have permitted the ordinary artisan to immediately
 envisage the claimed product arising from the disclosed process. See, e.g.,*Fujikawa v. Wattanasin,* 93 F.3d 1559, 1571, 39 USPQ2d 1895, 1905 (Fed.
 Cir. 1996) (a "laundry list" disclosure of every possible moiety does not necessarily
 constitute a written description of every species in a genus because it would not
 "reasonably lead" those skilled in the art to any particular species); *In re
 Ruschig,* 379 F.2d 990, 995, 154 USPQ 118, 123 (CCPA 1967)
 ("*If* n-propylamine had been used in making the compound instead
 of n-butylamine, the compound of claim 13 would have resulted. Appellants submit to
 us, as they did to the board, an imaginary specific example patterned on specific
 example 6 by which the above butyl compound is made so that we can see what a simple
 change would have resulted in a specific supporting disclosure being present in the
 present specification. The trouble is that there is no such disclosure, easy though
 it is to imagine it." (emphasis in original)); *Purdue Pharma L.P. v.
 Faulding Inc.,* 230 F.3d 1320, 1328, 56 USPQ2d 1481, 1487 (Fed. Cir.
 2000) ("[T]he specification does not clearly disclose to the skilled artisan that the
 inventors ... considered the ratio... to be part of their invention .... There is
 therefore no force to Purdue’s argument that the written description requirement was
 satisfied because the disclosure revealed a broad invention from which the
 [later-filed] claims carved out a patentable portion").
 

***B.******New or Amended Claims***The proscription against the introduction of new matter in a patent
 application (**[35
 U.S.C. 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)** and **[251](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345)**) serves to prevent an
 applicant from adding information that goes beyond the subject matter originally
 filed. See *In re Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d 1212, 1214, 211 USPQ 323, 326
 (CCPA 1981); see also **[MPEP §§ 2163.06](s2163.html#d0e215023)** through **[2163.07](s2163.html#d0e215099)** for a more
 detailed discussion of the written description requirement and its relationship to
 new matter. The claims as filed in the original specification are part of the
 disclosure and, therefore, if an application as originally filed contains a claim
 disclosing material not found in the remainder of the specification, the applicant
 may amend the specification to include the claimed subject matter. *In re
 Benno,* 768 F.2d 1340, 226 USPQ 683 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Thus, the written
 description requirement prevents an applicant from claiming subject matter that was
 not adequately described in the specification as filed. New or amended claims which
 introduce elements or limitations that are not supported by the as-filed disclosure
 violate the written description requirement. See, e.g., *In re
 Lukach,* 442 F.2d 967, 169 USPQ 795 (CCPA 1971) (subgenus range was not
 supported by generic disclosure and specific example within the subgenus range);
 *In re Smith,* 458 F.2d 1389, 1395, 173 USPQ 679, 683 (CCPA 1972)
 (an adequate description of a genus may not support claims to a subgenus or species
 within the genus).
 


While there is no *in haec verba* requirement,
 newly added claims or claim limitations must be supported in the specification
 through express, implicit, or inherent disclosure. An amendment to correct an obvious
 error does not constitute new matter where the ordinary artisan would not only
 recognize the existence of the error in the specification, but also recognize the
 appropriate correction. *In re Oda,* 443 F.2d 1200, 170 USPQ 268
 (CCPA 1971). With respect to the correction of sequencing errors in applications
 disclosing nucleic acid and/or amino acid sequences, it is well known that sequencing
 errors are a common problem in molecular biology. See, e.g., David Laehnemann
 *et al.,* Denoising DNA deep sequencing data—high-throughput
 sequencing errors and their correction, 17 *Briefings in
 Bioinformatics* 154–1791 (2016); Peter Richterich, Estimation of Errors
 in ‘Raw’ DNA Sequences: A Validation Study, 8 *Genome Research*
 251-59 (1998). For example, if an application as filed includes incorrect nucleic
 acid sequence information and references a deposit of the sequenced material made in
 accordance with the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.801](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333189)***et seq.,* an amendment to correct the nucleic acid sequence may be
 permissible where the amendment conforms the sequence information to the compound
 described in the specification and covered by the claims. See *Cubist Pharm.,
 Inc. v. Hospira, Inc.,* 805 F.3d 1112, 1118, 117 USPQ2d 1054, 1059 (Fed.
 Cir. 2015)( "The fact that the inventors were mistaken as to one aspect of the
 structure of daptomycin at the time the application [ ] was filed does not render the
 specification inadequate to satisfy the written description requirement. It was
 enough that the specification disclosed relevant identifying characteristics that
 distinguished daptomycin from other compounds and thus showed that the inventors had
 possession of daptomycin, even though they may not have had an accurate picture of
 the entire chemical structure of that compound." *Id.* at 1120, 117
 USPQ2d at 1060.) Deposits made after the filing date may be relied upon to provide
 support for the correction of sequence information only if applicant submits a
 statement in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.804](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333323)** stating that the
 biological material which is deposited is the biological material specifically
 defined in the application as filed.
 


Under certain circumstances, omission of a limitation can raise an
 issue regarding whether the inventor had possession of a broader, more generic
 invention. See, e.g., *PIN/NIP, Inc. v. Platte Chem. Co.,* 304 F.3d
 1235, 1248, 64 USPQ2d 1344, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (Claim for a method of inhibiting
 sprout growth on tubers by treating them with spaced, *sequential* application of two chemicals was held invalid for lack of adequate written
 description where the specification indicated that invention was a method of applying
 a *"composition"* containing the two chemicals.); *Gentry
 Gallery, Inc. v. Berkline Corp.,* 134 F.3d 1473, 45 USPQ2d 1498 (Fed.
 Cir. 1998) (claims to a sectional sofa comprising, *inter alia,* a
 console and a control means were held invalid for failing to satisfy the written
 description requirement where the claims were broadened by removing the location of
 the control means); *Johnson Worldwide Assoc. v. Zebco Corp.,* 175
 F.3d 985, 993, 50 USPQ2d 1607, 1613 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (stating that, in
 *Gentry Gallery,* the "court’s determination that the patent
 disclosure did not support a broad meaning for the disputed claim terms was premised
 on clear statements in the written description that described the location of a claim
 element--the ‘control means’ --as ‘the only possible location’ and that variations
 were ‘outside the stated purpose of the invention.’ … *Gentry
 Gallery,* then, considers the situation where the patent’s disclosure
 makes crystal clear that a particular (i.e., narrow) understanding of a claim term is
 an ‘essential element of [the inventor’s] invention.’"); see also *Tronzo v.
 Biomet,* 156 F.3d at 1158-59, 47 USPQ2d at 1833 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (claims
 to generic cup shape were not entitled to filing date of parent application which
 disclosed "conical cup" in view of the disclosure of the parent application stating
 the advantages and importance of the conical shape.). A claim that omits an element
 that applicant describes as an essential or critical feature of the invention
 originally disclosed does not comply with the written description requirement. See
 *Gentry Gallery,* 134 F.3d at 1480, 45 USPQ2d at 1503;
 *In re Sus,* 306 F.2d 494, 504, 134 USPQ 301, 309 (CCPA 1962)
 ("[O]ne skilled in this art would not be taught by the written description of the
 invention in the specification that any ‘aryl or substituted aryl radical’ would be
 suitable for the purposes of the invention but rather that only *certain aryl
 radicals* and certain specifically substituted aryl radicals [i.e., aryl
 azides] would be suitable for such purposes."(emphasis in original)). A claim which
 omits matter disclosed to be essential to the invention as described in the
 specification or in other statements of record may also be subject to rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, as not enabling, or under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. See *In re
 Mayhew,* 527 F.2d 1229, 188 USPQ 356 (CCPA 1976); *In re
 Venezia,* 530 F.2d 956, 189 USPQ 149 (CCPA 1976); and *In re
 Collier,* 397 F.2d 1003, 158 USPQ 266 (CCPA 1968). See also
 **[MPEP
 § 2172.01](s2172.html#d0e217526)**.
 


The fundamental factual inquiry is whether the specification conveys
 with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date
 sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now claimed. See, e.g.,
 *Vas-Cath, Inc.,* 935 F.2d at 1563-64, 19 USPQ2d at 1117.
 

**II.** **METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING ADEQUACY OF WRITTEN DESCRIPTION*** 

***A.******Read and Analyze the Specification for Compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112(a)
 or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph***Office personnel should adhere to the following procedures when
 reviewing patent applications for compliance with the written description requirement
 of **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. There is a presumption that an adequate written description of the claimed
 invention is present in the specification as filed, *Wertheim,* 541
 F.2d at 262, 191 USPQ at 96, thus the examiner has the initial burden, after a
 thorough reading and evaluation of the content of the application, of presenting
 evidence or reasons why a person skilled in the art would not recognize the written
 description of the invention as providing adequate support for the claimed invention.
 To make a *prima facie* case, it is necessary to identify the claim
 limitations that are not adequately supported, and explain why the claim is not fully
 supported by the disclosure. For example, in *Hyatt v. Dudas,* 492
 F.3d 1365, 1371, 83 USPQ2d 1373, 1376-1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the examiner made a
 *prima facie* case by clearly and specifically explaining why
 applicant’s specification did not support the particular claimed combination of
 elements, even though applicant’s specification listed each and every element in the
 claimed combination. The court found the "examiner was explicit that while each
 element may be individually described in the specification, the deficiency was lack
 of adequate description of their combination" and, thus, "[t]he burden was then
 properly shifted to [inventor] to cite to the examiner where adequate written
 description could be found or to make an amendment to address the deficiency."
 *Id.;* see also *Stored Value Solutions, Inc. v. Card
 Activation Techs.,* 499 Fed.App’x 5, 13-14 (Fed. Cir. 2012)
 (non-precedential) (Finding inadequate written support for claims drawn to a method
 of processing debit purchase transactions requiring three separate authorization
 codes because "the written description [did] not contain a method that include[d] all
 three codes" and "[e]ach authorization code is an important claim limitation, and the
 presence of multiple authorization codes in [the claim] was essential".). 
 


With respect to newly added or amended claims,
 applicant should show support in the original disclosure for the new or amended
 claims. See, e.g., *Hyatt v. Dudas,* 492 F.3d 1365, 1370, n.4 (Fed.
 Cir. 2007) (citing **[MPEP § 2163.04](s2163.html#d0e214731)** which provides that a "simple statement
 such as ‘applicant has not pointed out where the new (or amended) claim is supported,
 nor does there appear to be a written description of the claim limitation ‘\_\_\_’ in
 the application as filed’ may be sufficient where the claim is a new or amended
 claim, the support for the limitation is not apparent, and applicant has not pointed
 out where the limitation is supported."); see also **[MPEP §§ 714.02](s714.html#d0e86906)** and
 **[2163.06](s2163.html#d0e215023)** ("Applicant should ... specifically point out the
 support for any amendments made to the disclosure."); and **[MPEP § 2163.04](s2163.html#d0e214731)**
 ("If applicant amends the claims and points out where and/or how the originally filed
 disclosure supports the amendment(s), and the examiner finds that the disclosure does
 not reasonably convey that the inventor had possession of the subject matter of the
 amendment at the time of the filing of the application, the examiner has the initial
 burden of presenting evidence or reasoning to explain why persons skilled in the art
 would not recognize in the disclosure a description of the invention defined by the
 claims."). The inquiry into whether the description requirement is met is a question
 of fact that must be determined on a case-by-case basis. *AbbVie Deutschland
 GmbH & Co., KG v. Janssen Biotech, Inc.,* 759 F.3d 1285, 1297, 111
 USPQ2d 1780, 1788 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("Whether a patent claim is supported by an
 adequate written description is a question of fact."); *In re
 Smith,* 458 F.2d 1389, 1395, 173 USPQ 679, 683 (CCPA 1972) ("Precisely
 how close [to the claimed invention] the description must come to comply with Sec.
 112 must be left to case-by-case development."); *In re Wertheim,*
 541 F.2d at 262, 191 USPQ at 96 (inquiry is primarily factual and depends on the
 nature of the invention and the amount of knowledge imparted to those skilled in the
 art by the disclosure).
 

**1.** **For Each Claim, Determine What the Claim as a Whole Covers** Claim construction is an essential part of the examination
 process. Each claim must be separately analyzed and given its broadest reasonable
 interpretation in light of and consistent with the written description. See, e.g.,
 *In re Katz Interactive Call Processing Patent Litigation,*
 639 F.3d 1303, 1319-1320, 97 USPQ2d 1737, 1750 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (stating that
 "[t]he construction of the claims [is] important to the written description
 analysis" and patent holder’s failure "to point to a genuine factual dispute over
 whether the specification disclosed" the claimed subject matter made summary
 judgment proper on that issue.); *In re Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048,
 1053-54, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The entire claim must be
 considered, including the preamble language and the transitional phrase. "Preamble
 language" is that language in a claim appearing before the transitional phase,
 e.g., before "comprising," "consisting essentially of," or "consisting of." The
 transitional term "comprising" (and other comparable terms, e.g., "containing,"
 and "including") is "open-ended" in that it covers the expressly recited subject
 matter, alone or in combination with unrecited subject matter. See, e.g.,
 *Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron Corp.,* 112 F.3d 495, 501, 42
 USPQ2d 1608, 1613 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("‘Comprising’ is a term of art used in claim
 language which means that the named elements are essential, but other elements may
 be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim."); *Ex
 parte Davis,* 80 USPQ 448, 450 (Bd. App. 1948) ("comprising" leaves
 the "claim open for the inclusion of unspecified ingredients even in major
 amounts"); see also **[MPEP § 2111.03](s2111.html#d0e200824)**. "By using the term ‘consisting
 essentially of,’ the drafter signals that the invention necessarily includes the
 listed ingredients and is open to unlisted ingredients that do not materially
 affect the basic and novel properties of the invention. A ‘consisting essentially
 of’ claim occupies a middle ground between closed claims that are written in a
 ‘consisting of’ format and fully open claims that are drafted in a ‘comprising’
 format." *PPG Indus. v. Guardian Indus.,* 156 F.3d 1351, 1354, 48
 USPQ2d 1351, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 1998). For the purposes of searching for and
 applying prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, absent a clear indication in the specification or
 claims of what the basic and novel characteristics actually are, "consisting
 essentially of" will be construed as equivalent to "comprising." See, e.g.,
 *PPG,* 156 F.3d at 1355, 48 USPQ2d at 1355 ("PPG could have
 defined the scope of the phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ for purposes of its
 patent by making clear in its specification what it regarded as constituting a
 material change in the basic and novel characteristics of the invention."); see
 also *AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac,* 344 F3.d 1234, 1239-1240, 68
 USPQ2d 1280, 1283-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003); *In re Janakirama-Rao,*
 317 F.2d 951, 954, 137 USPQ 893, 895-96 (CCPA 1963). If an applicant contends that
 additional steps or materials in the prior art are excluded by the recitation of
 "consisting essentially of," applicant has the burden of showing that the
 introduction of additional steps or components would materially change the
 characteristics of applicant’s invention. *In re De Lajarte,* 337
 F.2d 870, 143 USPQ 256 (CCPA 1964); see also **[MPEP § 2111.03](s2111.html#d0e200824)**.
 The claim as a whole, including all limitations found in the preamble (see
 *Pac-Tec Inc. v. Amerace Corp.,* 903 F.2d 796, 801, 14 USPQ2d
 1871, 1876 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (determining that preamble language that constitutes a
 structural limitation is actually part of the claimed invention)), the
 transitional phrase, and the body of the claim, must be sufficiently supported to
 satisfy the written description requirement. An applicant shows possession of the
 claimed invention by describing the claimed invention with all of its limitations.
 *Lockwood,* 107 F.3d at 1572, 41 USPQ2d at 1966.
 


The examiner should evaluate each claim to determine if
 sufficient structures, acts, or functions are recited to make clear the scope and
 meaning of the claim, including the weight to be given the preamble. See, e.g.,
 *Bell Communications Research, Inc. v. Vitalink Communications
 Corp.,* 55 F.3d 615, 620, 34 USPQ2d 1816, 1820 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("[A]
 claim preamble has the import that the claim as a whole suggests for it.");
 *Corning Glass Works v. Sumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc.,* 868 F.2d
 1251, 1257, 9 USPQ2d 1962, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (The determination of whether
 preamble recitations are structural limitations can be resolved only on review of
 the entirety of the application "to gain an understanding of what the inventors
 actually invented and intended to encompass by the claim."). The absence of
 definitions or details for well-established terms or procedures should not be the
 basis of a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, for lack of adequate written
 description. Limitations may not, however, be imported into the claims from the
 specification.
 

**2.** **Review the Entire Application to Understand How Applicant Provides Support
 for the Claimed Invention Including Each Element and/or Step**Prior to determining whether the disclosure provides adequate
 written description for the claimed subject matter, the examiner should review the
 claims and the entire specification, including the specific embodiments, figures,
 and sequence listings, to understand how applicant provides support for the
 various features of the claimed invention. The disclosure of an element may be
 critical where those of ordinary skill in the art would require it to understand
 that applicant was in possession of the invention. Compare
 *Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d at 1215, 211 USPQ at 327 ("one skilled
 in the art who read Rasmussen’s specification would understand that it is
 unimportant how the layers are adhered, so long as they are adhered") (emphasis in
 original), with *Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharm.Co., Ltd.,* 927 F.2d
 1200, 1206, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("it is well established in our
 law that conception of a chemical compound requires that the inventor be able to
 define it so as to distinguish it from other materials, and to describe how to
 obtain it"). The analysis of whether the specification complies with the written
 description requirement calls for the examiner to compare the scope of the claim
 with the scope of the description to determine whether applicant has demonstrated
 possession of the claimed invention. Such a review is conducted from the
 standpoint of one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the application was
 filed (see, e.g., *Wang Labs., Inc. v. Toshiba Corp.,* 993 F.2d
 858, 865, 26 USPQ2d 1767, 1774 (Fed. Cir. 1993)) and should include a
 determination of the field of the invention and the level of skill and knowledge
 in the art. For some arts, there is an inverse correlation between the level of
 skill and knowledge in the art and the specificity of disclosure necessary to
 satisfy the written description requirement. Information which is well known in
 the art need not be described in detail in the specification. See, e.g.,
 *Hybritech, Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc.,* 802 F.2d
 1367, 1379-80, 231 USPQ 81, 90 (Fed. Cir. 1986). However, sufficient information
 must be provided to show that the inventor had possession of the invention as
 claimed.
 

**3.** **Determine Whether There is Sufficient Written Description to Inform a
 Skilled Artisan That Applicant was in Possession of the Claimed Invention as a
 Whole at the Time the Application Was Filed*** 

**(a)** **Original claims** Possession may be shown in many ways. For example, possession
 may be shown by describing an actual reduction to practice of the claimed
 invention. Possession may also be shown by a clear depiction of the invention
 in detailed drawings or in structural chemical formulas which permit a person
 skilled in the art to clearly recognize that applicant had possession of the
 claimed invention. An adequate written description of the invention may be
 shown by any description of sufficient, relevant, identifying characteristics
 so long as a person skilled in the art would recognize that the inventor had
 possession of the claimed invention. See, e.g., *Purdue Pharma L.P. v.
 Faulding Inc.,* 230 F.3d 1320, 1323, 56 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed.
 Cir. 2000) (the written description "inquiry is a factual one and must be
 assessed on a case-by-case basis"); see also *Pfaff v. Wells Elec.,
 Inc.,* 55 U.S. at 66, 119 S.Ct. at 311, 48 USPQ2d at 1646 ("The
 word ‘invention’ must refer to a concept that is complete, rather than merely
 one that is ‘substantially complete.’ It is true that reduction to practice
 ordinarily provides the best evidence that an invention is complete. But just
 because reduction to practice is sufficient evidence of completion, it does not
 follow that proof of reduction to practice is necessary in every case. Indeed,
 both the facts of the Telephone Cases and the facts of this case demonstrate
 that one can prove that an invention is complete and ready for patenting before
 it has actually been reduced to practice.").
 


A specification may describe an actual reduction to practice
 by showing that the inventor constructed an embodiment or performed a process
 that met all the limitations of the claim and determined that the invention
 would work for its intended purpose. *Cooper v. Goldfarb,* 154
 F.3d 1321, 1327, 47 USPQ2d 1896, 1901 (Fed. Cir. 1998). See also *UMC
 Elecs. Co. v. United States,* 816 F.2d 647, 652, 2 USPQ2d 1465,
 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("[T]here cannot be a reduction to practice of the
 invention ... without a physical embodiment which includes all limitations of
 the claim."); *Estee Lauder Inc. v. L’Oreal, S.A.,* 129 F.3d
 588, 593, 44 USPQ2d 1610, 1614 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("[A] reduction to practice
 does not occur until the inventor has determined that the invention will work
 for its intended purpose."); *Mahurkar v. C.R. Bard, Inc.,* 79
 F.3d 1572, 1578, 38 USPQ2d 1288, 1291 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (determining that the
 invention will work for its intended purpose may require testing depending on
 the character of the invention and the problem it solves). Description of an
 actual reduction to practice of a biological material may be shown by
 specifically describing a deposit made in accordance with the requirements of
 **[37 CFR
 1.801](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333189)***et seq.,* especially **[37 CFR 1.804](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333323)** and
 **[1.809](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333576)**; see also subsection I. *supra.*


An applicant may show possession of an invention by disclosure
 of drawings or structural chemical formulas that are sufficiently detailed to
 show that applicant was in possession of the claimed invention as a whole. See,
 e.g., *Vas-Cath,* 935 F.2d at 1565, 19 USPQ2d at 1118
 ("drawings alone may provide a ‘written description’ of an invention as
 required by **[Sec. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)**"); *In re
 Wolfensperger,* 302 F.2d 950, 133 USPQ 537 (CCPA 1962) (the
 drawings of applicant’s specification provided sufficient written descriptive
 support for the claim limitation at issue); *Autogiro Co. of Am. v.
 United States,* 384 F.2d 391, 398, 155 USPQ 697, 703 (Ct. Cl. 1967)
 ("In those instances where a visual representation can flesh out words,
 drawings may be used in the same manner and with the same limitations as the
 specification."); *Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at
 1406 ("In claims involving chemical materials, generic formulae usually
 indicate with specificity what the generic claims encompass. One skilled in the
 art can distinguish such a formula from others and can identify many of the
 species that the claims encompass. Accordingly, such a formula is normally an
 adequate description of the claimed genus."). The description need only
 describe in detail that which is new or not conventional. See
 *Hybritech v. Monoclonal Antibodies,* 802 F.2d at 1384, 231
 USPQ at 94. This is equally true whether the claimed invention is directed to a
 product or a process.
 


An applicant may also show that an invention is complete by
 disclosure of sufficiently detailed, relevant identifying characteristics which
 provide evidence that applicant was in possession of the claimed invention,
 i.e., complete or partial structure, other physical and/or chemical properties,
 functional characteristics when coupled with a known or disclosed correlation
 between function and structure, or some combination of such characteristics.
 *Enzo Biochem,* 323 F.3d at 964, 63 USPQ2d at 1613 (quoting
 the Written Description Guidelines, 66 Fed. Reg. at 1106, n. 49, stating that
 "if the art has established a strong correlation between structure and
 function, one skilled in the art would be able to predict with a reasonable
 degree of confidence the structure of the claimed invention from a recitation
 of its function".). "Thus, the written description requirement may be satisfied
 through disclosure of function and minimal structure when there is a
 well-established correlation between structure and function."
 *Id.*


For some biomolecules, examples of identifying characteristics
 include a sequence, structure, binding affinity, binding specificity, molecular
 weight, and length. Although structural formulas provide a convenient method of
 demonstrating possession of specific molecules, other identifying
 characteristics or combinations of characteristics may demonstrate the
 requisite possession. As explained by the Federal Circuit, "(1) examples are
 not necessary to support the adequacy of a written description; (2) the written
 description standard may be met … even where actual reduction to practice of an
 invention is absent; and (3) there is no per se rule that an adequate written
 description of an invention that involves a biological macromolecule must
 contain a recitation of known structure." *Falkner v. Inglis,*
 448 F.3d 1357, 1366, 79 USPQ2d 1001, 1007 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also
 *Capon v. Eshhar,* 418 F.3d at 1358, 76 USPQ2d at 1084
 ("The Board erred in holding that the specifications do not meet the written
 description requirement because they do not reiterate the structure or formula
 or chemical name for the nucleotide sequences of the claimed chimeric genes"
 where the genes were novel combinations of known DNA segments.). However, the
 claimed invention itself must be adequately described in the written disclosure
 and/or the drawings. For example, disclosure of an antigen fully characterized
 by its structure, formula, chemical name, physical properties, or deposit in a
 public depository does not, without more, provide an adequate written
 description of an antibody claimed by its binding affinity to that antigen,
 even when preparation of such an antibody is routine and conventional. See
 *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi,* 872 F.3d 1367, 1378, 124 USPQ2d
 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2017)("knowledge of the chemical structure of an antigen
 [does not give] the required kind of structure-identifying information about
 the corresponding antibodies"); see also *Centocor Ortho Biotech, Inc.
 v. Abbott Labs.,* 636 F.3d 1341, 1351-52, 97 USPQ2d 1870, 1877
 (Fed. Cir. 2011)(patent disclosed the antigen the claimed antibody was supposed
 to bind, but did not disclose any antibodies with the specific claimed
 properties). 
 


Other ways of establishing possession of a
 claimed invention may include unique cleavage by particular enzymes,
 isoelectric points of fragments, detailed restriction enzyme maps, a comparison
 of enzymatic activities, or antibody cross-reactivity. See
 *Lockwood,* 107 F.3d at 1572, 41 USPQ2d at 1966 (Stating
 that the written description requirement may be satisfied by using "such
 descriptive means as words, structures, figures, diagrams, formulas, etc., that
 fully set forth the claimed invention."). Conversely, describing a composition
 by its function alone typically will not suffice to sufficiently describe the
 composition. See *Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3 at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at
 1406 (Holding that description of a gene’s function will not enable claims to
 the gene "because it is only an indication of what the gene does, rather than
 what it is."); see also *Fiers,* 984 F.2d at 1169-71, 25
 USPQ2d at 1605-06 (discussing *Amgen Inc. v. Chugai Pharm.
 Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 18 USPQ2d 1016 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). An adequate
 written description of a chemical invention also requires a precise definition,
 such as by structure, formula, chemical name, or physical properties, and not
 merely a wish or plan for obtaining the chemical invention claimed. See, e.g.,
 *Univ. of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co.,* 358 F.3d
 916, 927, 69 USPQ2d 1886, 1894-95 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (The patent at issue claimed
 a method of selectively inhibiting PGHS-2 activity by administering a
 non-steroidal compound that selectively inhibits activity of the PGHS-2 gene
 product, however the patent did not disclose any compounds that can be used in
 the claimed methods. While there was a description of assays for screening
 compounds to identify those that inhibit the expression or activity of the
 PGHS-2 gene product, there was no disclosure of which peptides,
 polynucleotides, and small organic molecules selectively inhibit PGHS-2. The
 court held that "[w]ithout such disclosure, the claimed methods cannot be said
 to have been described.").
 


If a claim limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,

 original disclosure contained in the summary and detailed description of the
 invention portions of the specification, but also the original claims,
 abstract, and drawings. A means- (or step-) plus- function claim limitation is
 adequately described under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or

 unclear." *In re Noll,* 545 F.2d 141, 149, 191 USPQ 721, 727
 (CCPA 1976). See "Supplemental Examination Guidelines for Determining the
 Applicability of **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 6,"
 65 Fed. Reg. 38510, June 21, 2000; see also **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**.
 However, when a means- (or step-) plus-function claim limitation is found to be
 indefinite based on failure of the specification to disclose sufficient
 corresponding structure, materials, or acts that perform the entire claimed
 function, then the claim limitation necessarily lacks an adequate written
 description. Thus, when a claim is rejected as indefinite under
 **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 second paragraph because there is no corresponding structure, materials, or
 acts, or an inadequate disclosure of corresponding structure, materials, or
 acts, for a means- (or step-) plus-function claim limitation, then the claim
 must also be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, for lack of an adequate
 written description. 
 


What is conventional or well known to one of ordinary skill in
 the art need not be disclosed in detail. See *Hybritech Inc. v.
 Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc.,* 802 F.2d at 1384, 231 USPQ at 94. See
 also *Capon v. Eshhar,* 418 F.3d 1349, 1357, 76 USPQ2d 1078,
 1085 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("The ‘written description’ requirement must be applied
 in the context of the particular invention and the state of the knowledge…. As
 each field evolves, the balance also evolves between what is known and what is
 added by each inventive contribution."). If a skilled artisan would have
 understood the inventor to be in possession of the claimed invention at the
 time of filing, even if every nuance of the claims is not explicitly described
 in the specification, then the adequate description requirement is met. See,
 e.g., *Vas-Cath,* 935 F.2d at 1563, 19 USPQ2d at 1116;
 *Martin v. Johnson,* 454 F.2d 746, 751, 172 USPQ 391, 395
 (CCPA 1972) (stating "the description need not be in *ipsis
 verbis* [i.e., "in the same words"] to be sufficient").
 


A claim which is limited to a single disclosed embodiment or
 species is analyzed as a claim drawn to a single embodiment or species, whereas
 a claim which encompasses two or more embodiments or species within the scope
 of the claim is analyzed as a claim drawn to a genus. See also
 **[MPEP §
 806.04(e)](s806.html#d0e103749)**.
 

**i)** **For Each Claim Drawn to a Single Embodiment or Species:** * (A) Determine whether the application describes an actual
 reduction to practice of the claimed invention.


* (B) If the application does not describe an actual
 reduction to practice, determine whether the invention is complete as
 evidenced by a reduction to drawings or structural chemical formulas
 that are sufficiently detailed to show that applicant was in
 possession of the claimed invention as a whole.


* (C) If the application does not describe an actual
 reduction to practice or reduction to drawings or structural chemical
 formula as discussed above, determine whether the invention has been
 set forth in terms of distinguishing identifying characteristics as
 evidenced by other descriptions of the invention that are sufficiently
 detailed to show that applicant was in possession of the claimed
 invention.
	+ (1) Determine whether the application as filed
	 describes the complete structure (or acts of a process) of the
	 claimed invention as a whole. The complete structure of a
	 species or embodiment typically satisfies the requirement that
	 the description be set forth "in such full, clear, concise, and
	 exact terms" to show possession of the claimed invention.
	 **[35 U.S.C.
	 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35
	 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph;
	 *cf.**Fields v. Conover,* 443 F.2d 1386, 1392, 170
	 USPQ 276, 280 (CCPA 1971) (finding a lack of written description
	 because the specification lacked the "full, clear, concise, and
	 exact written description" which is necessary to support the
	 claimed invention). If a complete structure is disclosed, the
	 written description requirement is satisfied for that species or
	 embodiment, and a rejection under **[35
	 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35
	 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, for lack of
	 written description must not be made.
	+ (2) If the application as filed does not disclose
	 the complete structure (or acts of a process) of the claimed
	 invention as a whole, determine whether the specification
	 discloses other relevant identifying characteristics sufficient
	 to describe the claimed invention in such full, clear, concise,
	 and exact terms that a skilled artisan would recognize applicant
	 was in possession of the claimed invention. For example, in the
	 biotech art, if a strong correlation has been established
	 between structure and function, one skilled in the art would be
	 able to predict with a reasonable degree of confidence the
	 structure of the claimed invention from a recitation of its
	 function. Thus, the written description requirement may be
	 satisfied through disclosure of function and minimal structure
	 when there is a well-established correlation between structure
	 and function. In contrast, without such a correlation, the
	 capability to recognize or understand the structure from the
	 mere recitation of function and minimal structure is highly
	 unlikely. In this latter case, disclosure of function alone is
	 little more than a wish for possession; it does not satisfy the
	 written description requirement. See *Eli
	 Lilly,* 119 F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at 1406 (written
	 description requirement not satisfied by merely providing "a
	 result that one might achieve if one made that invention");
	 *In re Wilder,* 736 F.2d 1516, 1521, 222
	 USPQ 369, 372-73 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (affirming a rejection for
	 lack of written description because the specification does
	 "little more than outline goals appellants hope the claimed
	 invention achieves and the problems the invention will hopefully
	 ameliorate").


 Whether the specification shows that applicant was in
 possession of the claimed invention is not a single, simple determination,
 but rather is a factual determination reached by considering a number of
 factors. Factors to be considered in determining whether there is sufficient
 evidence of possession include the level of skill and knowledge in the art,
 partial structure, physical and/or chemical properties, functional
 characteristics alone or coupled with a known or disclosed correlation
 between structure and function, and the method of making the claimed
 invention. Disclosure of any combination of such identifying characteristics
 that distinguish the claimed invention from other materials and would lead
 one of skill in the art to the conclusion that the applicant was in
 possession of the claimed species is sufficient. See *Eli
 Lilly,* 119 F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at 1406. The description
 needed to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** "varies
 with the nature and scope of the invention at issue, and with the scientific
 and technologic knowledge already in existence." *Capon v.
 Eshhar,* 418 F.3d at 1357, 76 USPQ2d at 1084. Patents and
 printed publications in the art should be relied upon to determine whether
 an art is mature and what the level of knowledge and skill is in the art. In
 most technologies which are mature, and wherein the knowledge and level of
 skill in the art is high, a written description question should not be
 raised for claims present in the application when originally filed, even if
 the specification discloses only a method of making the invention and the
 function of the invention. 
 


In contrast, for inventions in emerging and unpredictable
 technologies, or for inventions characterized by factors not reasonably
 predictable which are known to one of ordinary skill in the art, more
 evidence is required to show possession. For example, disclosure of only a
 method of making the invention and the function may not be sufficient to
 support a product claim other than a product-by-process claim. See, e.g.,
 *Fiers v. Revel,* 984 F.2d at 1169, 25 USPQ2d at 1605;
 *Amgen,* 927 F.2d at 1206, 18 USPQ2d at 1021. Where the
 process has actually been used to produce the product, the written
 description requirement for a product-by-process claim is clearly satisfied;
 however, the requirement may not be satisfied where it is not clear that the
 acts set forth in the specification can be performed, or that the product is
 produced by that process. Furthermore, disclosure of a partial structure
 without additional characterization of the product may not be sufficient to
 evidence possession of the claimed invention. See, e.g.,
 *Amgen,* 927 F.2d at 1206, 18 USPQ2d at 1021 ("A gene is
 a chemical compound, albeit a complex one, and it is well established in our
 law that conception of a chemical compound requires that the inventor be
 able to define it so as to distinguish it from other materials, and to
 describe how to obtain it. Conception does not occur unless one has a mental
 picture of the structure of the chemical, or is able to define it by its
 method of preparation, its physical or chemical properties, or whatever
 characteristics sufficiently distinguish it. It is not sufficient to define
 it solely by its principal biological property, e.g., encoding human
 erythropoietin, because an alleged conception having no more specificity
 than that is simply a wish to know the identity of any material with that
 biological property. We hold that when an inventor is unable to envision the
 detailed constitution of a gene so as to distinguish it from other
 materials, as well as a method for obtaining it, conception has not been
 achieved until reduction to practice has occurred, i.e., until after the
 gene has been isolated." (citations omitted)). In such instances the alleged
 conception fails not merely because the field is unpredictable or because of
 the general uncertainty surrounding experimental sciences, but because the
 conception is incomplete due to factual uncertainty that undermines the
 specificity of the inventor’s idea of the invention. *Burroughs
 Wellcome Co. v. Barr Labs. Inc.,* 40 F.3d 1223, 1229, 32 USPQ2d
 1915, 1920 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Reduction to practice in effect provides the
 only evidence to corroborate conception (and therefore possession) of the
 invention. *Id.*


Any claim to a species that does not meet the test
 described under at least one of (a), (b), or (c) must be rejected as lacking
 adequate written description under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 first paragraph.
 

**ii)** **For each claim drawn to a genus:** The written description requirement for a claimed genus
 may be satisfied through sufficient description of a representative number
 of species by actual reduction to practice (see i)(A) above), reduction to
 drawings (see i)(B) above), or by disclosure of relevant, identifying
 characteristics, i.e., structure or other physical and/or chemical
 properties, by functional characteristics coupled with a known or disclosed
 correlation between function and structure, or by a combination of such
 identifying characteristics, sufficient to show the applicant was in
 possession of the claimed genus (see i)(C) above). See *Eli
 Lilly,* 119 F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at 1406.
 


 A "representative number of species" means that the
 species which are adequately described are representative of the entire
 genus. Thus, when there is substantial variation within the genus, one must
 describe a sufficient variety of species to reflect the variation within the
 genus. See *AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co., KG v. Janssen
 Biotech, Inc.,* 759 F.3d 1285, 1300, 111 USPQ2d 1780, 1790 (Fed.
 Cir. 2014) (Claims directed to a functionally defined genus of antibodies
 were not supported by a disclosure that "only describe[d] one type of
 structurally similar antibodies" that "are not representative of the full
 variety or scope of the genus."). The disclosure of only one species
 encompassed within a genus adequately describes a claim directed to that
 genus only if the disclosure "indicates that the patentee has invented
 species sufficient to constitute the gen[us]." See *Enzo
 Biochem,* 323 F.3d at 966, 63 USPQ2d at 1615; *Noelle v.
 Lederman,* 355 F.3d 1343, 1350, 69 USPQ2d 1508, 1514 (Fed. Cir.
 2004) (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("[A] patentee of a biotechnological invention cannot
 necessarily claim a genus after only describing a limited number of species
 because there may be unpredictability in the results obtained from species
 other than those specifically enumerated."). "A patentee will not be deemed
 to have invented species sufficient to constitute the genus by virtue of
 having disclosed a single species when … the evidence indicates ordinary
 artisans could not predict the operability in the invention of any species
 other than the one disclosed." *In re Curtis,* 354 F.3d
 1347, 1358, 69 USPQ2d 1274, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Claims directed to PTFE
 dental floss with a friction-enhancing coating were not supported by a
 disclosure of a microcrystalline wax coating where there was no evidence in
 the disclosure or anywhere else in the record showing applicant conveyed
 that any other coating was suitable for a PTFE dental floss.) On the other
 hand, there may be situations where one species adequately supports a genus.
 See, e.g., *Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d at 1214, 211 USPQ at
 326-27 (disclosure of a single method of adheringly applying one layer to
 another was sufficient to support a generic claim to "adheringly applying"
 because one skilled in the art reading the specification would understand
 that it is unimportant how the layers are adhered, so long as they are
 adhered); *In re Herschler,* 591 F.2d 693, 697, 200 USPQ
 711, 714 (CCPA 1979) (disclosure of corticosteroid in DMSO sufficient to
 support claims drawn to a method of using a mixture of a "physiologically
 active steroid" and DMSO because "use of known chemical compounds in a
 manner auxiliary to the invention must have a corresponding written
 description only so specific as to lead one having ordinary skill in the art
 to that class of compounds. Occasionally, a functional recitation of those
 known compounds in the specification may be sufficient as that
 description."); *In re Smythe,* 480 F.2d 1376, 1383, 178
 USPQ 279, 285 (CCPA 1973) (the phrase "air or other gas which is inert to
 the liquid" was sufficient to support a claim to "inert fluid media" because
 the description of the properties and functions of the air or other gas
 segmentizing medium would suggest to a person skilled in the art that
 appellant’s invention includes the use of "inert fluid" broadly.). 
 


The Federal Circuit has explained that a specification
 cannot always support expansive claim language and satisfy the requirements
 of **[35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** "merely by clearly describing one
 embodiment of the thing claimed." *LizardTech v. Earth Resource
 Mapping, Inc.,* 424 F.3d 1336, 1346, 76 USPQ2d 1731, 1733 (Fed.
 Cir. 2005). The issue is whether a person skilled in the art would
 understand applicant to have invented, and been in possession of, the
 invention as broadly claimed. In *LizardTech,* claims to a
 generic method of making a seamless discrete wavelet transformation (DWT)
 were held invalid under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, because the specification taught only one particular method for
 making a seamless DWT and there was no evidence that the specification
 contemplated a more generic method. *Id.*; see also
 *Tronzo v. Biomet,* 156 F.3d at 1159, 47 USPQ2d at 1833
 (Fed. Cir. 1998)(holding that the disclosure of a species in a parent
 application did not provide adequate written description support for claims
 to a genus in a child application where the specification taught against
 other species). 
 


Satisfactory disclosure of a "representative number"
 depends on whether one of skill in the art would recognize that the
 applicant was in possession of the necessary common attributes or features
 possessed by the members of the genus in view of the species disclosed. For
 inventions in an unpredictable art, adequate written description of a genus
 which embraces widely variant species cannot be achieved by disclosing only
 one species within the genus. See, e.g., *Eli Lilly,*
 119 F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at 1406. Instead, the disclosure must adequately
 reflect the structural diversity of the claimed genus, either through the
 disclosure of sufficient species that are "representative of the full
 variety or scope of the genus," or by the establishment of "a reasonable
 structure-function correlation." Such correlations may be established "by
 the inventor as described in the specification," or they may be "known in
 the art at the time of the filing date." See *AbbVie,* 759
 F.3d at 1300-01, 111 USPQ2d 1780, 1790-91 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (Holding that
 claims to all human antibodies that bind IL-12 with a particular binding
 affinity rate constant (i.e., koff) were not
 adequately supported by a specification describing only a single type of
 human antibody having the claimed features because the disclosed antibody
 was not representative of other types of antibodies in the claimed genus, as
 demonstrated by the fact that other disclosed antibodies had different types
 of heavy and light chains, and shared only a 50% sequence similarity in
 their variable regions with the disclosed antibodies.). Description of a
 representative number of species does not require the description to be of
 such specificity that it would provide individual support for each species
 that the genus embraces. For example, in the molecular biology arts, if an
 applicant disclosed an amino acid sequence, it would be unnecessary to
 provide an explicit disclosure of nucleic acid sequences that encoded the
 amino acid sequence. Since the genetic code is widely known, a disclosure of
 an amino acid sequence would provide sufficient information such that one
 would accept that an applicant was in possession of the full genus of
 nucleic acids encoding a given amino acid sequence, but not necessarily any
 particular species. Cf. *In re Bell,* 991 F.2d 781, 785, 26
 USPQ2d 1529, 1532 (Fed. Cir. 1993) and *In re Baird,* 16
 F.3d 380, 382, 29 USPQ2d 1550, 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1994). If a representative
 number of adequately described species are not disclosed for a genus, the
 claim to that genus must be rejected as lacking adequate written description
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph.
 

**(b)** **New Claims, Amended Claims, or Claims Asserting Entitlement to the
 Benefit of an Earlier Priority Date or Filing Date under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120,
 365, or 386** The examiner has the initial burden of presenting evidence or
 reasoning to explain why persons skilled in the art would not recognize in the
 original disclosure a description of the invention defined by the claims. See
 *Wertheim,* 541 F.2d at 263, 191 USPQ at 97 ("[T]he PTO has
 the initial burden of presenting evidence or reasons why persons skilled in the
 art would not recognize in the disclosure a description of the invention
 defined by the claims."). However, when filing an amendment an applicant should
 show support in the original disclosure for new or amended claims. See
 **[MPEP §§
 714.02](s714.html#d0e86906)** and **[2163.06](s2163.html#d0e215023)** ("Applicant should ...
 specifically point out the support for any amendments made to the

To comply with the written description requirement of
 **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,

 **[386](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_27b56_2ab)**, each claim limitation must be expressly,
 implicitly, or inherently supported in the originally filed disclosure. When an
 explicit limitation in a claim "is not present in the written description whose
 benefit is sought it must be shown that a person of ordinary skill would have
 understood, at the time the patent application was filed, that the description
 requires that limitation." *Hyatt v. Boone,* 146 F.3d 1348,
 1353, 47 USPQ2d 1128, 1131 (Fed. Cir. 1998); see also *In re

 (Original specification for method of forming images using photosensitive
 microcapsules which describes removal of microcapsules from surface and warns

 Int’l, Inc.,* 835 F.2d 1419, 1423 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). Furthermore,
 each claim must include all elements which applicant has described as

If the originally filed disclosure does not provide support
 for each claim limitation, or if an element which applicant describes as
 essential or critical is not claimed, a new or amended claim must be rejected

 that determination, Office personnel must complete the patentability determination under
 all the relevant statutory provisions of title 35 of the U.S. Code.
 


Once Office personnel have concluded analysis of the claimed invention
 under all the statutory provisions, including **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 **[102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, they should review all the
 proposed rejections and their bases to confirm their correctness. Only then should any
 rejection be imposed in an Office action. The Office action should clearly communicate
 the findings, conclusions, and reasons which support them. When possible, the Office
 action should offer helpful suggestions on how to overcome rejections.
 

***A.******For Each Claim Lacking Written Description Support, Reject the Claim
 Under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, for Lack of
 Adequate Written Description***A description as filed is presumed to be adequate, unless or until
 sufficient evidence or reasoning to the contrary has been presented by the examiner
 to rebut the presumption. See, e.g., *In re Marzocchi,* 439 F.2d
 220, 224, 169 USPQ 367, 370 (CCPA 1971). The examiner, therefore, must have a
 reasonable basis to challenge the adequacy of the written description. The examiner
 has the initial burden of presenting by a preponderance of evidence why a person
 skilled in the art would not recognize in an applicant’s disclosure a description of
 the invention defined by the claims. *Wertheim,* 541 F.2d at 263,
 191 USPQ at 97. In rejecting a claim, the examiner must set forth express findings of
 fact regarding the above analysis which support the lack of written description
 conclusion. These findings should:
 


* (A) Identify the claim limitation at issue; and
* (B) Establish a *prima facie* case by providing
 reasons why a person skilled in the art at the time the application was filed
 would not have recognized that the inventor was in possession of the invention
 as claimed in view of the disclosure of the application as filed. A general
 allegation of "unpredictability in the art" is not a sufficient reason to
 support a rejection for lack of adequate written description.


 When appropriate, suggest amendments to the claims which can be
 supported by the application’s written description, being mindful of the prohibition
 against the addition of new matter in the claims or description. See
 *Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d at 1214, 211 USPQ at 326.

 view of the record as a whole, including amendments, arguments, and any evidence
 submitted by applicant. If the whole record now demonstrates that the written

 further showings submitted by applicant in the reply. When a rejection is maintained,
 any affidavits relevant to the **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, written description requirement,
 must be thoroughly analyzed and discussed in the next Office action. See *In
 re Alton,* 76 F.3d 1168, 1176, 37 USPQ2d 1578, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
 



# 2163.01 Support for the Claimed Subject Matter in
 Disclosure [R-11.2013]


A written description requirement issue generally involves the question
 of whether the subject matter of a claim is supported by [conforms to] the disclosure of
 an application as filed. If the examiner concludes that the claimed subject matter is
 not supported [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection
 of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, or denial of the benefit of the filing date of a previously filed
 application. The claim should not be rejected or objected to on the ground of new
 matter. As framed by the court in *In re Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d 1212, 211
 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981), the concept of new matter is properly employed as a basis for
 objection to amendments to the abstract, specification or drawings attempting to add new
 disclosure to that originally presented. While the test or analysis of description
 requirement and new matter issues is the same, the examining procedure and statutory
 basis for addressing these issues differ. See **[MPEP § 2163.06](s2163.html#d0e215023)**.
 




# 2163.02 Standard for Determining Compliance With the Written
 Description Requirement [R-11.2013]


The courts have described the essential question to be addressed in a
 description requirement issue in a variety of ways. An objective standard for
 determining compliance with the written description requirement is, "does the
 description clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that he or
 she invented what is claimed." *In re**Gosteli,* 872 F.2d 1008, 1012, 10 USPQ2d 1614, 1618 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 Under *Vas-Cath, Inc.**v.* *Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1563-64, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (Fed. Cir.
 1991), to satisfy the written description requirement, an applicant must convey with
 reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, he or
 she was in possession of the invention, and that the invention, in that context, is
 whatever is now claimed. The test for sufficiency of support in a parent application is
 whether the disclosure of the application relied upon "reasonably conveys to the artisan
 that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter."
 *Ralston Purina Co.**v.**Far-Mar-Co., Inc.,* 772 F.2d 1570, 1575, 227 USPQ 177, 179 (Fed. Cir.
 1985) (quoting *In re**Kaslow,* 707 F.2d 1366, 1375, 217 USPQ 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir.
 1983)).
 


Whenever the issue arises, the fundamental factual inquiry is whether
 the specification conveys with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as
 of the filing date sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now claimed.
 See, e.g., *Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1563-64, 19
 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 1991). An applicant shows possession of the claimed
 invention by describing the claimed invention with all of its limitations using such
 descriptive means as words, structures, figures, diagrams, and formulas that fully set
 forth the claimed invention. *Lockwood v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,* 107 F.3d
 1565, 1572, 41 USPQ2d 1961, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Possession may be shown in a variety
 of ways including description of an actual reduction to practice, or by showing that the
 invention was "ready for patenting" such as by the disclosure of drawings or structural
 chemical formulas that show that the invention was complete, or by describing
 distinguishing identifying characteristics sufficient to show that the applicant was in
 possession of the claimed invention. See, e.g., *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs.,
 Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 68, 119 S.Ct. 304, 312, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647 (1998);
 *Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3d 1559, 1568, 43
 USPQ2d 1398, 1406 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharm.,* 927
 F.2d 1200, 1206, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (one must define a compound by
 "whatever characteristics sufficiently distinguish it").
 


The subject matter of the claim need not be described literally (i.e.,
 using the same terms or *in haec verba*) in order for the disclosure to
 satisfy the description requirement. If a claim is amended to include subject matter,
 limitations, or terminology not present in the application as filed, involving a
 departure from, addition to, or deletion from the disclosure of the application as
 filed, the examiner should conclude that the claimed subject matter is not described in
 that application. This conclusion will result in the rejection of the claims affected
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph - description requirement, or denial of the benefit of the filing date of a
 previously filed application, as appropriate.
 


See **[MPEP
 § 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** for examination guidelines pertaining to the written
 description requirement.
 




# 2163.03 Typical Circumstances Where Adequate Written Description Issue
 Arises [R-10.2019]


A description requirement issue can arise in a number of different
 circumstances where it must be determined whether the subject matter of a claim is
 supported in an application as filed. See **[MPEP § 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** for examination guidelines
 pertaining to the written description requirement. Most typically, the issue will arise
 in the following circumstances: 
 

**I.** **AMENDMENT AFFECTING A CLAIM**An amendment to the claims or the addition of a new claim must be
 supported by the description of the invention in the application as filed.
 *In re**Wright,* 866 F.2d 422, 9 USPQ2d 1649 (Fed. Cir. 1989). An amendment
 to the specification (e.g., a change in the definition of a term used both in the
 specification and claim) may indirectly affect a claim even though no actual
 amendment is made to the claim. 
 

**II.** **RELIANCE ON FILING DATE OF PARENT APPLICATION UNDER 35 U.S.C. 120**Under **[35 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, the claims in a
 U.S. application are entitled to the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed
 U.S. application if the subject matter of the claim is disclosed in the manner
 provided by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph in the earlier filed
 application. See, e.g., *Tronzo v. Biomet, Inc.,* 156 F.3d 1154, 47
 USPQ2d 1829 (Fed. Cir. 1998); *In re**Scheiber,* 587 F.2d 59, 199 USPQ 782 (CCPA 1978).
 

**III.** **RELIANCE ON PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. 119**Under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a) or (e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, the
 claims in a U.S. application are entitled to the benefit of a foreign priority date
 or the filing date of a provisional application if the corresponding foreign
 application or provisional application supports the claims in the manner required by
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. *In re**Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 1200, 26 USPQ2d 1600, 1603 (Fed. Cir.
 1993);  *Kawai**v.**Metlesics,* 480 F.2d 880, 178 USPQ 158 (CCPA 1973); *In
 re**Gosteli,* 872 F.2d 1008, 10 USPQ2d 1614 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 

**IV.** **SUPPORT FOR A CLAIM CORRESPONDING TO A COUNT IN AN INTERFERENCE**In an interference proceeding, the claim corresponding to a count
 must be supported by the specification in the manner provided by **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. *Fields v. Conover,* 443 F.2d 1386, 170 USPQ 276 (CCPA
 1971) (A broad generic disclosure to a class of compounds was not a sufficient
 written description of a specific compound within the class.). Furthermore, when a
 party to an interference seeks the benefit of an earlier-filed U.S. patent
 application, the earlier application must meet the requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph for the subject matter of the count. *Hyatt v. Boone,* 146
 F.3d 1348, 1352, 47 USPQ2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1998).
 

**V.** **ORIGINAL CLAIM NOT SUFFICIENTLY
 DESCRIBED**While there is a presumption that an adequate written
 description of the claimed invention is present in the specification as filed,
 *In re Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 262, 191 USPQ 90, 96 (CCPA 1976),
 a question as to whether a specification provides an adequate written description may
 arise in the context of an original claim. An original claim may lack written
 description support when (1) the claim defines the invention in functional language
 specifying a desired result but the disclosure fails to sufficiently identify how the
 function is performed or the result is achieved or (2) a broad genus claim is
 presented but the disclosure only describes a narrow species with no evidence that
 the genus is contemplated. See *Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly &
 Co.,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1349-50 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (en banc). The written
 description requirement is not necessarily met when the claim language appears
 *in ipsis verbis* in the specification. "Even if a claim is
 supported by the specification, the language of the specification, to the extent
 possible, must describe the claimed invention so that one skilled in the art can
 recognize what is claimed. The appearance of mere indistinct words in a specification
 or a claim, even an original claim, does not necessarily satisfy that
 requirement."*Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe, Inc.,* 323 F.3d
 956, 968, 63 USPQ2d 1609, 1616 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
 

**VI.** **INDEFINITENESS REJECTION OF A MEANS- (OR STEP-) PLUS-FUNCTION
 LIMITATION**A claim limitation expressed in means- (or step-)
 plus-function language "shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure,
 material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof."
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. If the specification fails to disclose sufficient corresponding structure,
 materials, or acts that perform the entire claimed function, then the claim
 limitation is indefinite because the applicant has in effect failed to particularly
 point out and distinctly claim the invention as required by **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d 1189, 1195, 29 USPQ2d
 1845, 1850 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc). Such a limitation also lacks an adequate
 written description as required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, because an indefinite, unbounded
 functional limitation would cover all ways of performing a function and indicate that
 the inventor has not provided sufficient disclosure to show possession of the
 invention. See also **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**.
 




# 2163.04 Burden on the Examiner with Regard to the Written Description
 Requirement [R-11.2013]


The inquiry into whether the description requirement is met must be
 determined on a case-by-case basis and is a question of fact. *In re**Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 262, 191 USPQ 90, 96 (CCPA 1976). A
 description as filed is presumed to be adequate, unless or until sufficient evidence or
 reasoning to the contrary has been presented by the examiner to rebut the presumption.
 See, e.g., *In re Marzocchi,* 439 F.2d 220, 224, 169 USPQ 367, 370
 (CCPA 1971). The examiner, therefore, must have a reasonable basis to challenge the
 adequacy of the written description. The examiner has the initial burden of presenting
 by a preponderance of evidence why a person skilled in the art would not recognize in an
 applicant’s disclosure a description of the invention defined by the claims.
 *Wertheim,* 541 F.2d at 263, 191 USPQ at 97. 
 

**I.** **STATEMENT OF REJECTION REQUIREMENTS**In rejecting a claim, the examiner must set forth express findings
 of fact which support the lack of written description conclusion (see
 **[MPEP §
 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** for examination guidelines pertaining to the written
 description requirement). These findings should:
 


* (A) Identify the claim limitation(s) at issue; and
* (B) Establish a *prima facie* case by providing
 reasons why a person skilled in the art at the time the application was filed
 would not have recognized that the inventor was in possession of the invention
 as claimed in view of the disclosure of the application as filed. A general
 allegation of "unpredictability in the art" is not a sufficient reason to
 support a rejection for lack of adequate written description. A simple
 statement such as "Applicant has not pointed out where the new (or amended)
 claim is supported, nor does there appear to be a written description of the
 claim limitation ‘\_\_\_\_’ in the application as filed." may be sufficient where
 the claim is a new or amended claim, the support for the limitation is not
 apparent, and applicant has not pointed out where the limitation is
 supported.
 


See *Hyatt v. Dudas,* 492 F.3d 1365, 1370, 83
 USPQ2d 1373, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "**[[MPEP] §
 2163.04](s2163.html#d0e214731)** [subsection] (I)(B) as written is a lawful
 formulation of the *prima facie* standard for a lack of
 written description rejection.").


When appropriate, suggest amendments to the claims which can be
 supported by the application’s written description, being mindful of the prohibition
 against the addition of new matter in the claims or description. See
 *Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d at 1214, 211 USPQ at 326.
 

**II.** **RESPONSE TO APPLICANT’S REPLY**Upon reply by applicant, before repeating any rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 1,
 for lack of written description, review the basis for the rejection in view of the
 record as a whole, including amendments, arguments, and any evidence submitted by
 applicant. If the whole record now demonstrates that the written description
 requirement is satisfied, do not repeat the rejection in the next Office action. If
 the record still does not demonstrate that the written description is adequate to
 support the claim(s), repeat the rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 1,
 fully respond to applicant’s rebuttal arguments, and properly treat any further
 showings submitted by applicant in the reply. When a rejection is maintained, any
 affidavits relevant to the **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 1, written description requirement, must be
 thoroughly analyzed and discussed in the next Office action. See *In re
 Alton,* 76 F.3d 1168, 1176, 37 USPQ2d 1578, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
 




# 2163.05 Changes to the Scope of Claims [R-07.2015]


The failure to meet the written description requirement of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, commonly arises when the claims are changed after filing to either broaden or
 narrow the breadth of the claim limitations, or to alter a numerical range limitation or
 to use claim language which is not synonymous with the terminology used in the original
 disclosure. To comply with the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 1, or
 to be entitled to an earlier priority date or filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**,
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, or **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, each claim limitation must
 be expressly, implicitly, or inherently supported in the originally filed disclosure.
 See **[MPEP §
 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** for examination guidelines pertaining to the written
 description requirement.
 

**I.** **BROADENING CLAIM*** 

***A.******Omission of a Limitation***Under certain circumstances, omission of a limitation can raise
 an issue regarding whether the inventor had possession of a broader, more generic
 invention. See, e.g., *Gentry Gallery, Inc. v. Berkline Corp.,*
 134 F.3d 1473, 45 USPQ2d 1498 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (claims to a sectional sofa
 comprising, *inter alia,* a console and a control means were held
 invalid for failing to satisfy the written description requirement where the
 claims were broadened by removing the location of the control means.);
 *Johnson Worldwide Assoc. v. Zebco Corp.,* 175 F.3d 985, 993,
 50 USPQ2d 1607, 1613 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (In *Gentry Gallery,* the
 "court’s determination that the patent disclosure did not support a broad meaning
 for the disputed claim terms was premised on clear statements in the written
 description that described the location of a claim element--the ‘control
 means’--as ‘the only possible location’ and that variations were ‘outside the
 stated purpose of the invention.’ *Gentry Gallery,* 134 F.3d at
 1479, 45 USPQ2d at 1503. *Gentry Gallery,* then, considers the
 situation where the patent’s disclosure makes crystal clear that a particular
 (i.e., narrow) understanding of a claim term is an ‘essential element of [the
 inventor’s] invention.’"); **Tronzo v. Biomet*,* 156 F.3d at 1158-59, 47 USPQ2d
 at 1833 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (claims to generic cup shape were not entitled to filing
 date of parent application which disclosed "conical cup" in view of the disclosure
 of the parent application stating the advantages and importance of the conical
 shape.); *In re Wilder,* 736 F.2d 1516, 222 USPQ 369 (Fed. Cir.
 1984) (reissue claim omitting "in synchronism" limitation with respect to scanning
 means and indexing means was not supported by the original patent’s disclosure in
 such a way as to indicate possession, as of the original filing date, of that
 generic invention.). 
 


A claim that omits an element which applicant describes as an
 essential or critical feature of the invention originally disclosed does not
 comply with the written description requirement. See *Gentry
 Gallery,* 134 F.3d at 1480, 45 USPQ2d at 1503; *In re
 Sus,* 306 F.2d 494, 504, 134 USPQ 301, 309 (CCPA 1962) ("[O]ne skilled
 in this art would not be taught by the written description of the invention in the
 specification that any ‘aryl or substituted aryl radical’ would be suitable for
 the purposes of the invention but rather that only certain aryl radicals and
 certain specifically substituted aryl radicals [i.e., aryl azides] would be
 suitable for such purposes.") (emphasis in original). Compare *In re
 Peters,* 723 F.2d 891, 221 USPQ 952 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (In a reissue
 application, a claim to a display device was broadened by removing the limitations
 directed to the specific tapered shape of the tips without violating the written
 description requirement. The shape limitation was considered to be unnecessary
 since the specification, as filed, did not describe the tapered shape as essential
 or critical to the operation or patentability of the claim.). A claim which omits
 matter disclosed to be essential to the invention as described in the
 specification or in other statements of record may also be subject to rejection
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para.

***B.******Addition of Generic Claim***The written description requirement for a claimed genus may be
 satisfied through sufficient description of a representative number of species. A
 "representative number of species" means that the species which are adequately
 described are representative of the entire genus. Thus, when there is substantial
 variation within the genus, one must describe a sufficient variety of species to
 reflect the variation within the genus. See *AbbVie Deutschland GmbH &
 Co., KG v. Janssen Biotech, Inc.,* 759 F.3d 1285, 1300, 111 USPQ2d
 1780, 1790 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (Claims directed to a functionally defined genus of
 antibodies were not supported by a disclosure that "only describe[d] one type of
 structurally similar antibodies" that "are not representative of the full variety
 or scope of the genus."). The disclosure of only one species encompassed within a
 genus adequately describes a claim directed to that genus only if the disclosure
 "indicates that the patentee has invented species sufficient to constitute the
 gen[us]." See *Enzo Biochem,* 323 F.3d at 966, 63 USPQ2d at 1615.
 "A patentee will not be deemed to have invented species sufficient to constitute
 the genus by virtue of having disclosed a single species when … the evidence
 indicates ordinary artisans could not predict the operability in the invention of
 any species other than the one disclosed." *In re Curtis,* 354
 F.3d 1347, 1358, 69 USPQ2d 1274, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Claims directed to PTFE
 dental floss with a friction-enhancing coating were not supported by a disclosure
 of a microcrystalline wax coating where there was no evidence in the disclosure or
 anywhere else in the record showing applicant conveyed that any other coating was
 suitable for a PTFE dental floss.) On the other hand, there may be situations
 where one species adequately supports a genus. See, e.g., *In re
 Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d 1212, 1214, 211 USPQ 323, 326-27 (CCPA 1981)
 (disclosure of a single method of adheringly applying one layer to another was
 sufficient to support a generic claim to "adheringly applying" because one skilled
 in the art reading the specification would understand that it is unimportant how
 the layers are adhered, so long as they are adhered); *In re
 Herschler,* 591 F.2d 693, 697, 200 USPQ 711, 714 (CCPA 1979)
 (disclosure of corticosteriod in DMSO sufficient to support claims drawn to a
 method of using a mixture of a "physiologically active steroid" and DMSO because
 "use of known chemical compounds in a manner auxiliary to the invention must have
 a corresponding written description only so specific as to lead one having
 ordinary skill in the art to that class of compounds. Occasionally, a functional
 recitation of those known compounds in the specification may be sufficient as that
 description."); *In re Smythe,* 480 F.2d 1376, 1383, 178 USPQ
 279, 285 (CCPA 1973) (the phrase "air or other gas which is inert to the liquid"
 was sufficient to support a claim to "inert fluid media" because the description
 of the properties and functions of the air or other gas segmentizing medium would
 suggest to a person skilled in the art that appellant’s invention includes the use
 of "inert fluid" broadly.). However, in *Tronzo v. Biomet,* 156
 F.3d 1154, 1159, 47 USPQ2d 1829, 1833 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the disclosure of a
 species in the parent application did not suffice to provide written description
 support for the genus in the child application where the specification taught
 against other species. See also *In re Gosteli,* 872 F.2d 1008,
 10 USPQ2d 1614 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (generic and subgeneric claims in the U.S.
 application were not entitled to the benefit of foreign priority where the foreign
 application disclosed only two of the species encompassed by the broad generic
 claim and the subgeneric Markush claim that encompassed 21 compounds). 
 

**II.** **NARROWING OR SUBGENERIC CLAIM**The introduction of claim changes which involve narrowing the claims
 by introducing elements or limitations which are not supported by the as-filed
 disclosure is a violation of the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. See, e.g., *Fujikawa v. Wattanasin,* 93 F.3d 1559, 1571,
 39 USPQ2d 1895, 1905 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (a "laundry list" disclosure of every possible
 moiety does not constitute a written description of every species in a genus because
 it would not "reasonably lead" those skilled in the art to any particular species);
 *In re Ruschig,* 379 F.2d 990, 995, 154 USPQ 118, 123 (CCPA 1967)
 ("*If* n-propylamine had been used in making the compound instead
 of n-butylamine, the compound of claim 13 would have resulted. Appellants submit to
 us, as they did to the board, an imaginary specific example patterned on specific
 example 6 by which the above butyl compound is made so that we can see what a simple
 change would have resulted in a specific supporting disclosure being present in the
 present specification. The trouble is that there is no such disclosure, easy though
 it is to imagine it.") (emphasis in original); *Rozbicki v. Chiang,*
 590 Fed.App’x 990, 996 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (non-precedential) (The court found that
 patentee, "while attempting to obtain the broadest claim language possible during
 prosecution, cannot now improperly narrow its language by importing limitations not
 supported by the claim language or written description."). In *Ex
 parte**Ohshiro,* 14 USPQ2d 1750 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989), the
 Board affirmed the rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph,
 of claims to an internal combustion engine which recited "at least one of said piston
 and said cylinder (head) having a recessed channel." The Board held that the
 application which disclosed a cylinder head with a recessed channel and a piston
 without a recessed channel did not specifically disclose the "species" of a channeled
 piston.
 


While these and other cases find that recitation of an undisclosed
 species may violate the description requirement, a change involving subgeneric
 terminology may or may not be acceptable. Applicant was not entitled to the benefit
 of a parent filing date when the claim was directed to a subgenus (a specified range
 of molecular weight ratios) where the parent application contained a generic
 disclosure and a specific example that fell within the recited range because the
 court held that subgenus range was not described in the parent application.
 *In re**Lukach,* 442 F.2d 967, 169 USPQ 795 (CCPA 1971). On the other hand,
 in *Ex parte**Sorenson,* 3 USPQ2d 1462 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987), the
 subgeneric language of "aliphatic carboxylic acid" and "aryl carboxylic acid" did not
 violate the written description requirement because species falling within each
 subgenus were disclosed as well as the generic carboxylic acid. See also *In
 re**Smith,* 458 F.2d 1389, 1395, 173 USPQ 679, 683 (CCPA 1972)
 ("Whatever may be the viability of an inductive-deductive approach to arriving at a
 claimed subgenus, it cannot be said that such a subgenus is
 necessarily described by a genus encompassing it and a species upon which it reads."
 (emphasis added)). Each case must be decided on its own facts in terms of what is
 reasonably communicated to those skilled in the art. *In re**Wilder,* 736 F.2d 1516, 1520, 222 USPQ 369, 372 (Fed. Cir. 1984).
 
 

**III.** **RANGE LIMITATIONS**With respect to changing numerical range limitations, the analysis
 must take into account which ranges one skilled in the art would consider inherently
 supported by the discussion in the original disclosure. In the decision in
 *In re**Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976), the ranges
 described in the original specification included a range of "25%- 60%" and specific
 examples of "36%" and "50%." A corresponding new claim limitation to "at least 35%"
 did not meet the description requirement because the phrase "at least" had no upper
 limit and caused the claim to read literally on embodiments outside the "25% to 60%"
 range, however a limitation to "between 35% and 60%" did meet the description
 requirement.
 


See also *Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Faulding Inc.,*
 230 F.3d 1320, 1328, 56 USPQ2d 1481, 1487 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("[T]he specification does
 not clearly disclose to the skilled artisan that the inventors... considered the...
 ratio to be part of their invention.... There is therefore no force to Purdue’s
 argument that the written description requirement was satisfied because the
 disclosure revealed a broad invention from which the [later-filed] claims carved out
 a patentable portion"). Compare *Union Oil of Cal. v. Atl. Richfield
 Co.,* 208 F.3d 989, 997, 54 USPQ2d 1227, 1232-33 (Fed. Cir. 2000)
 (Description in terms of ranges of chemical properties which work in combination with
 ranges of other chemical properties to produce an automotive gasoline that reduces
 emissions was found to provide an adequate written description even though the exact
 chemical components of each combination were not disclosed and the specification did
 not disclose any distinct embodiments corresponding to any claim at issue. "[T]he
 Patent Act and this court’s case law require only sufficient description to show one
 of skill in the . . . art that the inventor possessed the claimed invention at the
 time of filing.").
 




# 2163.06 Relationship of Written Description Requirement to New
 Matter [R-11.2013]


Lack of written description is an issue that generally arises with
 respect to the subject matter of a claim. If an applicant amends or attempts to amend
 the abstract, specification or drawings of an application, an issue of new matter will
 arise if the content of the amendment is not described in the application as filed.
 Stated another way, information contained in any one of the specification, claims or
 drawings of the application as filed may be added to any other part of the application
 without introducing new matter.
 


There are two statutory provisions that prohibit the introduction of
 new matter. The first provision is **[35 U.S.C. 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)**, which provides that
 no amendment shall introduce new matter into the disclosure of the invention. The second
 provision is **[35 U.S.C.
 251](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345)**, which provides that no new matter shall be introduced into
 the application for reissue.
 

**I.** **TREATMENT OF NEW MATTER**If new subject matter is added to the disclosure, whether it be in
 the abstract, the specification, or the drawings, the examiner should object to the
 introduction of new matter under **[35 U.S.C. 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)** or
 **[251](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345)** as appropriate, and require applicant to cancel the new
 matter. If new matter is added to the claims, the examiner should reject the claims
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph - written description requirement. *In re Rasmussen,* 650
 F.2d 1212, 211 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981). The examiner should still consider the subject
 matter added to the claim in making rejections based on prior art since the new
 matter rejection may be overcome by applicant.
 


When the claims have not been amended, *per se,*
 but the specification has been amended to add new matter, a rejection of the claims
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, should be made whenever any of the claim limitations are affected by the
 added material.
 


When an amendment is filed in reply to an objection or rejection
 based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, a study of the entire application is often necessary to determine whether
 or not "new matter" is involved. Applicant should therefore specifically point out
 the support for any amendments made to the disclosure.
 

**II.** **REVIEW OF NEW MATTER OBJECTIONS AND/OR REJECTIONS**A rejection of claims is reviewable by the Patent Trial and Appeal
 Board, whereas an objection and requirement to delete new matter is subject to
 supervisory review by petition under **[37 CFR 1.181](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324913)**. If both the claims
 and specification contain new matter either directly or indirectly, and there has
 been both a rejection and objection by the examiner, the issue becomes appealable and
 should not be decided by petition.
 

**III.** **CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER NOT DISCLOSED IN REMAINDER OF SPECIFICATION**The claims as filed in the original specification are part of the
 disclosure and therefore, if an application as originally filed contains a claim
 disclosing material not disclosed in the remainder of the specification, the
 applicant may amend the specification to include the claimed subject matter.
 *In re**Benno,* 768 F.2d 1340, 226 USPQ 683 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Form
 paragraph **[7.44](#fp7.44)** may be used where originally claimed subject
 matter lacks proper antecedent basis in the specification. See **[MPEP §
 608.01(o)](s608.html#d0e46173)**.
 




# 2163.07 Amendments to Application Which Are Supported in the Original
 Description [R-08.2017]


Amendments to an application which are supported in the original
 description are NOT new matter.
 

**I.** **REPHRASING**Mere rephrasing of a passage does not constitute new matter.
 Accordingly, a rewording of a passage where the same meaning remains intact is
 permissible. *In re Anderson,* 471 F.2d 1237, 176 USPQ 331 (CCPA
 1973). The mere inclusion of dictionary or art recognized definitions known at the
 time of filing an application may not be considered new matter. If there are multiple
 definitions for a term and a definition is added to the application, it must be clear
 from the application as filed that applicant intended a particular definition, in
 order to avoid an issue of new matter and/or lack of written description. See, e.g.,
 *Schering Corp. v. Amgen, Inc.,* 222 F.3d 1347, 1352-53, 55
 USPQ2d 1650, 1654 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In *Schering,* the original
 disclosure was drawn to recombinant DNA molecules and used the term "leukocyte
 interferon." Shortly after the filing date, a scientific committee abolished the term
 in favor of "IFN-(a)," since the latter term more specifically identified a
 particular polypeptide and since the committee found that leukocytes also produced
 other types of interferon. The court held that the subsequent amendment to the
 specification and claims substituting the term "IFN-(a)" for "leukocyte interferon"
 merely renamed the invention and did not constitute new matter. The claims were
 limited to cover only the interferon subtype coded for by the inventor’s original
 deposits.
 

**II.** **OBVIOUS ERRORS**An amendment to correct an obvious error does not constitute new
 matter where one skilled in the art would not only recognize the existence of error
 in the specification, but also the appropriate correction. *In re**Oda,* 443 F.2d 1200, 170 USPQ 268 (CCPA 1971).
 


Where a foreign priority document under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**
 is of record in the U.S. application file, applicant may not rely on the disclosure
 of that document to support correction of an error in the pending U.S. application.
 *Ex parte**Bondiou,* 132 USPQ 356 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1961). This
 prohibition applies regardless of the language of the foreign priority documents
 because a claim for priority is simply a claim for the benefit of an earlier filing
 date for subject matter that is common to two or more applications, and does not
 serve to incorporate the content of the priority document in the application in which
 the claim for priority is made. This prohibition does not apply where the U.S.
 application explicitly incorporates the foreign priority document by reference. For
 applications filed on or after September 21, 2004, where all or a portion of the
 specification or drawing(s) is inadvertently omitted from the U.S. application, a
 claim under **[37
 CFR 1.55](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e319217)** for priority of a prior-filed foreign application that
 is present on the filing date of the application is considered an incorporation by
 reference of the prior-filed foreign application as to the inadvertently omitted
 portion of the specification or drawing(s), subject to the conditions and
 requirements of **[37
 CFR 1.57(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319490)**. See **[37 CFR 1.57(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319490)** and
 **[MPEP §
 217](s217.html#ch200_d1ff72_27f9d_2c9)**.
 


Where a U.S. application as originally filed was in a non-English
 language and an English translation thereof was subsequently submitted pursuant to
 **[37 CFR
 1.52(d)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e318327)**, if there is an error in the English translation,
 applicant may rely on the disclosure of the originally filed non-English language
 U.S. application to support correction of an error in the English translation
 document.
 



# 2163.07(a) Inherent Function, Theory, or Advantage [R-08.2017]


By disclosing in a patent application a device that inherently
 performs a function or has a property, operates according to a theory or has an
 advantage, a patent application necessarily discloses that function, theory or
 advantage, even though it says nothing explicit concerning it. The application may
 later be amended to recite the function, theory or advantage without introducing
 prohibited new matter. *In re**Reynolds,* 443 F.2d 384, 170 USPQ 94 (CCPA 1971); *In
 re**Smythe,* 480 F. 2d 1376, 178 USPQ 279 (CCPA 1973); *Yeda
 Research and Dev. Co. v. Abbott GMBH & Co.,* 837 F.3d 1341, 120
 USPQ2d 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("Under the doctrine of inherent disclosure, when a
 specification describes an invention that has certain undisclosed yet inherent
 properties, that specification serves as adequate written description to support a
 subsequent patent application that explicitly recites the invention’s inherent
 properties." (citing *Kennecott Corp. v. Kyocera Int’l, Inc.,* 835
 F.2d 1419, 1423 (Fed. Cir. 1987))). "To establish inherency, the extrinsic evidence
 ‘must make clear that the missing descriptive matter is necessarily present in the
 thing described in the reference, and that it would be so recognized by persons of
 ordinary skill. Inherency, however, may not be established by probabilities or
 possibilities. The mere fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of
 circumstances is not sufficient.’" *In re Robertson,* 169 F.3d 743,
 745, 49 USPQ2d 1949, 1950-51 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted).
 




# 2163.07(b) Incorporation by Reference [R-11.2013]


Instead of repeating some information contained in another document,
 an application may attempt to incorporate the content of another document or part
 thereof by reference to the document in the text of the specification. The
 information incorporated is as much a part of the application as filed as if the text
 was repeated in the application, and should be treated as part of the text of the
 application as filed. Replacing the identified material incorporated by reference
 with the actual text is not new matter. See **[37 CFR 1.57](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319490)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 608.01(p)](s608.html#d0e46258)** for Office policy regarding incorporation by
 reference. See **[MPEP
 § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)** for the impact of incorporation by reference on the
 determination of whether applicant has complied with the requirements of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph when **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph is invoked.

# 2163.01 Support for the Claimed Subject Matter in
 Disclosure [R-11.2013]


A written description requirement issue generally involves the question
 of whether the subject matter of a claim is supported by [conforms to] the disclosure of
 an application as filed. If the examiner concludes that the claimed subject matter is
 not supported [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection
 of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, or denial of the benefit of the filing date of a previously filed
 application. The claim should not be rejected or objected to on the ground of new
 matter. As framed by the court in *In re Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d 1212, 211
 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981), the concept of new matter is properly employed as a basis for
 objection to amendments to the abstract, specification or drawings attempting to add new
 disclosure to that originally presented. While the test or analysis of description
 requirement and new matter issues is the same, the examining procedure and statutory
 basis for addressing these issues differ. See **[MPEP § 2163.06](s2163.html#d0e215023)**.
 


, 
# 2163.02 Standard for Determining Compliance With the Written
 Description Requirement [R-11.2013]


The courts have described the essential question to be addressed in a
 description requirement issue in a variety of ways. An objective standard for
 determining compliance with the written description requirement is, "does the
 description clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that he or
 she invented what is claimed." *In re**Gosteli,* 872 F.2d 1008, 1012, 10 USPQ2d 1614, 1618 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 Under *Vas-Cath, Inc.**v.* *Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1563-64, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (Fed. Cir.
 1991), to satisfy the written description requirement, an applicant must convey with
 reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, he or
 she was in possession of the invention, and that the invention, in that context, is
 whatever is now claimed. The test for sufficiency of support in a parent application is
 whether the disclosure of the application relied upon "reasonably conveys to the artisan
 that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter."
 *Ralston Purina Co.**v.**Far-Mar-Co., Inc.,* 772 F.2d 1570, 1575, 227 USPQ 177, 179 (Fed. Cir.
 1985) (quoting *In re**Kaslow,* 707 F.2d 1366, 1375, 217 USPQ 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir.
 1983)).
 


Whenever the issue arises, the fundamental factual inquiry is whether
 the specification conveys with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as
 of the filing date sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now claimed.
 See, e.g., *Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1563-64, 19
 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 1991). An applicant shows possession of the claimed
 invention by describing the claimed invention with all of its limitations using such
 descriptive means as words, structures, figures, diagrams, and formulas that fully set
 forth the claimed invention. *Lockwood v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,* 107 F.3d
 1565, 1572, 41 USPQ2d 1961, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Possession may be shown in a variety
 of ways including description of an actual reduction to practice, or by showing that the
 invention was "ready for patenting" such as by the disclosure of drawings or structural
 chemical formulas that show that the invention was complete, or by describing
 distinguishing identifying characteristics sufficient to show that the applicant was in
 possession of the claimed invention. See, e.g., *Pfaff v. Wells Elecs.,
 Inc.,* 525 U.S. 55, 68, 119 S.Ct. 304, 312, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647 (1998);
 *Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3d 1559, 1568, 43
 USPQ2d 1398, 1406 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharm.,* 927
 F.2d 1200, 1206, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (one must define a compound by
 "whatever characteristics sufficiently distinguish it").
 


The subject matter of the claim need not be described literally (i.e.,
 using the same terms or *in haec verba*) in order for the disclosure to
 satisfy the description requirement. If a claim is amended to include subject matter,
 limitations, or terminology not present in the application as filed, involving a
 departure from, addition to, or deletion from the disclosure of the application as
 filed, the examiner should conclude that the claimed subject matter is not described in
 that application. This conclusion will result in the rejection of the claims affected
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph - description requirement, or denial of the benefit of the filing date of a
 previously filed application, as appropriate.

# 2163.03 Typical Circumstances Where Adequate Written Description Issue
 Arises [R-10.2019]


A description requirement issue can arise in a number of different
 circumstances where it must be determined whether the subject matter of a claim is
 supported in an application as filed. See **[MPEP § 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** for examination guidelines
 pertaining to the written description requirement. Most typically, the issue will arise
 in the following circumstances: 
 

**I.** **AMENDMENT AFFECTING A CLAIM**An amendment to the claims or the addition of a new claim must be
 supported by the description of the invention in the application as filed.
 *In re**Wright,* 866 F.2d 422, 9 USPQ2d 1649 (Fed. Cir. 1989). An amendment
 to the specification (e.g., a change in the definition of a term used both in the
 specification and claim) may indirectly affect a claim even though no actual
 amendment is made to the claim. 
 

**II.** **RELIANCE ON FILING DATE OF PARENT APPLICATION UNDER 35 U.S.C. 120**Under **[35 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, the claims in a
 U.S. application are entitled to the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed
 U.S. application if the subject matter of the claim is disclosed in the manner
 provided by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph in the earlier filed
 application. See, e.g., *Tronzo v. Biomet, Inc.,* 156 F.3d 1154, 47
 USPQ2d 1829 (Fed. Cir. 1998); *In re**Scheiber,* 587 F.2d 59, 199 USPQ 782 (CCPA 1978).
 

**III.** **RELIANCE ON PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. 119**Under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a) or (e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, the
 claims in a U.S. application are entitled to the benefit of a foreign priority date
 or the filing date of a provisional application if the corresponding foreign
 application or provisional application supports the claims in the manner required by
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. *In re**Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 1200, 26 USPQ2d 1600, 1603 (Fed. Cir.
 1993);  *Kawai**v.**Metlesics,* 480 F.2d 880, 178 USPQ 158 (CCPA 1973); *In
 re**Gosteli,* 872 F.2d 1008, 10 USPQ2d 1614 (Fed. Cir. 1989).
 

**IV.** **SUPPORT FOR A CLAIM CORRESPONDING TO A COUNT IN AN INTERFERENCE**In an interference proceeding, the claim corresponding to a count
 must be supported by the specification in the manner provided by **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. *Fields v. Conover,* 443 F.2d 1386, 170 USPQ 276 (CCPA
 1971) (A broad generic disclosure to a class of compounds was not a sufficient
 written description of a specific compound within the class.). Furthermore, when a
 party to an interference seeks the benefit of an earlier-filed U.S. patent
 application, the earlier application must meet the requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph for the subject matter of the count. *Hyatt v. Boone,* 146
 F.3d 1348, 1352, 47 USPQ2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1998).
 

**V.** **ORIGINAL CLAIM NOT SUFFICIENTLY
 DESCRIBED**While there is a presumption that an adequate written
 description of the claimed invention is present in the specification as filed,
 *In re Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 262, 191 USPQ 90, 96 (CCPA 1976),
 a question as to whether a specification provides an adequate written description may
 arise in the context of an original claim. An original claim may lack written
 description support when (1) the claim defines the invention in functional language
 specifying a desired result but the disclosure fails to sufficiently identify how the
 function is performed or the result is achieved or (2) a broad genus claim is
 presented but the disclosure only describes a narrow species with no evidence that
 the genus is contemplated. See *Ariad Pharms., Inc. v. Eli Lilly &
 Co.,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1349-50 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (en banc). The written
 description requirement is not necessarily met when the claim language appears
 *in ipsis verbis* in the specification. "Even if a claim is
 supported by the specification, the language of the specification, to the extent
 possible, must describe the claimed invention so that one skilled in the art can
 recognize what is claimed. The appearance of mere indistinct words in a specification
 or a claim, even an original claim, does not necessarily satisfy that
 requirement."*Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe, Inc.,* 323 F.3d
 956, 968, 63 USPQ2d 1609, 1616 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
 

**VI.** **INDEFINITENESS REJECTION OF A MEANS- (OR STEP-) PLUS-FUNCTION
 LIMITATION**A claim limitation expressed in means- (or step-)
 plus-function language "shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure,
 material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof."
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. If the specification fails to disclose sufficient corresponding structure,
 materials, or acts that perform the entire claimed function, then the claim
 limitation is indefinite because the applicant has in effect failed to particularly
 point out and distinctly claim the invention as required by **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d 1189, 1195, 29 USPQ2d
 1845, 1850 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc). Such a limitation also lacks an adequate
 written description as required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, because an indefinite, unbounded
 functional limitation would cover all ways of performing a function and indicate that
 the inventor has not provided sufficient disclosure to show possession of the
 invention. See also **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**.
 


, 
# 2163.04 Burden on the Examiner with Regard to the Written Description
 Requirement [R-11.2013]


The inquiry into whether the description requirement is met must be
 determined on a case-by-case basis and is a question of fact. *In re**Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 262, 191 USPQ 90, 96 (CCPA 1976). A
 description as filed is presumed to be adequate, unless or until sufficient evidence or
 reasoning to the contrary has been presented by the examiner to rebut the presumption.
 See, e.g., *In re Marzocchi,* 439 F.2d 220, 224, 169 USPQ 367, 370
 (CCPA 1971). The examiner, therefore, must have a reasonable basis to challenge the
 adequacy of the written description. The examiner has the initial burden of presenting
 by a preponderance of evidence why a person skilled in the art would not recognize in an
 applicant’s disclosure a description of the invention defined by the claims.
 *Wertheim,* 541 F.2d at 263, 191 USPQ at 97. 
 

**I.** **STATEMENT OF REJECTION REQUIREMENTS**In rejecting a claim, the examiner must set forth express findings
 of fact which support the lack of written description conclusion (see
 **[MPEP §
 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** for examination guidelines pertaining to the written
 description requirement). These findings should:
 


* (A) Identify the claim limitation(s) at issue; and
* (B) Establish a *prima facie* case by providing
 reasons why a person skilled in the art at the time the application was filed
 would not have recognized that the inventor was in possession of the invention
 as claimed in view of the disclosure of the application as filed. A general
 allegation of "unpredictability in the art" is not a sufficient reason to
 support a rejection for lack of adequate written description. A simple
 statement such as "Applicant has not pointed out where the new (or amended)
 claim is supported, nor does there appear to be a written description of the
 claim limitation ‘\_\_\_\_’ in the application as filed." may be sufficient where
 the claim is a new or amended claim, the support for the limitation is not
 apparent, and applicant has not pointed out where the limitation is
 supported.
 


See *Hyatt v. Dudas,* 492 F.3d 1365, 1370, 83
 USPQ2d 1373, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "**[[MPEP] §
 2163.04](s2163.html#d0e214731)** [subsection] (I)(B) as written is a lawful
 formulation of the *prima facie* standard for a lack of
 written description rejection.").


When appropriate, suggest amendments to the claims which can be
 supported by the application’s written description, being mindful of the prohibition
 against the addition of new matter in the claims or description. See
 *Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d at 1214, 211 USPQ at 326.
 

**II.** **RESPONSE TO APPLICANT’S REPLY**Upon reply by applicant, before repeating any rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 1,
 for lack of written description, review the basis for the rejection in view of the
 record as a whole, including amendments, arguments, and any evidence submitted by
 applicant. If the whole record now demonstrates that the written description
 requirement is satisfied, do not repeat the rejection in the next Office action. If
 the record still does not demonstrate that the written description is adequate to
 support the claim(s), repeat the rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 1,
 fully respond to applicant’s rebuttal arguments, and properly treat any further
 showings submitted by applicant in the reply. When a rejection is maintained, any
 affidavits relevant to the **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 1, written description requirement, must be
 thoroughly analyzed and discussed in the next Office action. See *In re
 Alton,* 76 F.3d 1168, 1176, 37 USPQ2d 1578, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

# 2163.05 Changes to the Scope of Claims [R-07.2015]


The failure to meet the written description requirement of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, commonly arises when the claims are changed after filing to either broaden or
 narrow the breadth of the claim limitations, or to alter a numerical range limitation or
 to use claim language which is not synonymous with the terminology used in the original
 disclosure. To comply with the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 1, or
 to be entitled to an earlier priority date or filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**,
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, or **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, each claim limitation must
 be expressly, implicitly, or inherently supported in the originally filed disclosure.
 See **[MPEP §
 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** for examination guidelines pertaining to the written
 description requirement.
 

**I.** **BROADENING CLAIM*** 

***A.******Omission of a Limitation***Under certain circumstances, omission of a limitation can raise
 an issue regarding whether the inventor had possession of a broader, more generic
 invention. See, e.g., *Gentry Gallery, Inc. v. Berkline Corp.,*
 134 F.3d 1473, 45 USPQ2d 1498 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (claims to a sectional sofa
 comprising, *inter alia,* a console and a control means were held
 invalid for failing to satisfy the written description requirement where the
 claims were broadened by removing the location of the control means.);
 *Johnson Worldwide Assoc. v. Zebco Corp.,* 175 F.3d 985, 993,
 50 USPQ2d 1607, 1613 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (In *Gentry Gallery,* the
 "court’s determination that the patent disclosure did not support a broad meaning
 for the disputed claim terms was premised on clear statements in the written
 description that described the location of a claim element--the ‘control
 means’--as ‘the only possible location’ and that variations were ‘outside the
 stated purpose of the invention.’ *Gentry Gallery,* 134 F.3d at
 1479, 45 USPQ2d at 1503. *Gentry Gallery,* then, considers the
 situation where the patent’s disclosure makes crystal clear that a particular
 (i.e., narrow) understanding of a claim term is an ‘essential element of [the
 inventor’s] invention.’"); **Tronzo v. Biomet*,* 156 F.3d at 1158-59, 47 USPQ2d
 at 1833 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (claims to generic cup shape were not entitled to filing
 date of parent application which disclosed "conical cup" in view of the disclosure
 of the parent application stating the advantages and importance of the conical
 shape.); *In re Wilder,* 736 F.2d 1516, 222 USPQ 369 (Fed. Cir.
 1984) (reissue claim omitting "in synchronism" limitation with respect to scanning
 means and indexing means was not supported by the original patent’s disclosure in
 such a way as to indicate possession, as of the original filing date, of that
 generic invention.). 
 


A claim that omits an element which applicant describes as an
 essential or critical feature of the invention originally disclosed does not
 comply with the written description requirement. See *Gentry
 Gallery,* 134 F.3d at 1480, 45 USPQ2d at 1503; *In re
 Sus,* 306 F.2d 494, 504, 134 USPQ 301, 309 (CCPA 1962) ("[O]ne skilled
 in this art would not be taught by the written description of the invention in the
 specification that any ‘aryl or substituted aryl radical’ would be suitable for
 the purposes of the invention but rather that only certain aryl radicals and
 certain specifically substituted aryl radicals [i.e., aryl azides] would be
 suitable for such purposes.") (emphasis in original). Compare *In re
 Peters,* 723 F.2d 891, 221 USPQ 952 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (In a reissue
 application, a claim to a display device was broadened by removing the limitations
 directed to the specific tapered shape of the tips without violating the written
 description requirement. The shape limitation was considered to be unnecessary
 since the specification, as filed, did not describe the tapered shape as essential
 or critical to the operation or patentability of the claim.). A claim which omits
 matter disclosed to be essential to the invention as described in the
 specification or in other statements of record may also be subject to rejection
 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para.
 1, as not enabling, or under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, para. 2. See *In re Mayhew,*
 527 F.2d 1229, 188 USPQ 356 (CCPA 1976); *In re Venezia,* 530
 F.2d 956, 189 USPQ 149 (CCPA 1976); and *In re Collier,* 397 F.2d
 1003, 158 USPQ 266 (CCPA 1968). See also **[MPEP § 2172.01](s2172.html#d0e217526)**.
 

***B.******Addition of Generic Claim***The written description requirement for a claimed genus may be
 satisfied through sufficient description of a representative number of species. A
 "representative number of species" means that the species which are adequately
 described are representative of the entire genus. Thus, when there is substantial
 variation within the genus, one must describe a sufficient variety of species to
 reflect the variation within the genus. See *AbbVie Deutschland GmbH &
 Co., KG v. Janssen Biotech, Inc.,* 759 F.3d 1285, 1300, 111 USPQ2d
 1780, 1790 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (Claims directed to a functionally defined genus of
 antibodies were not supported by a disclosure that "only describe[d] one type of
 structurally similar antibodies" that "are not representative of the full variety
 or scope of the genus."). The disclosure of only one species encompassed within a
 genus adequately describes a claim directed to that genus only if the disclosure
 "indicates that the patentee has invented species sufficient to constitute the
 gen[us]." See *Enzo Biochem,* 323 F.3d at 966, 63 USPQ2d at 1615.
 "A patentee will not be deemed to have invented species sufficient to constitute
 the genus by virtue of having disclosed a single species when … the evidence
 indicates ordinary artisans could not predict the operability in the invention of
 any species other than the one disclosed." *In re Curtis,* 354
 F.3d 1347, 1358, 69 USPQ2d 1274, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Claims directed to PTFE
 dental floss with a friction-enhancing coating were not supported by a disclosure
 of a microcrystalline wax coating where there was no evidence in the disclosure or
 anywhere else in the record showing applicant conveyed that any other coating was
 suitable for a PTFE dental floss.) On the other hand, there may be situations
 where one species adequately supports a genus. See, e.g., *In re
 Rasmussen,* 650 F.2d 1212, 1214, 211 USPQ 323, 326-27 (CCPA 1981)
 (disclosure of a single method of adheringly applying one layer to another was
 sufficient to support a generic claim to "adheringly applying" because one skilled
 in the art reading the specification would understand that it is unimportant how
 the layers are adhered, so long as they are adhered); *In re
 Herschler,* 591 F.2d 693, 697, 200 USPQ 711, 714 (CCPA 1979)
 (disclosure of corticosteriod in DMSO sufficient to support claims drawn to a
 method of using a mixture of a "physiologically active steroid" and DMSO because
 "use of known chemical compounds in a manner auxiliary to the invention must have
 a corresponding written description only so specific as to lead one having
 ordinary skill in the art to that class of compounds. Occasionally, a functional
 recitation of those known compounds in the specification may be sufficient as that
 description."); *In re Smythe,* 480 F.2d 1376, 1383, 178 USPQ
 279, 285 (CCPA 1973) (the phrase "air or other gas which is inert to the liquid"
 was sufficient to support a claim to "inert fluid media" because the description
 of the properties and functions of the air or other gas segmentizing medium would
 suggest to a person skilled in the art that appellant’s invention includes the use
 of "inert fluid" broadly.). However, in *Tronzo v. Biomet,* 156
 F.3d 1154, 1159, 47 USPQ2d 1829, 1833 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the disclosure of a
 species in the parent application did not suffice to provide written description
 support for the genus in the child application where the specification taught
 against other species. See also *In re Gosteli,* 872 F.2d 1008,
 10 USPQ2d 1614 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (generic and subgeneric claims in the U.S.
 application were not entitled to the benefit of foreign priority where the foreign
 application disclosed only two of the species encompassed by the broad generic
 claim and the subgeneric Markush claim that encompassed 21 compounds). 
 

**II.** **NARROWING OR SUBGENERIC CLAIM**The introduction of claim changes which involve narrowing the claims
 by introducing elements or limitations which are not supported by the as-filed
 disclosure is a violation of the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. See, e.g., *Fujikawa v. Wattanasin,* 93 F.3d 1559, 1571,
 39 USPQ2d 1895, 1905 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (a "laundry list" disclosure of every possible
 moiety does not constitute a written description of every species in a genus because
 it would not "reasonably lead" those skilled in the art to any particular species);
 *In re Ruschig,* 379 F.2d 990, 995, 154 USPQ 118, 123 (CCPA 1967)
 ("*If* n-propylamine had been used in making the compound instead
 of n-butylamine, the compound of claim 13 would have resulted. Appellants submit to
 us, as they did to the board, an imaginary specific example patterned on specific
 example 6 by which the above butyl compound is made so that we can see what a simple
 change would have resulted in a specific supporting disclosure being present in the
 present specification. The trouble is that there is no such disclosure, easy though
 it is to imagine it.") (emphasis in original); *Rozbicki v. Chiang,*
 590 Fed.App’x 990, 996 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (non-precedential) (The court found that
 patentee, "while attempting to obtain the broadest claim language possible during
 prosecution, cannot now improperly narrow its language by importing limitations not
 supported by the claim language or written description."). In *Ex
 parte**Ohshiro,* 14 USPQ2d 1750 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989), the
 Board affirmed the rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph,
 of claims to an internal combustion engine which recited "at least one of said piston
 and said cylinder (head) having a recessed channel." The Board held that the
 application which disclosed a cylinder head with a recessed channel and a piston
 without a recessed channel did not specifically disclose the "species" of a channeled
 piston.
 


While these and other cases find that recitation of an undisclosed
 species may violate the description requirement, a change involving subgeneric
 terminology may or may not be acceptable. Applicant was not entitled to the benefit
 of a parent filing date when the claim was directed to a subgenus (a specified range
 of molecular weight ratios) where the parent application contained a generic
 disclosure and a specific example that fell within the recited range because the
 court held that subgenus range was not described in the parent application.
 *In re**Lukach,* 442 F.2d 967, 169 USPQ 795 (CCPA 1971). On the other hand,
 in *Ex parte**Sorenson,* 3 USPQ2d 1462 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987), the
 subgeneric language of "aliphatic carboxylic acid" and "aryl carboxylic acid" did not
 violate the written description requirement because species falling within each
 subgenus were disclosed as well as the generic carboxylic acid. See also *In
 re**Smith,* 458 F.2d 1389, 1395, 173 USPQ 679, 683 (CCPA 1972)
 ("Whatever may be the viability of an inductive-deductive approach to arriving at a
 claimed subgenus, it cannot be said that such a subgenus is
 necessarily described by a genus encompassing it and a species upon which it reads."
 (emphasis added)). Each case must be decided on its own facts in terms of what is
 reasonably communicated to those skilled in the art. *In re**Wilder,* 736 F.2d 1516, 1520, 222 USPQ 369, 372 (Fed. Cir. 1984).
 
 

**III.** **RANGE LIMITATIONS**With respect to changing numerical range limitations, the analysis
 must take into account which ranges one skilled in the art would consider inherently
 supported by the discussion in the original disclosure. In the decision in
 *In re**Wertheim,* 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976), the ranges
 described in the original specification included a range of "25%- 60%" and specific
 examples of "36%" and "50%." A corresponding new claim limitation to "at least 35%"
 did not meet the description requirement because the phrase "at least" had no upper
 limit and caused the claim to read literally on embodiments outside the "25% to 60%"
 range, however a limitation to "between 35% and 60%" did meet the description
 requirement.
 


See also *Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Faulding Inc.,*
 230 F.3d 1320, 1328, 56 USPQ2d 1481, 1487 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("[T]he specification does
 not clearly disclose to the skilled artisan that the inventors... considered the...
 ratio to be part of their invention.... There is therefore no force to Purdue’s
 argument that the written description requirement was satisfied because the
 disclosure revealed a broad invention from which the [later-filed] claims carved out
 a patentable portion"). Compare *Union Oil of Cal. v. Atl. Richfield
 Co.,* 208 F.3d 989, 997, 54 USPQ2d 1227, 1232-33 (Fed. Cir. 2000)
 (Description in terms of ranges of chemical properties which work in combination with
 ranges of other chemical properties to produce an automotive gasoline that reduces
 emissions was found to provide an adequate written description even though the exact
 chemical components of each combination were not disclosed and the specification did
 not disclose any distinct embodiments corresponding to any claim at issue. "[T]he
 Patent Act and this court’s case law require only sufficient description to show one
 of skill in the . . . art that the inventor possessed the claimed invention at the
 time of filing.").

# 2163.06 Relationship of Written Description Requirement to New
 Matter [R-11.2013]


Lack of written description is an issue that generally arises with
 respect to the subject matter of a claim. If an applicant amends or attempts to amend
 the abstract, specification or drawings of an application, an issue of new matter will
 arise if the content of the amendment is not described in the application as filed.
 Stated another way, information contained in any one of the specification, claims or
 drawings of the application as filed may be added to any other part of the application
 without introducing new matter.
 


There are two statutory provisions that prohibit the introduction of
 new matter. The first provision is **[35 U.S.C. 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)**, which provides that
 no amendment shall introduce new matter into the disclosure of the invention. The second
 provision is **[35 U.S.C.
 251](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345)**, which provides that no new matter shall be introduced into
 the application for reissue.
 

**I.** **TREATMENT OF NEW MATTER**If new subject matter is added to the disclosure, whether it be in
 the abstract, the specification, or the drawings, the examiner should object to the
 introduction of new matter under **[35 U.S.C. 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)** or
 **[251](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345)** as appropriate, and require applicant to cancel the new
 matter. If new matter is added to the claims, the examiner should reject the claims
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph - written description requirement. *In re Rasmussen,* 650
 F.2d 1212, 211 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981). The examiner should still consider the subject
 matter added to the claim in making rejections based on prior art since the new
 matter rejection may be overcome by applicant.
 


When the claims have not been amended, *per se,*
 but the specification has been amended to add new matter, a rejection of the claims
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, should be made whenever any of the claim limitations are affected by the
 added material.
 


When an amendment is filed in reply to an objection or rejection
 based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, a study of the entire application is often necessary to determine whether
 or not "new matter" is involved. Applicant should therefore specifically point out
 the support for any amendments made to the disclosure.
 

**II.** **REVIEW OF NEW MATTER OBJECTIONS AND/OR REJECTIONS**A rejection of claims is reviewable by the Patent Trial and Appeal
 Board, whereas an objection and requirement to delete new matter is subject to
 supervisory review by petition under **[37 CFR 1.181](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324913)**. If both the claims
 and specification contain new matter either directly or indirectly, and there has
 been both a rejection and objection by the examiner, the issue becomes appealable and
 should not be decided by petition.
 

**III.** **CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER NOT DISCLOSED IN REMAINDER OF SPECIFICATION**The claims as filed in the original specification are part of the
 disclosure and therefore, if an application as originally filed contains a claim
 disclosing material not disclosed in the remainder of the specification, the
 applicant may amend the specification to include the claimed subject matter.
 *In re**Benno,* 768 F.2d 1340, 226 USPQ 683 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Form
 paragraph **[7.44](#fp7.44)** may be used where originally claimed subject
 matter lacks proper antecedent basis in the specification. See **[MPEP §
 608.01(o)](s608.html#d0e46173)**.
 


, 
# 2163.07 Amendments to Application Which Are Supported in the Original
 Description [R-08.2017]


Amendments to an application which are supported in the original
 description are NOT new matter.
 

**I.** **REPHRASING**Mere rephrasing of a passage does not constitute new matter.
 Accordingly, a rewording of a passage where the same meaning remains intact is
 permissible. *In re Anderson,* 471 F.2d 1237, 176 USPQ 331 (CCPA
 1973). The mere inclusion of dictionary or art recognized definitions known at the
 time of filing an application may not be considered new matter. If there are multiple
 definitions for a term and a definition is added to the application, it must be clear
 from the application as filed that applicant intended a particular definition, in
 order to avoid an issue of new matter and/or lack of written description. See, e.g.,
 *Schering Corp. v. Amgen, Inc.,* 222 F.3d 1347, 1352-53, 55
 USPQ2d 1650, 1654 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In *Schering,* the original
 disclosure was drawn to recombinant DNA molecules and used the term "leukocyte
 interferon." Shortly after the filing date, a scientific committee abolished the term
 in favor of "IFN-(a)," since the latter term more specifically identified a
 particular polypeptide and since the committee found that leukocytes also produced
 other types of interferon. The court held that the subsequent amendment to the
 specification and claims substituting the term "IFN-(a)" for "leukocyte interferon"
 merely renamed the invention and did not constitute new matter. The claims were
 limited to cover only the interferon subtype coded for by the inventor’s original
 deposits.
 

**II.** **OBVIOUS ERRORS**An amendment to correct an obvious error does not constitute new
 matter where one skilled in the art would not only recognize the existence of error
 in the specification, but also the appropriate correction. *In re**Oda,* 443 F.2d 1200, 170 USPQ 268 (CCPA 1971).
 


Where a foreign priority document under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**
 is of record in the U.S. application file, applicant may not rely on the disclosure
 of that document to support correction of an error in the pending U.S. application.
 *Ex parte**Bondiou,* 132 USPQ 356 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1961). This
 prohibition applies regardless of the language of the foreign priority documents
 because a claim for priority is simply a claim for the benefit of an earlier filing
 date for subject matter that is common to two or more applications, and does not
 serve to incorporate the content of the priority document in the application in which
 the claim for priority is made. This prohibition does not apply where the U.S.
 application explicitly incorporates the foreign priority document by reference. For
 applications filed on or after September 21, 2004, where all or a portion of the
 specification or drawing(s) is inadvertently omitted from the U.S. application, a
 claim under **[37
 CFR 1.55](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#plt_d0e319217)** for priority of a prior-filed foreign application that
 is present on the filing date of the application is considered an incorporation by
 reference of the prior-filed foreign application as to the inadvertently omitted
 portion of the specification or drawing(s), subject to the conditions and
 requirements of **[37
 CFR 1.57(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319490)**. See **[37 CFR 1.57(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319490)** and
 **[MPEP §
 217](s217.html#ch200_d1ff72_27f9d_2c9)**.
 


Where a U.S. application as originally filed was in a non-English
 language and an English translation thereof was subsequently submitted pursuant to
 **[37 CFR
 1.52(d)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e318327)**, if there is an error in the English translation,
 applicant may rely on the disclosure of the originally filed non-English language
 U.S. application to support correction of an error in the English translation
 document.
 



# 2163.07(a) Inherent Function, Theory, or Advantage [R-08.2017]


By disclosing in a patent application a device that inherently
 performs a function or has a property, operates according to a theory or has an
 advantage, a patent application necessarily discloses that function, theory or
 advantage, even though it says nothing explicit concerning it. The application may
 later be amended to recite the function, theory or advantage without introducing
 prohibited new matter. *In re**Reynolds,* 443 F.2d 384, 170 USPQ 94 (CCPA 1971); *In
 re**Smythe,* 480 F. 2d 1376, 178 USPQ 279 (CCPA 1973); *Yeda
 Research and Dev. Co. v. Abbott GMBH & Co.,* 837 F.3d 1341, 120
 USPQ2d 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("Under the doctrine of inherent disclosure, when a
 specification describes an invention that has certain undisclosed yet inherent
 properties, that specification serves as adequate written description to support a
 subsequent patent application that explicitly recites the invention’s inherent
 properties." (citing *Kennecott Corp. v. Kyocera Int’l, Inc.,* 835
 F.2d 1419, 1423 (Fed. Cir. 1987))). "To establish inherency, the extrinsic evidence
 ‘must make clear that the missing descriptive matter is necessarily present in the
 thing described in the reference, and that it would be so recognized by persons of
 ordinary skill. Inherency, however, may not be established by probabilities or
 possibilities. The mere fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of
 circumstances is not sufficient.’" *In re Robertson,* 169 F.3d 743,
 745, 49 USPQ2d 1949, 1950-51 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted).
 




# 2163.07(b) Incorporation by Reference [R-11.2013]


Instead of repeating some information contained in another document,
 an application may attempt to incorporate the content of another document or part
 thereof by reference to the document in the text of the specification. The
 information incorporated is as much a part of the application as filed as if the text
 was repeated in the application, and should be treated as part of the text of the
 application as filed. Replacing the identified material incorporated by reference
 with the actual text is not new matter. See **[37 CFR 1.57](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319490)** and
