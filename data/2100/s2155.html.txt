# 2155 Use of Affidavits or Declarations Under 37 CFR 1.130
 To Overcome Prior Art Rejections [R-07.2015]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as
 set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is subject to
 examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP § 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for

#### *37 CFR 1.130 Affidavit or declaration of attribution or prior public disclosure under the
 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.*


* (a) *Affidavit or declaration of attribution*. When any claim of an
 application or a patent under reexamination is rejected, the applicant or patent
 owner may submit an appropriate affidavit or declaration to disqualify a
 disclosure as prior art by establishing that the disclosure was made by the
 inventor or a joint inventor, or the subject matter disclosed was obtained
 directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.
* (b) *Affidavit or declaration of prior public disclosure*. When any
 claim of an application or a patent under reexamination is rejected, the applicant
 or patent owner may submit an appropriate affidavit or declaration to disqualify a
 disclosure as prior art by establishing that the subject matter disclosed had,
 before such disclosure was made or before such subject matter was effectively
 filed, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who
 obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or
 a joint inventor. An affidavit or declaration under this paragraph must identify
 the subject matter publicly disclosed and provide the date such subject matter was
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who obtained the
 subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint
 inventor.
	+ (1) If the subject matter publicly disclosed on
	 that date was in a printed publication, the affidavit or declaration must be
	 accompanied by a copy of the printed publication.
	+ (2) If the subject matter publicly disclosed on
	 that date was not in a printed publication, the affidavit or declaration
	 must describe the subject matter with sufficient detail and particularity to
	 determine what subject matter had been publicly disclosed on that date by
	 the inventor or a joint inventor or another who obtained the subject matter
	 disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.
* (c) *When this section is not available*. The provisions of this
 section are not available if the rejection is based upon a disclosure made more
 than one year before the effective filing date of the claimed invention. The
 provisions of this section may not be available if the rejection is based upon a
 U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication of a patented or pending
 application naming another inventor, the patent or pending application claims an
 invention that is the same or substantially the same as the applicant's or patent
 owner's claimed invention, and the affidavit or declaration contends that an
 inventor named in the U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication derived
 the claimed invention from the inventor or a joint inventor named in the
 application or patent, in which case an applicant or a patent owner may file a
 petition for a derivation proceeding pursuant to **[§
 42.401](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fd69_16c42_18a)***et seq.* of this title.
* (d) *Applications and patents to which this section is applicable*.
 The provisions of this section apply to any application for patent, and to any
 patent issuing thereon, that contains, or contained at any time:
	+ (1) A claim to a claimed invention that has an
	 effective filing date as defined in **[§ 1.109](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322413)** that is on or
	 after March 16, 2013; or
	+ (2) A specific reference under **[35 U.S.C.
	 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)** to any patent or
	 application that contains, or contained at any time, a claim to a claimed
	 invention that has an effective filing date as defined in **[§
	 1.109](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322413)** that is on or after March 16, 2013.



The Office has provided a mechanism in **[37 CFR 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)** for
 filing an affidavit or declaration to establish that a disclosure is not prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)** due to an exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)**. Under **[37 CFR 1.130(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323473)**, an affidavit or
 declaration of attribution may be submitted to disqualify a disclosure as prior art because
 it was made by the inventor or a joint inventor, or the subject matter disclosed was
 obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor. Under
 **[37 CFR
 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)**, an affidavit or declaration of prior public disclosure may
 be submitted to disqualify an intervening disclosure as prior art if the subject matter
 disclosed had, before such disclosure was made or before such subject matter was
 effectively filed in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO published
 application, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who
 obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint
 inventor.
 



# 2155.01 Showing That the Disclosure Was Made by the
 Inventor or a Joint Inventor [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA
 as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_17f)** provides that a grace period disclosure shall
 not be prior art to a claimed invention under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if the disclosure was made by the inventor or a joint
 inventor. An applicant may show that a disclosure was made by the inventor or a joint
 inventor by way of an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323473)** (an affidavit or
 declaration of attribution). See *In re Katz,* 687 F.2d 450, 455, 215
 USPQ 14, 18 (CCPA 1982) and **[MPEP § 718](s718.html#d0e93900)**. Where the authorship of the
 prior art disclosure includes the inventor or a joint inventor named in the application,
 an "unequivocal" statement from the inventor or a joint inventor that the inventor or
 joint inventor (or some specific combination of named inventors) invented the subject
 matter of the disclosure, accompanied by a reasonable explanation of the presence of
 additional authors, may be acceptable in the absence of evidence to the contrary. See
 *In re DeBaun,* 687 F.2d 459, 463, 214 USPQ 933, 936 (CCPA 1982).
 However, an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** that is only a naked
 assertion of inventorship and that fails to provide any context, explanation or evidence
 to support that assertion is insufficient to show that the relied-upon subject matter
 was the inventor’s own work. See *EmeraChem Holdings, LLC v. Volkswagen Grp. of
 Am., Inc.,* 859 F.3d 1341, 123 USPQ2d 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (finding that a
 declaration submitted by inventor Campbell insufficient to establish that he and Guth
 (now deceased) were inventors of the subject matter disclosed in a patent naming
 Campbell, Guth, Danziger, and Padron because "[n]othing in the declaration itself, or in
 addition to the declaration, provides any context, explanation, or evidence to lend
 credence to the inventor's bare assertion" and more than twenty years had passed since
 the alleged events occurred. *Id.* at 1345; 123 USPQ2d at 1149.). See
 also *Ex parte Kroger,* 219 USPQ 370 (Bd. App. 1982) (affirming
 rejection notwithstanding declarations by the alleged actual inventors as to their
 inventorship in view of a nonapplicant author submitting a letter declaring the
 nonapplicant author's inventorship). This is similar to the current process for
 disqualifying a publication as not being by "others" discussed in **[MPEP § 2132.01](s2132.html#d0e203530)**,
 except that **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_17f)** requires only that the disclosure be
 by the inventor or a joint inventor.
 




# 2155.02 Showing That the Subject Matter Disclosed Had
 Been Previously Publicly Disclosed by the Inventor or a Joint Inventor [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA
 as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)** provides that a grace period disclosure shall
 not be prior art to a claimed invention under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if subject matter disclosed had, before such disclosure,
 been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor. Similarly,
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** provides that a disclosure shall not be prior
 art to a claimed invention under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the
 subject matter disclosed had, before such subject matter was effectively filed under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a
 joint inventor. An applicant may show that the subject matter disclosed had been
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor before the disclosure or
 effective filing date of the subject matter on which the rejection was based by way of
 an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** (an affidavit or
 declaration of prior public disclosure). Specifically, the affidavit or declaration must
 identify the subject matter publicly disclosed and establish the date and content of
 their earlier public disclosure. If the earlier public disclosure is a printed
 publication, the affidavit or declaration must be accompanied by a copy of the printed
 publication in accordance with**[37 CFR 1.130(b)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_280b3_345)**. If the earlier
 disclosure is not a printed publication, the affidavit or declaration must describe the
 earlier disclosure with sufficient detail and particularity to determine that the
 earlier disclosure is a public disclosure of the subject matter, as required by
 **[37 CFR
 1.130(b)(2)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_28122_1d7)**.
 


The manner of disclosure of subject matter referenced in
 an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)(2)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_28122_1d7)** is not critical.
 Just as the prior art provision of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** encompasses
 any disclosure that renders a claimed invention "available to the public," any manner of
 disclosure may be evidenced in an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)**.
 That is, when using an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** to
 disqualify an intervening disclosure as prior art based on a prior public disclosure by
 an inventor or a joint inventor, it is not necessary for the subject matter to have been
 disclosed in the same manner or using the same words. For example, the inventor or a
 joint inventor may have publicly disclosed the subject matter in question via a slide
 presentation at a scientific meeting, while the intervening disclosure of the subject
 matter may have been made in a journal article. This difference in the manner of
 disclosure or differences in the words used to describe the subject matter will not
 preclude the inventor from submitting an affidavit or declaration under
 **[37 CFR
 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** to disqualify the intervening disclosure (e.g., a journal
 article) as prior art.

 treatment for disclosures of subject matter by another who obtained the subject matter
 disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor. Specifically,
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_17f)** provides that a grace period disclosure shall
 not be prior art to a claimed invention under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if the disclosure was made by another who obtained the
 subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor,
 and **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1a7)** provides that a disclosure shall not be prior
 art to a claimed invention under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the
 subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a
 joint inventor.
 


In addition, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)** and **[102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** respectively provide
 that a grace period disclosure under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, and that a
 disclosure under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** shall not be
 prior art to a claimed invention, if the subject matter disclosed had, before such grace
 disclosure was made or before such subject matter was effectively filed according to
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, been publicly disclosed by another who obtained the
 subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.
 An applicant may also show that another obtained the subject matter disclosed directly
 or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor in an affidavit or declaration under
 **[37 CFR
 1.130(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323473)** or **[(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)**. Thus, an applicant may
 establish a prior public disclosure by another during the grace period if the applicant
 can establish that subject matter disclosed originated with the inventor or a joint
 inventor and that the subject matter was communicated by the inventor or a joint
 inventor, directly or indirectly. Any documentation which provides evidence of the
 communication of the subject matter by the inventor or a joint inventor to the entity
 that made the disclosure of the subject matter directly or indirectly, such as by an
 assignee of the inventor, should accompany the affidavit or declaration.

In accordance with **[37 CFR 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)**, the applicant or
 patent owner may submit an affidavit or declaration. When an assignee, obligated
 assignee, or person showing sufficient proprietary interest is the applicant under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 118](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302910912)** rather than the inventor, the inventor may sign an affidavit
 or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)** to disqualify a disclosure of the invention as prior
 art, but the declaration must be filed by a party having authority to take action in the
 application. Authority to file papers in an application generally does not lie with the
 inventor if the inventor is not the applicant.

# 2155.01 Showing That the Disclosure Was Made by the
 Inventor or a Joint Inventor [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA
 as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_17f)** provides that a grace period disclosure shall
 not be prior art to a claimed invention under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if the disclosure was made by the inventor or a joint
 inventor. An applicant may show that a disclosure was made by the inventor or a joint
 inventor by way of an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323473)** (an affidavit or
 declaration of attribution). See *In re Katz,* 687 F.2d 450, 455, 215
 USPQ 14, 18 (CCPA 1982) and **[MPEP § 718](s718.html#d0e93900)**. Where the authorship of the
 prior art disclosure includes the inventor or a joint inventor named in the application,
 an "unequivocal" statement from the inventor or a joint inventor that the inventor or
 joint inventor (or some specific combination of named inventors) invented the subject
 matter of the disclosure, accompanied by a reasonable explanation of the presence of
 additional authors, may be acceptable in the absence of evidence to the contrary. See
 *In re DeBaun,* 687 F.2d 459, 463, 214 USPQ 933, 936 (CCPA 1982).
 However, an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** that is only a naked
 assertion of inventorship and that fails to provide any context, explanation or evidence
 to support that assertion is insufficient to show that the relied-upon subject matter
 was the inventor’s own work. See *EmeraChem Holdings, LLC v. Volkswagen Grp. of
 Am., Inc.,* 859 F.3d 1341, 123 USPQ2d 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (finding that a
 declaration submitted by inventor Campbell insufficient to establish that he and Guth
 (now deceased) were inventors of the subject matter disclosed in a patent naming
 Campbell, Guth, Danziger, and Padron because "[n]othing in the declaration itself, or in
 addition to the declaration, provides any context, explanation, or evidence to lend
 credence to the inventor's bare assertion" and more than twenty years had passed since
 the alleged events occurred. *Id.* at 1345; 123 USPQ2d at 1149.). See
 also *Ex parte Kroger,* 219 USPQ 370 (Bd. App. 1982) (affirming
 rejection notwithstanding declarations by the alleged actual inventors as to their
 inventorship in view of a nonapplicant author submitting a letter declaring the
 nonapplicant author's inventorship). This is similar to the current process for
 disqualifying a publication as not being by "others" discussed in **[MPEP § 2132.01](s2132.html#d0e203530)**,
 except that **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_17f)** requires only that the disclosure be
 by the inventor or a joint inventor.

# 2155.02 Showing That the Subject Matter Disclosed Had
 Been Previously Publicly Disclosed by the Inventor or a Joint Inventor [R-11.2013]

 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA
 as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See

 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)** provides that a grace period disclosure shall
 not be prior art to a claimed invention under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if subject matter disclosed had, before such disclosure,
 been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor. Similarly,
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** provides that a disclosure shall not be prior
 art to a claimed invention under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the
 subject matter disclosed had, before such subject matter was effectively filed under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a
 joint inventor. An applicant may show that the subject matter disclosed had been
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor before the disclosure or
 effective filing date of the subject matter on which the rejection was based by way of
 an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** (an affidavit or
 declaration of prior public disclosure). Specifically, the affidavit or declaration must
 identify the subject matter publicly disclosed and establish the date and content of
 their earlier public disclosure. If the earlier public disclosure is a printed
 publication, the affidavit or declaration must be accompanied by a copy of the printed
 publication in accordance with**[37 CFR 1.130(b)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_280b3_345)**. If the earlier
 disclosure is not a printed publication, the affidavit or declaration must describe the
 earlier disclosure with sufficient detail and particularity to determine that the
 earlier disclosure is a public disclosure of the subject matter, as required by
 **[37 CFR
 1.130(b)(2)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_28122_1d7)**.
 


The manner of disclosure of subject matter referenced in
 an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)(2)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_28122_1d7)** is not critical.
 Just as the prior art provision of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** encompasses
 any disclosure that renders a claimed invention "available to the public," any manner of
 disclosure may be evidenced in an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)**.
 That is, when using an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** to
 disqualify an intervening disclosure as prior art based on a prior public disclosure by
 an inventor or a joint inventor, it is not necessary for the subject matter to have been
 disclosed in the same manner or using the same words. For example, the inventor or a
 joint inventor may have publicly disclosed the subject matter in question via a slide
 presentation at a scientific meeting, while the intervening disclosure of the subject
 matter may have been made in a journal article. This difference in the manner of
 disclosure or differences in the words used to describe the subject matter will not
 preclude the inventor from submitting an affidavit or declaration under
 **[37 CFR
 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** to disqualify the intervening disclosure (e.g., a journal
 article) as prior art.

 and **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1a7)** provides that a disclosure shall not be prior

 subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a
 joint inventor.
 


In addition, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)** and **[102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** respectively provide
 that a grace period disclosure under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, and that a
 disclosure under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** shall not be
 prior art to a claimed invention, if the subject matter disclosed had, before such grace
 disclosure was made or before such subject matter was effectively filed according to
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, been publicly disclosed by another who obtained the
 subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.
 An applicant may also show that another obtained the subject matter disclosed directly
 or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor in an affidavit or declaration under
 **[37 CFR

 establish a prior public disclosure by another during the grace period if the applicant
 can establish that subject matter disclosed originated with the inventor or a joint
 inventor and that the subject matter was communicated by the inventor or a joint
 inventor, directly or indirectly. Any documentation which provides evidence of the
 communication of the subject matter by the inventor or a joint inventor to the entity
 that made the disclosure of the subject matter directly or indirectly, such as by an
 assignee of the inventor, should accompany the affidavit or declaration.
