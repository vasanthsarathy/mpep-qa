**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)** provides three conditions that must be satisfied in order for
 subject matter disclosed which might otherwise qualify as prior art, and a claimed
 invention, to be treated as having been owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person in applying common ownership provisions of
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** in the context of a joint research agreement.
 First, the subject matter disclosed must have been developed and the claimed invention must
 have been made by, or on behalf of, one or more parties to a joint research agreement that
 was in effect on or before the effective filing date of the claimed invention. See
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102(c)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_161)**. The AIA defines the term "joint research agreement" as a
 written contract, grant, or cooperative agreement entered into by two or more persons or
 entities for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work in the field
 of the claimed invention. See **[35 U.S.C. 100(h)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e10_359)**. Second, the claimed
 invention must have been made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of the
 joint research agreement. See **[35 U.S.C. 102(c)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_175)**. Third, the
 application for patent for the claimed invention must disclose, or be amended to disclose,
 the names of the parties to the joint research agreement. See **[35 U.S.C.
 102(c)(3)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_183)**. Joint research agreement subject matter under
 **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** is treated under **[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(5)(ii)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322235)**, joint research agreement subject matter under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** is treated under **[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(5)(ii)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322235)**. If these conditions are met, the joint research
 agreement prior art is not available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 


The provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)** generally track those of the Cooperative Research and
 Technology Enhancement Act of 2004 (CREATE Act). See **[MPEP §
 2146.01](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_126fa_f3)**. The major differences between **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)** and the CREATE Act are that: (1) the AIA provision is keyed to
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention, while the CREATE Act focuses on the
 date that the claimed invention was made; and (2) the CREATE Act provisions only apply to
 obviousness rejections and not to anticipation rejections.
 


In order to invoke a joint research agreement to except a
 disclosure as prior art, the applicant (or the applicant's representative of record) must
 provide a statement that the disclosure of the subject matter on which the rejection is
 based and the claimed invention were made by or on behalf of parties to a joint research
 agreement under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)**. The statement must also assert that the
 agreement was in effect on or before the effective filing date of the claimed invention,
 and that the claimed invention was made as a result of activities undertaken within the
 scope of the joint research agreement. When relying on the provisions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**, the applicant or his attorney or agent of record can provide
 a similar statement to disqualify the cited prior art as to the issue of obviousness. If
 the names of the parties to the joint research agreement are not already stated in the
 application, it is necessary to amend the application to include the names of the parties
 to the joint research agreement in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.71(g)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320173)**.
 


As is the case with establishing common ownership, the
 applicant may, but is not required to, present evidence supporting the existence of the
 joint research agreement. Furthermore, the Office will not request corroborating evidence
 in the absence of independent evidence which raises doubt as to the existence of the joint
 research agreement.
 


As discussed previously, the **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception does not apply to a disclosure that qualifies
 as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** (disclosures
 made before the effective filing date of the claimed invention). Thus, if the issue date or
 publication date of a U.S. patent document is before the effective filing date of the
 claimed invention, it may be prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, regardless of
 the fact that the claimed invention resulted from a joint research agreement and the
 disclosure was by a party to the agreement.
