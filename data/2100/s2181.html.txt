# 2181 Identifying and Interpreting a 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or Pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph Limitation [R-10.2019]


This section sets forth guidelines for the examination of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 "means or step plus function" limitations in a claim. Throughout this section, reference is
 made to **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**, however the guidance is equally applicable to
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph.
 


The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in its *en
 banc* decision *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d 1189, 1194, 29
 USPQ2d 1845, 1850 (Fed. Cir. 1994), stated:
 



> 
> Per our holding, the "broadest reasonable interpretation" that an
>  examiner may give means-plus-function language is that statutorily mandated in paragraph
>  six. Accordingly, the PTO may not disregard the structure disclosed in the specification
>  corresponding to such language when rendering a patentability determination. 
>  
> 
> 
> 


In *Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC,* 792
 F.3d 1339, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2015) the court stated:
 



> 
> [t]he standard is whether the words of the claim are
>  understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art to have a sufficiently definite
>  meaning as the name for structure. 
>  
>

> 


Therefore, the broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim
 limitation that invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** is the structure,
 material or act described in the specification as performing the entire claimed function
 and equivalents to the disclosed structure, material or act. As a result, **[section
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** limitations will, in some cases, be afforded a more narrow
 interpretation than a limitation that is not crafted in "means plus function" format.
 

**I.** **DETERMINING WHETHER A CLAIM LIMITATION INVOKES 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or PRE-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112, SIXTH PARAGRAPH**The USPTO must apply **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** in appropriate
 cases, and give claims their broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI), in light of and
 consistent with the written description of the invention in the application. In
 determining the BRI, examiners should establish the meaning of each claim term
 consistent with the specification as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in
 the art, including identifying and construing functional claim limitations. If a claim
 limitation recites a term and associated functional language, the examiner should
 determine whether the claim limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**. Application of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** is driven by the claim language, not by applicant’s intent
 or mere statements to the contrary included in the specification or made during
 prosecution. See *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d at 1194, 29 USPQ2d at
 1850 (stating that **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph "merely sets a limit on how
 broadly the PTO may construe means-plus-function language under the rubric of reasonable
 interpretation’"). The Federal Circuit has held that applicants (and reexamination
 patentees) before the USPTO have the opportunity and the obligation to define their
 inventions precisely during proceedings before the USPTO. See *In re
 Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048, 1056–57, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1029–30 (Fed. Cir. 1997)
 (**[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph places the burden of precise claim drafting
 on the applicant); *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 322, 13 USPQ2d 1320,
 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (manner of claim interpretation that is used by courts in
 litigation is not the manner of claim interpretation that is applicable during
 prosecution of a pending application before the USPTO); *Sage Prods., Inc. v.
 Devon Indus., Inc.,* 126 F.3d 1420, 1425, 44 USPQ2d 1103, 1107 (Fed. Cir.
 1997) (patentee who had a clear opportunity to negotiate broader claims during
 prosecution but did not do so, may not seek to expand the claims through the doctrine of
 equivalents, for it is the patentee, not the public, who must bear the cost of failure
 to seek protection for this foreseeable alteration of its claimed structure). 
 


 A claim limitation is presumed to invoke
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** when it explicitly uses the term "means" or "step" and
 includes functional language. The presumption that **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applies is overcome when the limitation further includes
 the structure, material or acts necessary to perform the recited function. See
 *TriMed, Inc. v. Stryker Corp.,* 514 F.3d 1256, 1259-60, 85 USPQ2d
 1787, 1789 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("Sufficient structure exists when the claim language
 specifies the exact structure that performs the function in question without need to
 resort to other portions of the specification or extrinsic evidence for an adequate
 understanding of the structure."); see also *Altiris, Inc. v. Symantec
 Corp.,* 318 F.3d 1363, 1376, 65 USPQ2d 1865, 1874 (Fed. Cir. 2003).
 


 By contrast, a claim limitation that does not use the
 term "means" or "step" will trigger the rebuttable presumption that **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** does not apply. See, e.g., *Phillips v. AWH
 Corp.,* 415 F.3d 1303, 1310, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2005)
 *(en banc)*; *CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick
 Corp.,* 288 F.3d 1359, 1369, 62 USPQ2d 1658, 1664 (Fed. Cir. 2002);
 *Personalized Media Commc’ns, LLC v. ITC,* 161 F.3d 696, 703-04, 48
 USPQ2d 1880, 1886–87 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Even in the face of this presumption, the
 examiner should nonetheless consider whether the presumption is overcome. The
 presumption that **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** does not apply to a
 claim limitation that does not use the term "means" is overcome when "the claim term
 fails to 'recite sufficiently definite structure' or else recites 'function without
 reciting sufficient structure for performing that function.'"
 *Williamson,* 792 F.3d at 1349, 115 USPQ2d at 1111 (Fed. Cir. 2015)
 (*en banc*) (quoting *Watts v. XL Systems, Inc.,*
 232 F.3d 877, 880 (Fed. Cir. 2000); see also *Personalized Media Communications,
 LLC v. International Trade Commission,* 161 F. 3d 696, 704 (Fed. Cir.
 1998).
 


 Instead of using "means" in such cases, a substitute
 term acts as a generic placeholder for the term "means" and would not be recognized by
 one of ordinary skill in the art as being sufficiently definite structure for performing
 the claimed function. "The standard is whether the words of the claim are understood by
 persons of ordinary skill in the art to have a sufficiently definite meaning as the name
 for structure." *Williamson,* 792 F.3d at 1349, 115 USPQ2d at 1111; see
 also *Greenberg v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.,* 91 F.3d 1580, 1583, 39
 USPQ2d 1783, 1786 (Fed. Cir. 1996). 
 


 Accordingly, examiners will apply **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** to a claim limitation if it meets the following 3-prong
 analysis:
 


* (A) the claim limitation uses the term "means" or "step" or a term
 used as a substitute for "means" that is a generic placeholder (also called a
 nonce term or a non-structural term having no specific structural meaning) for
 performing the claimed function;
* (B) the term "means" or "step" or the generic placeholder is modified
 by functional language, typically, but not always linked by the transition word
 "for" (e.g., "means for") or another linking word or phrase, such as "configured
 to" or "so that"; and
* (C) the term "means" or "step" or the generic placeholder is not
 modified by sufficient structure, material, or acts for performing the claimed
 function.


A determination that a claim is being interpreted
 according to **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** should be expressly stated in the examiner’s
 Office action. If a claim limitation uses the term "means" or "step," but the examiner
 determines that either the second prong or the third prong of the 3-prong analysis is
 not met, then in these situations, the examiner must include a statement in the Office
 action explaining the reasons why a claim limitation which uses the term "means" or
 "step" is not being treated under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**.
 


 In response to the Office action that finds that
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** is invoked, if applicant does not want to have the claim
 limitation interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**, applicant may: (1)
 present a sufficient showing to establish that the claim limitation recites sufficient
 structure to perform the claimed function so as to avoid interpretation under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**; or (2) amend the claim limitation in a way that avoids
 interpretation under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** (e.g., by reciting
 sufficient structure to perform the claimed function).
 


In the event that it is unclear whether the claim
 limitation falls within the scope of **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**, a rejection under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** may be appropriate.
 

***A.******The Claim Limitation Uses the Term "Means" or "Step" or a Generic
 Placeholder (A Term That Is Simply A Substitute for "Means")***  With respect to the first prong of this analysis, a claim element
 that does not include the term "means" or "step" triggers a rebuttable presumption
 that **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** does not apply. When the claim limitation does
 not use the term "means," examiners should determine whether the presumption that
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** does not apply is overcome. The presumption may
 be overcome if the claim limitation uses a generic placeholder (a term that is simply
 a substitute for the term "means"). The following is a list of non-structural generic
 placeholders that may invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**:
 **"mechanism for," "module for," "device for," "unit for," "component for,"
 "element for," "member for," "apparatus for," "machine for," or "system
 for."***Welker Bearing Co., v. PHD, Inc.,* 550 F.3d 1090, 1096, 89 USPQ2d
 1289, 1293-94 (Fed. Cir. 2008); *Mass. Inst. of Tech. v. Abacus
 Software,* 462 F.3d 1344, 1354, 80 USPQ2d 1225, 1228 (Fed. Cir. 2006);
 *Personalized Media,* 161 F.3d at 704, 48 USPQ2d at 1886–87;
 *Mas-Hamilton Group v. LaGard, Inc.,* 156 F.3d 1206, 1214-1215,
 48 USPQ2d 1010, 1017 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Note that there is no fixed list of generic
 placeholders that always result in **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** interpretation,
 and likewise there is no fixed list of words that always avoid **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** interpretation. Every case will turn on its own unique
 set of facts.
 


The standard is whether the words of the claim are
 understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art to have a sufficiently definite
 meaning as the name for structure." *Williamson v. Citrix Online,*
 LLC, 792 F.3d 1339, 1349, 115 USPQ2d 1105, 1111 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The issue in
 *Williamson* was whether a "distributed learning control module"
 limitation in claims directed to a distributed learning system should be interpreted
 as a means-plus-function limitation. See *Williamson,* 792 F.3d at
 1347. The Federal Circuit concluded that ‘‘the ‘distributed learning control module’
 limitation fails to recite sufficiently definite structure and that the presumption
 against means-plus function claiming is rebutted." *Id.* at 1351. In
 support, the Federal Circuit determined that "the word ‘module’ does not provide any
 indication of structure because it sets forth the same black box recitation of
 structure for providing the same specified function as if the term ‘means’ had been
 used." *Id.* at 1350–51.
 


If persons of ordinary skill in the art reading the
 specification understand the term to have a sufficiently definite meaning as the name
 for the structure that performs the function, even when the term covers a broad class
 of structures or identifies the structures by their function (e.g., "filters,"
 "brakes," "clamp," "screwdriver," and "locks") **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** will not apply. *Apex Inc. v. Raritan Computer,
 Inc.,* 325 F.3d 1364, 1372-73, 66 USPQ2d 1444, 1451-52 (Fed. Cir. 2003);

 USPQ2d at 1888; *Greenberg v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.,* 91 F.3d
 1580, 1583, 39 USPQ2d 1783, 1786 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("Many devices take their names
 from the functions they perform.") The term is not required to denote a specific
 structure or a precise physical structure to avoid the application of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**. See *Watts,* 232 F.3d at 880,
 56 USPQ2d at 1838; *Inventio AG v. Thyssenkrupp Elevator Americas
 Corp.,* 649 F.3d 1350, 99 USPQ2d 1112 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that the
 claim terms "modernizing device" and "computing unit" when read in light of the
 specification connoted sufficient, definite structure to one of skill in the art to
 preclude application of **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph).
 The following are examples of structural terms that have been found **not**
 to invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, paragraph
 6: "circuit," "detent mechanism," "digital detector," "reciprocating member,"
 "connector assembly," "perforation," "sealingly connected joints," and "eyeglass
 hanger member." See *Mass. Inst. of Tech.,* 462 F.3d at 1355-1356,
 80 USPQ2d at 1332 (the court found the recitation of "aesthetic correction circuitry"
 sufficient to avoid **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, paragraph 6, treatment because the term
 circuit, combined with a description of the function of the circuit, connoted
 sufficient structure to one of ordinary skill in the art.); *Linear Tech.
 Corp. v. Impala Linear Corp.,* 379 F.3d 1311, 1321, 72 USPQ2d 1065, 1071
 (Fed. Cir. 2004); *Apex,* 325 F.3d at 1373, 66 USPQ2d at 1452;
 *Greenberg,* 91 F.3d at 1583-84, 39 USPQ2d at 1786;
 *Personalized Media,* 161 F.3d at 704-05, 39 USPQ2d at 1786;
 *CCS Fitness,* 288 F.3d at 1369-70, 62 USPQ2d at 1664-65;

 Corp. v. VSI Int’l, Inc.,* 174 F.3d 1308, 1318-19, 50 USPQ2d 1161,
 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 1999). 
 


 For a term to be considered a substitute for "means,"
 and lack sufficient structure for performing the function, it must serve as a generic
 placeholder and thus not limit the scope of the claim to any specific manner or
 structure for performing the claimed function. It is important to remember that there
 are no absolutes in the determination of terms used as a substitute for "means" that
 serve as generic placeholders. The examiner must carefully consider the term in light
 of the specification and the commonly accepted meaning in the technological art.
 Every application will turn on its own facts. 
 


If the examiner has not interpreted a claim limitation
 as invoking **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** and an applicant
 wishes to have the claim limitation treated under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applicant must either: (A) amend the claim to include
 the phrase "means" or "step"; or (B) rebut the presumption that **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** does not apply by showing that the claim limitation is
 written as a function to be performed and does not recite sufficient structure,
 material, or acts to perform that function. See *Watts,* 232 F.3d at
 881, 56 USPQ2d at 1839 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Claim limitations were held not to invoke
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, because the absence of the term "means"
 raised the presumption that the limitations were not in means-plus-function form and
 the applicant did not rebut that presumption.); see also *Masco Corp. v.
 United States,* 303 F.3d 1316, 1327, 64 USPQ2d 1182, 1189 (Fed. Cir.
 2002) ("[W]here a method claim does not contain the term ‘step[s] for,’ a limitation
 of that claim cannot be construed as a step-plus-function limitation without a
 showing that the limitation contains no act.").
 


Some of the following examples illustrate situations where the term
 "means" or "step" was not used but either the Board or courts nevertheless determined
 that the claim limitation fell within the scope of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**. Note that the examples are fact specific and should not
 be applied as *per se* rules. See *Signtech USA, Ltd. v.
 Vutek, Inc.,* 174 F.3d 1352, 1356, 50 USPQ2d 1372, 1374–75 (Fed.
 Cir.1999) ("ink delivery means positioned on …" invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,

 delivery"); *Seal-Flex, Inc. v. Athletic Track and Court
 Construction,* 172 F.3d 836, 850, 50 USPQ2d 1225, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 1999)
 (Rader, J., concurring) ("Claim elements without express step-plus-function language
 may nevertheless fall within **[Section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, Para. 6 if they

 function…. In general terms, the ‘underlying function’ of a method claim element
 corresponds to *what* that element ultimately accomplishes in
 relationship to what the other elements of the claim and the claim as a whole
 accomplish. ‘Acts,’ on the other hand, correspond to *how* the
 function is accomplished…. If the claim element uses the phrase ‘step for,’ then

 since the claimed limitations were described in terms of their function rather than
 their mechanical structure); *Ethicon, Inc. v. United States Surgical

 When applicant uses the term "means" or "step" in the
 preamble, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** may be
 appropriate when it is unclear whether the preamble is reciting a means- (or step-)
 plus- function limitation or whether the preamble is merely stating the intended use
 of the claimed invention. When applicant merely states an intended use of the claimed
 invention in the preamble (e.g., "A device for printing, comprising ..."), the
 examiner should not construe such language as reciting a means-plus-function
 limitation.
 


The examiner is reminded that, absent a determination
 that a claim limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**, the broadest
 reasonable interpretation will not be limited to "corresponding structure… and
 equivalents thereof." *Morris,* 127 F.3d at 1055, 44 USPQ2d at 1028
 ("no comparable mandate in the patent statute that relates the claim scope of non-§
 112 paragraph 6 claims to particular matter found in the specification").
 

***B.******The Term "Means" or "Step" or the Generic Placeholder Must Be Modified By
 Functional Language***With respect to the second prong of this analysis, it must be clear
 that the element in the claims is set forth, at least in part, by the function it
 performs as opposed to the specific structure, material, or acts that perform the
 function. See *York Prod., Inc. v. Central Tractor Farm & Family
 Center,* 99 F.3d 1568, 1574, 40 USPQ2d 1619, 1624 (Fed. Cir. 1996)
 (holding that a claim limitation containing the term "means" does not invoke
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, if the claim limitation does not
 link the term "means" to a specific function); *Caterpillar Inc. v. Detroit
 Diesel Corp.,* 961 F.Supp. 1249, 1255, 41 USPQ2d 1876, 1882 (N.D. Ind.
 1996) (stating that **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, "applies to functional
 method claims where the element at issue sets forth a step for reaching a particular
 result, but not the specific technique or procedure used to achieve the
 result."); *O.I. Corp.,* 115 F.3d at 1582-83, 42 USPQ2d at 1782
 (With respect to process claims, "[**[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph] is implicated only when steps *plus function* without
 acts are present…. If we were to construe every process claim containing steps
 described by an ‘ing’ verb, such as passing, heating, reacting, transferring, etc.,
 into a step-plus-function, we would be limiting process claims in a manner never
 intended by Congress." (emphasis in original)); see also *Baran v. Medical
 Device Techs., Inc.,* 616 F.3d 1309, 1317, 96 USPQ2d 1057, 1063 (Fed.
 Cir. 2010) (the claimed function may include the functional language that precedes
 the phrase "means for."). However, "the fact that a particular mechanism…is defined
 in functional terms is not sufficient to convert a claim element containing that term
 into a ‘means for performing a specified function’ within the meaning of
 **[section
 112(6)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**." *Greenberg v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery,
 Inc.,* 91 F.3d 1580, 1583, 39 USPQ2d 1783, 1786 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("detent
 mechanism" defined in functional terms was not intended to invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 sixth paragraph); see also *Al-Site Corp. v. VSI International
 Inc.,* 174 F.3d 1308, 1318, 50 USPQ2d 1161, 1166–67 (Fed. Cir. 1999)
 (although the claim elements "eyeglass hanger member" and "eyeglass contacting
 member" include a function, these claim elements do not invoke **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, because the claims themselves contain
 sufficient structural limitations for performing those functions). Also, a statement
 of function appearing only in the claim preamble is generally insufficient to invoke
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**. *O.I. Corp.,* 115 F.3d at 1583,
 42 USPQ2d at 1782 ("[A] statement in a preamble of a result that necessarily follows
 from performing a series of steps does not convert each of those steps into step-
 plus-function clauses. The steps of ‘passing’ are not individually associated in the
 claims with functions performed by the steps of passing."). 
 


The mere use of the term "means" with no associated
 function rebuts the presumption that **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** is invoked. A
 function must be recited within the claim limitation, but it is not necessary that a
 particular format be used. Typically, the claim limitation will use the linking word
 "for" to associate "means" or a generic placeholder with the function. However, other
 linking words may be used, such as "so that" or "configured to", provided it is clear
 that the claim element is reciting a function. In certain circumstances, it is also
 not necessary to use a linking word if other words used with "means", or the generic
 placeholder, convey the function. Such words, however, cannot convey specific
 structure for performing the function or the phrase will not be treated as invoking
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**. For example, "ink delivery means", "module
 configured to deliver ink" and "means for ink delivery" could all be interpreted as
 claim elements that invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**. See
 *Signtech USA,* 174 F.3d at 1356.
 

***C.******The Term "Means" or "Step" or the Generic Placeholder Must Not Be
 Modified By Sufficient Structure, Material, or Acts for Achieving the Specified
 Function***With respect to the third prong of this analysis, the term "means"
 or "step" or the generic placeholder recited in the claim must not be modified by
 sufficiently definite structure, material, or acts for achieving the specified
 function. See *Seal-Flex,* 172 F.3d at 849, 50 USPQ2d at 1234
 (Radar, J., concurring) ("Even when a claim element uses language that generally
 falls under the step-plus-function format, however, **[[35 U.S.C.] 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**
 ¶ 6 still does not apply when the claim limitation itself recites sufficient acts for
 performing the specified function."); *Envirco Corp. v. Clestra Cleanroom,
 Inc.,* 209 F.3d 1360, 54 USPQ2d 1449 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding "second
 baffle means" does not invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 because the word "baffle" itself imparts structure and the claim further recites the
 structure of the baffle); *Rodime PLC v. Seagate Technology, Inc.,*
 174 F.3d 1294, 1303–04, 50 USPQ2d 1429, 1435–36 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding
 "positioning means for moving" does not invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 because the claim further provides a list of the structure underlying the means and
 the detailed recitation of the structure for performing the moving function removes
 this element from the purview of **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph);
 *Cole v. Kimberly-Clark Corp.,* 102 F.3d 524, 531, 41 USPQ2d
 1001, 1006 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding "perforation means…for tearing" does not invoke
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, because the claim describes the structure
 supporting the tearing function (i.e., perforation)). In other situations, the
 Federal Circuit has come to a different conclusion. See *Unidynamics Corp. v.
 Automatic Prod. Int’l,* 157 F.3d 1311, 1319, 48 USPQ2d 1099, 1104 (Fed.
 Cir. 1998) (holding that "spring means" invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph).
 


Examiners will apply **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** to a claim limitation that uses the term "means" or
 generic placeholder associated with functional language, unless that term is (1)
 preceded by a structural modifier, defined in the specification as a particular
 structure or known by one skilled in the art, that denotes the type of structural
 device (e.g., "filters"), or (2) otherwise modified by sufficient structure or
 material for achieving the claimed function. Similarly, examiners will apply
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** to a claim limitation that uses the term "step
 for" unless that term is modified by sufficient acts for performing the claimed
 function. 
 


A limitation will not invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** if there is a structural modifier that further describes
 the term "means" or the generic placeholder. For example, although a generic
 placeholder like "mechanism" standing alone may invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** when coupled with a function, it will not invoke
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** when it is preceded by a structural modifier
 (e.g., "detent mechanism"). *Greenberg,* 91 F.3d at 1583, 39 USPQ2d
 at 1786 (holding that the term "detent mechanism" did not invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 sixth paragraph because the structural modifier "detent" denotes a type of structural
 device with a generally understood meaning in the mechanical arts). By contrast, a
 generic placeholder (e.g., "mechanism," "element," "member") coupled with a function
 may invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** when it is preceded by a non-structural
 modifier that does not have any generally understood structural meaning in the art
 (e.g., "colorant selection mechanism," "lever moving element," or "movable link
 member"). See *Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.,* 462 F.3d at 1354, 80
 USPQ2d at 1231 (The claim recited use of a colorant selection mechanism, to which the
 court performed a means-plus-function analysis under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph. The court held that the term "colorant
 selection", which modifies the generic term "mechanism", was not defined in the
 specification, had no dictionary definition, nor any generally understood meaning in
 the art, the term does not connote sufficient structure to a person of ordinary skill
 in the art to avoid **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph treatment.);
 *Mas-Hamilton,* 156 F.3d at 1214-1215, 48 USPQ2d at 1017; see
 also *Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC,* 792 F.3d 1339, 1351 (Fed.
 Cir. 2015) (determining that "[t]he prefix ‘distributed learning control’ does not
 impart any structural significance to the term [‘module’]"). 
 


To determine whether a word, term, or phrase coupled
 with a function denotes structure, examiners may check whether: (1) the specification
 provides a description sufficient to inform one of ordinary skill in the art that the
 term denotes structure; (2) general and subject matter specific dictionaries provide
 evidence that the term has achieved recognition as a noun denoting structure; and/or
 (3) the prior art provides evidence that the term is an art-recognized structure to
 perform the claimed function. *Ex parte Rodriguez,* 92 USPQ2d 1395,
 1404 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2009) (precedential). 
 


During examination, however, applicants have the
 opportunity and the obligation to define their inventions precisely, including
 whether a claim limitation invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**. Thus, if the
 term "means" or "step" or a generic placeholder is modified by sufficient structure,
 material or acts for achieving the specified function, the USPTO will consider that
 presumption has been rebutted and will not apply **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** until such modifying language is deleted from the claim
 limitation. 
 


It is necessary to decide on an element by element basis whether
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applies. Not all terms in a means-plus-function
 or step-plus-function clause are limited to what is disclosed in the written
 description and equivalents thereof, since **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applies only to the interpretation of the means or step
 that performs the recited function. See, e.g., *IMS Technology Inc. v. Haas
 Automation Inc.,* 206 F.3d 1422, 54 USPQ2d 1129 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the
 term "data block" in the phrase "means to sequentially display data block inquiries"
 was not the means that caused the sequential display, and its meaning was not limited
 to the disclosed embodiment and equivalents thereof). Each claim must be
 independently reviewed to determine the applicability of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** even where the application contains substantially
 similar process and apparatus claims. *O.I. Corp.,* 115 F.3d at
 1583-1584, 42 USPQ2d at 1782 ("We understand that the steps in the method claims are
 essentially in the same language as the limitations in the apparatus claim, albeit
 without the ‘means for’ qualification…. Each claim must be independently reviewed in
 order to determine if it is subject to the requirements of **[section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, ¶
 6. Interpretation of claims would be confusing indeed if claims that are not means-
 or step- plus function were to be interpreted as if they were, only because they use
 language similar to that used in other claims that are subject to this
 provision.").
 

**II.** **DESCRIPTION NECESSARY TO SUPPORT A CLAIM LIMITATION WHICH INVOKES 35 U.S.C.
 112(f) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, SIXTH PARAGRAPH****[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** states that a claim limitation expressed in means- (or
 step-) plus-function language "shall be construed to cover the corresponding
 structure…described in the specification and equivalents thereof." "If one employs means
 plus function language in a claim, one must set forth in the specification an adequate
 disclosure showing what is meant by that language. If an applicant fails to set forth an
 adequate disclosure, the applicant has in effect failed to particularly point out and
 distinctly claim the invention as required by the **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** [or the second paragraph of **[pre-AIA section
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**]." *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d 1189, 1195,
 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1850 (Fed. Cir. 1994) *(en banc)*.
 

***A.******The Corresponding Structure Must Be Disclosed In the Specification Itself
 in a Way That One Skilled In the Art Will Understand What Structure Will
 Perform the Recited Function***The proper test for meeting the definiteness requirement is that the
 corresponding structure (or material or acts) of a means- (or step-) plus-function
 limitation must be disclosed in the specification itself in a way that one skilled in
 the art will understand what structure (or material or acts) will perform the recited
 function. See *Atmel Corp. v. Information Storage Devices, Inc.,*
 198 F.3d 1374, 1381, 53 USPQ2d 1225, 1230 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In
 *Atmel,* the patentee claimed an apparatus that included a "high
 voltage generating means" limitation, thereby invoking **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 sixth paragraph. The specification incorporated by reference a non-patent document
 from a technical journal, which described a particular high voltage generating
 circuit. The Federal Circuit concluded that the title of the article in the
 specification may, by itself, be sufficient to indicate to one skilled in the art the
 precise structure of the means for performing the recited function, and it remanded
 the case to the district court "to consider the knowledge of one skilled in the art
 that indicated, based on unrefuted testimony, that the specification disclosed
 sufficient structure corresponding to the high-voltage means limitation."
 *Id.* at 1382, 53 USPQ2d at 1231.
 


 If there is no disclosure of structure, material or acts for
 performing the recited function, the claim fails to satisfy the requirements of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. The disclosure of the structure (or material or
 acts) may be implicit or inherent in the specification if it would have been clear to
 those skilled in the art what structure (or material or acts) corresponds to the
 means- (or step-) plus-function claim limitation. See *id.* at 1380,
 53 USPQ2d at 1229; *In re Dossel,* 115 F.3d 942, 946-47, 42 USPQ2d
 1881, 1885 (Fed. Cir. 1997). However, "[a] bare statement that known techniques or
 methods can be used does not disclose structure" in the context of a means plus
 function limitation. *Biomedino, LLC v. Waters Technology Corp.,*
 490 F.3d 946, 952, 83 USPQ2d 1118, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (Disclosure that an
 invention "may be controlled by known differential pressure, valving and control
 equipment" was not a disclosure of any structure corresponding to the claimed
 "control means for operating [a] valving " and the claim was held indefinite). See
 also *Budde v. Harley-Davidson, Inc.,* 250 F.3d 1369, 1376, 58
 USPQ2d 1801, 1806 (Fed. Cir. 2001); *Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. v. St. Jude
 Med., Inc*., 296 F.3d 1106, 1115-18, 63 USPQ2d 1725, 1731-34 (Fed. Cir.
 2002) (Court interpreted the language of the "third monitoring means for monitoring
 the ECG signal…for activating …" to require the same means to perform both functions
 and the only entity referenced in the specification that could possibly perform both
 functions is the physician. The court held that excluding the physician, no structure
 accomplishes the claimed dual functions. Because no structure disclosed in the
 embodiments of the invention actually performs the claimed dual functions, the
 specification lacks corresponding structure as required by **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 sixth paragraph, and fails to comply with **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.).
 


Whether a claim reciting an element in means- (or step-)
 plus-function language fails to comply with **[35 U.S.C.

 paragraph, because the specification does not disclose adequate structure (or
 material or acts) for performing the recited function is closely related to the
 question of whether the specification meets the description requirement in
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. See *In re Noll,* 545 F.2d 141, 149, 191 USPQ 721, 727
 (CCPA 1976) (unless the means-plus-function language is itself unclear, a claim
 limitation written in means-plus- function language meets the definiteness
 requirement in **[35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, so long as the specification
 meets the written description requirement in **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph).
 *In Aristocrat Techs. Australia PTY Ltd. v. Int’l Game Tech.,*
 521 F.3d 1328, 1336-37, 86 USPQ2d 1235, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the court stated:

The invocation of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** does not exempt an applicant from compliance with

Under certain limited circumstances, the written description does
 not have to explicitly describe the structure (or material or acts) corresponding to
 a means- (or step-) plus-function limitation to particularly point out and distinctly
 claim the invention as required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or

 would have been clear to those skilled in the art what structure must perform the
 function recited in the means-plus-function limitation. See *Atmel Corp. v.
 Information Storage Devices Inc.,* 198 F.3d 1374, 1379, 53 USPQ2d 1225,
 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (stating that the "one skilled in the art" analysis should
 apply in determining whether sufficient structure has been disclosed to support a
 means-plus-function limitation); *Dossel,* 115 F.3d at 946–47, 42
 USPQ2d at 1885 ("Clearly, a unit which receives digital data, performs complex
 mathematical computations and outputs the results to a display must be implemented by
 or on a general or special purpose computer (although it is not clear why the written
 description does not simply state ‘computer’ or some equivalent phrase)."). 
 


A claim may also be indefinite when the 3-prong
 analysis for determining whether the claim limitation should be interpreted under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** is inconclusive because of ambiguous words in the
 claim. After taking into consideration the language in the claims, the specification,
 and how those of ordinary skill in the art would understand the language in the
 claims in light of the disclosure, the examiner should make a determination regarding
 whether the words in the claim recite sufficiently definite structure that performs
 the claimed function. If the applicant disagrees with the examiner’s interpretation
 of the claim limitation, the applicant has the opportunity during the application
 process to present arguments, and amend the claim if needed, to clarify whether
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applies.
 

***B.******Computer-Implemented Means-Plus-Function Limitations***For a computer-implemented **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** claim limitation, the specification must disclose an
 algorithm for performing the claimed specific computer function, or else the claim is
 indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**(b). See
 *Net MoneyIN, Inc. v. Verisign. Inc.,* 545 F.3d 1359, 1367 (Fed.
 Cir. 2008). See also *In re Aoyama,* 656 F.3d 1293, 1297, 99 USPQ2d
 1936, 1939 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ("[W]hen the disclosed structure is a computer programmed
 to carry out an algorithm, ‘the disclosed structure is not the general purpose
 computer, but rather that special purpose computer programmed to perform the
 disclosed algorithm.’") (quoting *WMS Gaming, Inc. v. Int’l Game
 Tech.,* 184 F.3d 1339, 1349, 51 USPQ2d 1385, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).
 


 In cases involving a special purpose
 computer-implemented means-plus-function limitation, the Federal Circuit has
 consistently required that the structure be more than simply a general purpose
 computer or microprocessor and that the specification must disclose an algorithm for
 performing the claimed function. See, e.g., *Noah Systems Inc. v. Intuit
 Inc.,* 675 F.3d 1302, 1312, 102 USPQ2d 1410, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 2012);
 *Aristocrat,* 521 F.3d at 1333, 86 USPQ2d at 1239. 
 


For a computer-implemented means-plus-function claim
 limitation invoking **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** the Federal
 Circuit has stated that "a microprocessor can serve as structure for a
 computer-implemented function only where the claimed function is ‘coextensive’ with a
 microprocessor itself." *EON Corp. IP Holdings LLC v. AT&T Mobility
 LLC,* 785 F.3d 616, 622, citing *In re Katz Interactive Call
 Processing Patent Litigation,* 639 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2011). "‘It
 is only in the rare circumstances where any general-purpose computer without any
 special programming can perform the function that an algorithm need not be
 disclosed.’" *EON Corp.,* 785 F.3d at 621, quoting *Ergo
 Licensing, LLC v. CareFusion* 303, Inc., 673 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir.
 2012). "‘[S]pecial programming’ includes any functionality that is not ‘coextensive’
 with a microprocessor or general purpose computer." *EON Corp.,* 785
 F.3d at 623 (citations omitted). "Examples of such coextensive functions are
 ‘receiving’ data, ‘storing’ data, and ‘processing’ data—the only three functions on
 which the Katz court vacated the district court’s decision and remanded for the
 district court to determine whether disclosure of a microprocessor was sufficient."
 *Id.* at 622. Thus, "[a] microprocessor or general purpose
 computer lends sufficient structure only to basic functions of a microprocessor. All
 other computer-implemented functions require disclosure of an algorithm."
 *Id.*


 To claim a means for performing a specific
 computer-implemented function and then to disclose only a general purpose computer as
 the structure designed to perform that function amounts to pure functional claiming.
 *Aristocrat,* 521 F.3d 1328 at 1333, 86 USPQ2d at 1239. In this
 instance, the structure corresponding to a **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** claim limitation for a computer-implemented function
 must include the algorithm needed to transform the general purpose computer or
 microprocessor disclosed in the specification. *Aristocrat,* 521
 F.3d at 1333, 86 USPQ2d at 1239; *Finisar Corp. v. DirecTV Group,
 Inc.,* 523 F.3d 1323, 1340, 86 USPQ2d 1609, 1623 (Fed. Cir. 2008);
 *WMS Gaming, Inc. v. Int’l Game Tech.,* 184 F.3d 1339, 1349, 51
 USPQ2d 1385, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The corresponding structure is not simply a
 general purpose computer by itself but the special purpose computer as programmed to
 perform the disclosed algorithm. *Aristocrat,* 521 F.3d at 1333, 86
 USPQ2d at 1239. Thus, the specification must sufficiently disclose an algorithm to
 transform a general purpose microprocessor to the special purpose computer. See
 *Aristocrat,* 521 F.3d at 1338, 86 USPQ2d at 1241. ("Aristocrat
 was not required to produce a listing of source code or a highly detailed description
 of the algorithm to be used to achieve the claimed functions in order to satisfy
 **[35 U.S.C. §
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** ¶ 6. It was required, however, to at least disclose the
 algorithm that transforms the general purpose microprocessor to a ‘special purpose
 computer programmed to perform the disclosed algorithm.’" (quoting *WMS
 Gaming,* 184 F.3d at 1349, 51 USPQ2d at 1391.)) An algorithm is defined,
 for example, as "a finite sequence of steps for solving a logical or mathematical
 problem or performing a task." Microsoft Computer Dictionary, Microsoft Press, 5th
 edition, 2002. Applicant may express the algorithm in any understandable terms
 including as a mathematical formula, in prose, in a flow chart, or "in any other
 manner that provides sufficient structure." *Finisar,* 523 F.3d at
 1340, 86 USPQ2d at 1623; see also *Intel Corp. v. VIA Techs., Inc*.,
 319 F.3d 1357, 1366, 65 USPQ2d 1934, 1941 (Fed. Cir. 2003); *In re

The Federal Circuit case law regarding special purpose
 computer-implemented means-plus-function claims is divided into two distinct groups.
 The first group includes cases in which the specification discloses no algorithm, and
 the second group includes cases in which the specification does disclose an
 algorithm, but an issue exists as to whether the disclosure is adequate to perform
 the entire claimed function(s). The sufficiency of the algorithm is determined in
 view of what one of ordinary skill in the art would understand as sufficient to
 define the structure and make the boundaries of the claim understandable. See
 *Noah,* 675 F.3d at 1313, 102 USPQ2d at 1417.
 


Accordingly, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is appropriate if the specification discloses no corresponding algorithm
 associated with a computer or microprocessor. *Aristocrat,* 521 F.3d
 at 1337-38, 86 USPQ2d at 1242. For example, in *Advanced Ground Information
 Systems, Inc. v. Life360, Inc.,* 830 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2016), the
 Federal Circuit determined that the term "symbol generator" is a computer-implemented
 means-plus- function limitation and that "[t]he specifications of the patents-in-suit
 do not disclose an operative algorithm for the claim elements reciting ‘symbol
 generator.’" *Id.* at 1348-49. The Federal Circuit upheld the
 district court’s determination that the term "symbol generator" is indefinite,
 observing that "although the district court recognized that the specification
 describes, in general terms, that symbols are generated based on the latitude and
 longitude of the participants, it nonetheless determined that the specification fails
 to disclose an algorithm or description as to how those symbols are actually
 generated." *Id.* at 1349 (internal quotation marks and alterations
 omitted). See also, *Blackboard, Inc. v. Desire2Learn, Inc.,* 574
 F.3d 1371, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (concluding that the description of a server
 computer’s "access control manager" software feature was insufficient disclosure of
 corresponding structure to support the computer-implemented "means for assigning"
 limitation because "what the patent calls the ‘access control manager’ is simply an
 abstraction that describes the function of controlling access to course materials …
 [b]ut how it does so is left undisclosed."); *Aristocrat,* 521 F.3d
 at 1334-35 (explaining that "the [patent’s] description of the embodiments is simply
 a description of the outcome of the claimed functions, not a description of the
 structure, i.e., the computer programmed to execute a particular algorithm").
 


Mere reference to a general purpose computer with
 appropriate programming without providing an explanation of the appropriate
 programming, or simply reciting "software" without providing detail about the means
 to accomplish a specific software function, would not be an adequate disclosure of
 the corresponding structure to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. *Aristocrat,* 521 F.3d at 1334, 86 USPQ2d at 1239;
 *Finisar,* 523 F.3d at 1340-41, 86 USPQ2d at 1623. In addition,
 merely referencing a specialized computer (e.g., a "bank computer"), some undefined
 component of a computer system (e.g., "access control manager"), "logic," "code," or
 elements that are essentially a black box designed to perform the recited function,
 will not be sufficient because there must be some explanation of how the computer or
 the computer component performs the claimed function. *Blackboard, Inc. v.
 Desire2Learn, Inc.,* 574 F.3d 1371, 1383-85, 91 USPQ2d 1481, 1491-93
 (Fed. Cir. 2009); *Net MoneyIN, Inc. v. VeriSign, Inc.,* 545 F.3d
 1359, 1366-67, 88 USPQ2d 1751, 1756-57 (Fed. Cir. 2008);
 *Rodriguez,* 92 USPQ2d at 1405-06. 
 


If the specification explicitly discloses an
 algorithm, the sufficiency of the disclosure of the algorithm must be determined in
 light of the level of ordinary skill in the art. *Aristocrat,* 521
 F.3d at 1337, 86 USPQ2d at 1241; *AllVoice Computing PLC v. Nuance Commc’ns,
 Inc.,* 504 F.3d 1236, 1245, 84 USPQ2d 1886, 1893 (Fed. Cir. 2007);
 *Intel Corp.,* 319 F.3d at 1366-67, 65 USPQ2d 1934, 1941
 (knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art can be used to make clear how to
 implement a disclosed algorithm). The examiner should determine whether one skilled
 in the art would know how to program the computer to perform the necessary steps
 described in the specification (i.e., the invention is enabled), and that the
 inventor was in possession of the invention (i.e., the invention meets the written
 description requirement). Thus, the specification must sufficiently disclose an
 algorithm to transform a general purpose microprocessor to a special purpose computer
 so that a person of ordinary skill in the art can implement the disclosed algorithm
 to achieve the claimed function. *Aristocrat,* 521 F.3d at 1338, 86
 USPQ2d at 1242.
 


 See *Noah,* 675 F.3d at 1319
 (holding that "[c]omputer- implemented means-plus- function claims are indefinite
 unless the specification discloses an algorithm to perform the function associated
 with the limitation[,]" and that "[w]hen the specification discloses an algorithm
 that only accomplishes one of multiple identifiable functions performed by a
 means-plus- function limitation, the specification is treated as if it disclosed no
 algorithm."). 
 


 The sufficiency of the algorithm is determined in
 view of what one of ordinary skill in the art would understand as sufficient to
 define the structure and make the boundaries of the claim understandable. For
 example, in *Williamson,* the Federal Circuit found that the term
 "distributed learning control module" is a means-plus- function limitation that
 performs three specialized functions (*i.e.,* "receiving,",
 "relaying," and "coordinating"), which "must be implemented in a special purpose
 computer." *Williamson,* 792 F.3d at 1351-52. The Federal Circuit
 explained that "[w]here there are multiple claimed functions, as we have here, the
 [specification] must disclose adequate corresponding structure to perform a l of the
 claimed functions." *Id.* Yet the Federal Circuit determined that
 the specification "fails to disclose any structure corresponding to the
 ‘coordinating’ function." *Id.* at 1354. Specifically, the Federal
 Circuit found no "disclosure of an algorithm corresponding to the claimed
 ‘coordinating’ function," concluding that the figures in the specification relied
 upon by patentee as disclosing the required algorithm, instead describe "a presenter
 display interface" and not an algorithm corresponding to the claimed "coordinating"
 function. *Id.* at 1353-54. Accordingly, the Federal Circuit
 affirmed the district court’s judgment that claims containing the "distributed
 learning control module" limitation are invalid for indefiniteness under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. *Id.* at 1354.
 


Similarly in *Media Rights Technologies, Inc.
 v. Capital One Financial Corp.,* 800 F.3d 1366, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2015),
 the Federal Circuit determined that the term ‘‘compliance mechanism’’ is a
 means-plus-function limitation that performs four computer implemented functions
 (*i.e.,* "controlling data output by diverting a data pathway;
 monitoring the controlled data pathway; managing an output path by diverting a data
 pathway; and stopping the play of media content"). The Federal Circuit determined
 "that the specification fails to adequately disclose the structure to perform all
 four of [the ‘compliance mechanism’s’] functions" and affirmed the district court’s
 decision that the "compliance mechanism" limitation is indefinite.
 *Id.* at 1375. Specifically, the Federal Circuit found that "the
 specification fails to disclose an operative algorithm for both the ‘controlling data
 output’ and ‘managing output path’ functions[,]" which ‘‘both require diverting a
 data pathway[,]" because the recited C++ source code in the specification "only
 returns various error messages" and "does not, accordingly, explain how to perform
 the diverting function[.]" *Id.* at 1374–75. "Additionally, the
 specification does not disclose sufficient structure for the ‘monitoring’
 function[,]" because the disclosed "set of rules . . . which the ‘copyright
 compliance mechanism’ applies to monitor the data pathway to ensure there is no
 unauthorized recording of electronic media . . . provides no detail about the rules
 themselves or how the ‘copyright compliance mechanism’ determines whether the rules
 are being enforced." *Id.* at 1375. 
 


In several Federal Circuit cases, the patentees argued
 that the requirement for the disclosure of an algorithm can be avoided if one of
 ordinary skill in the art is capable of writing the software to convert a general
 purpose computer to a special purpose computer to perform the claimed function. See,
 e.g., *Blackboard,* 574 F.3d at 1385, 91 USPQ2d at 1493;
 *Biomedino,* 490 F.3d at 952, 83 USPQ2d at 1123; *Atmel
 Corp.,* 198 F.3d at 1380, 53 USPQ2d at 1229. Such argument was found to
 be unpersuasive because the understanding of one skilled in the art does not relieve
 the patentee of the duty to disclose sufficient structure to support
 means-plus-function claim terms. *Blackboard,* 574 F.3d at 1385, 91
 USPQ2d at 1493 ("A patentee cannot avoid providing specificity as to structure simply
 because someone of ordinary skill in the art would be able to devise a means to
 perform the claimed function."); *Atmel Corp.,* 198 F.3d at 1380, 53
 USPQ2d at 1229 ("[C]onsideration of the understanding of one skilled in the art in no
 way relieves the patentee of adequately disclosing sufficient structure in the
 specification."). The specification must explicitly disclose the algorithm for
 performing the claimed function, and simply reciting the claimed function in the
 specification will not be a sufficient disclosure for an algorithm which, by
 definition, must contain a sequence of steps. *Blackboard,* 574 F.3d
 at 1384, 91 USPQ2d at 1492 (stating that language that simply describes the function
 to be performed describes an outcome, not a means for achieving that outcome);
 Microsoft Computer Dictionary, Microsoft Press, 5th edition, 2002; see also
 *Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. v. Alpine Elecs., Inc.,* 355 Fed.
 App'x 389, 394-95 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that implicit or inherent disclosure of a
 class of algorithms for performing the claimed functions is not sufficient, and the
 purported "one-step" algorithm is not an algorithm at all) (unpublished).
 *EON Corp. IP Holdings LLC v. AT&T Mobility LLC,* 785 F.3d
 616, 623 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (disagreeing "that a microprocessor can serve as sufficient
 structure for a software function if a person of ordinary skill in the art could
 implement the software function"); *Blackboard,* 574 F.3d at 1385
 (explaining that "[t]he fact that an ordinarily skilled artisan might be able to
 design a program to create an access control list based on the system users’
 predetermined roles goes to enablement[,]" whereas "[t]he question before us is
 whether the specification contains a sufficiently precise description of the
 ‘corresponding structure’ to satisfy [pre-AIA] **[section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, paragraph 6, not
 whether a person of skill in the art could devise some means to carry out the recited
 function").
 


Often the supporting disclosure for a
 computer-implemented invention discusses the implementation of the functionality of
 the invention through hardware, software, or a combination of both. In this
 situation, a question can arise as to which mode of implementation supports the
 means-plus-function limitation. The language of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** requires that the recited "means" for performing the
 specified function shall be construed to cover the corresponding "structure or
 material" described in the specification and equivalents thereof. Therefore, by
 choosing to use a means-plus-function limitation and invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applicant limits that claim limitation to the disclosed
 structure, i.e., implementation by hardware or the combination of hardware and
 software, and equivalents thereof. Therefore, the examiner should not construe the
 limitation as covering pure software implementation. 
 


However, if there is no corresponding structure
 disclosed in the specification (i.e., the limitation is only supported by software
 and does not correspond to an algorithm and the computer or microprocessor programmed
 with the algorithm), the limitation should be deemed indefinite as discussed above,
 and the claim should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. It is important to remember that
 claims must be interpreted as a whole; so, a claim that includes a
 means-plus-function limitation that corresponds to software per se (and is thus
 indefinite for lacking structural support in the specification) is not necessarily
 directed as a whole to software per se unless the claim lacks other structural
 limitations. 
 


 As noted below in subsection III., if it is unclear
 whether there is sufficient supporting structure or whether the algorithm is adequate
 to perform the entire claimed function, it is appropriate to reject the claim under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph.
 


When a claim containing a computer-implemented
 **[35

 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** for failure to disclose sufficient corresponding
 structure (e.g., the computer and the algorithm) in the specification that performs
 the entire claimed function, it will also lack written description under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. See **[MPEP § 2163.03](s2163.html#d0e214623)**, subsection VI.
 Examiners should further consider whether the disclosure contains sufficient
 information regarding the subject matter of the claims as to enable one skilled in
 the pertinent art to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention in
 compliance with the enablement requirement of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. See **[MPEP § 2161.01](s2161.html#d0e213447)**, subsection III, and
 **[MPEP §
 2164.08](s2164.html#d0e216700)**.
 

***C.******The Supporting Disclosure Clearly Links or Associates the Disclosed
 Structure, Material, or Acts to the Claimed Function***The structure disclosed in the written description of
 the specification is the corresponding structure only if the written description of
 the specification or the prosecution history **clearly links or associates**

 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The requirement that a particular structure be clearly linked with
 the claimed function in order to qualify as corresponding structure is the
 *quid pro quo* for the convenience of employing **[35 U.S.C.

 means-plus-function limitation invoking **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, the examiner should determine the claimed
 function and then review the written description of the specification to determine
 whether the corresponding structure, material, or acts that perform the claimed function
 are disclosed. Note that drawings may provide a written description of an invention as
 required by **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**. See *Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d
 1555, 1565, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The corresponding structure,
 material, or acts may be disclosed in the original drawings, figures, tables, or
 sequence listing. However, the corresponding structure, material, or acts cannot include
 any structure, material, or acts disclosed only in the material incorporated by
 reference or a prior art reference. See *Pressure Prods. Med. Supplies, Inc. v.
 Greatbatch Ltd.,* 599 F.3d 1308, 1317, 94 USPQ2d 1261, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2010)
 (stating, "[s]imply mentioning prior art references in a patent does not suffice as a
 specification description to give the patentee outright claim to all of the structures
 disclosed in those references."); *Atmel Corp. v. Info. Storage Devices,
 Inc.,* 198 F.3d 1374, 1381, 53 USPQ2d 1225, 1230 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The
 disclosure must be reviewed from the point of view of one skilled in the relevant art to
 determine whether that person would understand the written description to disclose the
 corresponding structure, material, or acts. *Tech. Licensing Corp. v. Videotek,
 Inc.,* 545 F.3d 1316, 1338, 88 USPQ2d 1865, 1879 (Fed. Cir. 2008);

 F.3d 1205, 1211-12, 68 USPQ2d 1263, 1269 (Fed. Cir. 2003). To satisfy the definiteness
 requirement under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, the written description must clearly link
 or associate the corresponding structure, material, or acts to the claimed function.

 1376, 95 USPQ2d 1673, 1682 (Fed. Cir. 2010). A rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph is appropriate if the written description fails to link or associate the
 disclosed structure, material, or acts to the claimed function, or if there is no
 disclosure (or insufficient disclosure) of structure, material, or acts for performing
 the claimed function. *Donaldson,* 16 F.3d at 1195, 29 USPQ2d at 1850.
 A bare statement that known techniques or methods can be used would not be a sufficient
 disclosure to support a means-plus-function limitation. *Biomedino, LLC v.
 Waters Techs. Corp.,* 490 F.3d 946, 953, 83 USPQ2d 1118, 1123 (Fed. Cir.
 2007). 
 


A rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph may be appropriate in the following situations when examining
 means-plus-function claim limitations under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph:
 


* (1) when it is unclear whether a claim limitation
 invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph;
* (2) when **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph is invoked and there is no disclosure or there is insufficient
 disclosure of structure, material, or acts for performing the claimed function;
 and/or
* (3) when **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph is invoked and the supporting disclosure fails to clearly link or
 associate the disclosed structure, material, or acts to the claimed function.


A claim may be indefinite when the 3-prong analysis for
 determining whether the claim limitation should be interpreted under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** is inconclusive because of ambiguous words in the claim.
 After taking into consideration the language in the claims, the specification, and how
 those of ordinary skill in the art would understand the language in the claims in light
 of the disclosure, the examiner should make a determination regarding whether the words
 in the claim recite sufficiently definite structure that performs the claimed function.
 If the applicant disagrees with the examiner’s interpretation of the claim limitation,
 the applicant has the opportunity during the examination process to present arguments,
 and amend the claim if needed, to clarify whether **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applies.
 


 When the examiner cannot identify the corresponding
 structure, material, or acts, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph should be made. In some cases, a requirement for information under
 **[37 CFR
 1.105](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e322262)** may be made to require the identification of the
 corresponding structure, material, or acts. See **[MPEP § 704.11(a)](s704.html#d0e55998)**, Example R. If a
 requirement for information under **[37 CFR 1.105](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e322262)** is made and the
 applicant states that the applicant lacks such information or the reply does not
 identify the corresponding structure, material, or acts, a rejection under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph should be made. For more information, see **[MPEP § 704.12](s704.html#d0e56235)**
 ("Replies to requirements for information must be complete and filed within the time
 period set including any extensions. Failure to reply within the time period set will
 result in the abandonment of the application."). 
 


If the written description sets forth the corresponding
 structure, material, or acts in compliance with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, the claim limitation must "be construed to cover the corresponding structure,
 material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof."
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. However, functional limitations that are not recited in the claim, or
 structural limitations from the written description that are unnecessary to perform the
 claimed function, cannot be imported into the claim. *Welker Bearing,*
 550 F.3d at 1097, 89 USPQ2d at 1294; *Wenger Mfg., Inc. v. Coating Mach. Sys.,
 Inc.,* 239 F.3d 1225, 1233, 57 USPQ2d 1679, 1685 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 
 


The following guidance is provided to determine whether applicant has
 complied with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, when **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, is invoked: 
 


* (A) If the corresponding structure, material or acts are described in
 the specification in specific terms (e.g., an emitter-coupled voltage comparator),
 are linked to or associated with the claimed function and one skilled in the art
 could identify the structure, material or acts from that description as being
 adequate to perform the claimed function, then the requirements of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** and **[(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**
 or **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second and sixth paragraphs and are satisfied.
 See **Atmel,** 198 F.3d at 1382, 53 USPQ2d 1231.
* (B) If the corresponding structure, material or acts are described in
 the specification in broad generic terms and the specific details of which are
 incorporated by reference to another document (e.g., attachment means disclosed in
 U.S. Patent No. X, which is hereby incorporated by reference, or a comparator as
 disclosed in the Y article, which is hereby incorporated by reference), Office
 personnel must review the description in the specification, without relying on any
 material from the incorporated document, and apply the 
 "one skilled in the art"
 
 
 analysis to
 determine whether one skilled in the art could identify the corresponding
 structure (or material or acts) for performing the recited function to satisfy the
 definiteness requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. See *Default Proof
 Credit Card System, Inc. v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.,* 412 F.3d 1291,
 75 USPQ2d 1116 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("The inquiry under [35 U.S.C.] § 112, ¶ 2, does
 not turn on whether a patentee has ‘incorporated by reference’ material into the
 specification relating to structure, but instead asks first ‘whether structure is
 described in the specification, and, if so, whether one skilled in the art would
 identify the structure from that description.’").
	+ (1) If one skilled in the art would be able to identify the
	 structure, material or acts from the description in the specification for
	 performing the recited function, then the requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
	 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
	 second paragraph, are satisfied. See *Atmel Corp.* 198 F.3d
	 at 1379, 53 USPQ2d at 1228 (stating that the "one skilled in the art"
	 analysis should apply in determining whether sufficient structure has been
	 disclosed to support a means-plus-function limitation). See also
	 *Dossel,* 115 F.3d at 946-47, 42 USPQ2d at 1885 (The
	 function recited in the means-plus-function limitation involved
	 
	 "reconstructing"
	 
	 
	 
	 data. The issue was whether the structure underlying this
	 
	 "reconstructing"
	 
	 
	 
	 function was adequately described in the written description to satisfy
	 **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
	 **[pre-AIA
	 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph. The court stated that
	 
	 "[n]either the written description
	 nor the claims uses the magic word ‘computer,’ nor do they quote computer
	 code that may be used in the invention. Nevertheless, when the written
	 description is combined with claims 8 and 9, the disclosure satisfies the
	 requirements of **[Section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, Para.
	 2."
	 
	 
	 The court concluded that based on the specific
	 facts of the case, one skilled in the art would recognize the structure for
	 performing the 
	 "reconstructing"
	 
	 
	 function since 
	 "a unit which receives digital data, performs complex
	 mathematical computations and outputs the results to a display must be
	 implemented by or on a general or special purpose
	 computer."
	 
	 
	 ).
	+ (2) If one skilled in the art would not
	 be able to identify the structure, material or acts from description in the
	 specification for performing the recited function, then applicant will be
	 required to amend the specification to contain the material incorporated by
	 reference, including the clear link or associated structure, material or
	 acts to the function recited in the claim. See **[37 CFR
	 1.57(d)(3)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319590)**. Applicant should not be required to insert
	 all of the subject matter described in the entire referenced document into
	 the specification. To maintain a concise specification, applicant should
	 only include the relevant portions of the referenced document that
	 correspond to the means- (or step-) plus-function limitation.

**IV.** **DETERMINING WHETHER 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, FIRST PARAGRAPH
 SUPPORT EXISTS**A means- (or step-) plus-function limitation that is
 found to be indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** based on failure of
 the specification to disclose corresponding structure, material or act that performs the
 entire claimed function also lacks adequate written description and may not be
 sufficiently enabled to support the full scope of the claim. The principal function of
 claims is to provide notice of the boundaries of the right to exclude by defining the
 limits of the invention, and means-plus-function claims rely on the disclosure to define
 those limits. Accordingly, an inadequate disclosure may give rise to both an
 indefiniteness rejection for a means-plus-function limitation and a failure to satisfy
 the written description and enablement requirements of **[section
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. 
 


When a claim containing a computer-implemented
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** claim limitation is found to be indefinite under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** for failure to disclose sufficient corresponding structure
 (e.g., the computer and the algorithm) in the specification that performs the entire
 claimed function, it will also lack written description under **[section
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. See **[MPEP § 2163.03](s2163.html#d0e214623)**, subsection VI.
 Examiners should further consider whether the disclosure contains sufficient information
 regarding the subject matter of the claims as to enable one skilled in the pertinent art
 to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention in compliance with the
 enablement requirement of **[section 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2161.01](s2161.html#d0e213447)**, subsection III, and **[MPEP § 2164.08](s2164.html#d0e216700)**.
 


The Federal Circuit has recognized the problem of
 providing a sufficient disclosure for functional claiming, particularly with generic
 claim language, explaining that "The problem is especially acute with genus claims that
 use functional language to define the boundaries of a claimed genus. In such a case, the
 functional claim may simply claim a desired result, and may do so without describing
 species that achieve that result. But the specification must demonstrate that the
 applicant has made a generic invention that achieves the claimed result and do so by
 showing that the applicant has invented species sufficient to support a claim to the
 functionally-defined genus." *Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Eli & Lilly
 Co.,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1349, 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 2010)
 *(en banc)*.
 


Thus, the means- (or step-) plus- function claim must
 still be analyzed to determine whether there exists corresponding adequate support for
 such claim limitation under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. In considering whether there is
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph support for the claim limitation, the examiner must consider whether the
 specification describes the claimed invention in sufficient detail to establish that the
 inventor or joint inventor(s) had possession of the claimed invention as of the
 application's filing date. Additionally, any analysis of whether a particular claim is
 supported by the disclosure in an application requires a determination of whether that
 disclosure, when filed, contained sufficient information regarding the subject matter of
 the claim as to enable one skilled in the pertinent art to make and use the claimed
 invention. This enablement requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** is separate and
 distinct from the written description requirement. *Ariad,* 598 F.3d at
 1341. The enablement requirement serves a different purpose than the written description
 requirement in that it ensures that the invention is communicated to the interested
 public in a meaningful way. See **[MPEP § 2164](s2164.html#d0e215224)**. In considering whether
 there is 35 U.S.C. 112 para. 1 support for the claim limitation, the examiner must
 consider not only the original disclosure contained in the summary and detailed
 description of the invention portions of the specification, but also the original
 claims, abstract, and drawings. See *In re Mott,* 539 F.2d 1291, 1299,
 190 USPQ 536, 542–43 (CCPA 1976) (claims); *In re Anderson,* 471 F.2d
 1237, 1240, 176 USPQ 331, 333 (CCPA 1973) (claims); *Hill-Rom Co. v. Kinetic
 Concepts, Inc.,* 209 F.3d 1337, 54 USPQ2d 1437 (Fed. Cir. 2000)
 (unpublished) (abstract); *In re Armbruster,* 512 F.2d 676, 678–79, 185
 USPQ 152, 153–54 (CCPA 1975) (abstract); *Anderson,* 471 F.2d at 1240,
 176 USPQ at 333 (abstract); *Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555,
 1564, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (drawings); *In re Wolfensperger,* 302 F.2d
 950, 955–57, 133 USPQ 537, 541– 43 (CCPA 1962) (drawings).
 


Merely restating a function associated with a
 means-plus-function limitation is insufficient to provide the corresponding structure
 for definiteness. See, e.g., *Noah,* 675 F.3d at 1317, 102 USPQ2d at
 1419; *Blackboard,* 574 F.3d at 1384; *Aristocrat,*
 521 F.3d at 1334, 86 USPQ2d at 1239. It follows therefore that such a mere restatement
 of function in the specification without more description of the means that accomplish
 the function would also likely fail to provide adequate written description under
 **[section
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph.
 


**[37 CFR
 1.75(d)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320269)** provides, in part, that "the terms and phrases used in
 the claims must find clear support or antecedent basis in the description so that the
 meaning of the terms in the claims may be ascertainable by reference to the
 description." In the situation in which the written description only implicitly or
 inherently sets forth the structure, materials, or acts corresponding to a means- (or
 step-) plus-function, and the examiner concludes that one skilled in the art would
 recognize what structure, materials, or acts perform the function recited in a means-
 (or step-) plus-function, the examiner should either: (A) have the applicant clarify the
 record by amending the written description such that it expressly recites what
 structure, materials, or acts perform the function recited in the claim element; or (B)
 state on the record what structure, materials, or acts perform the function recited in
 the means- (or step-) plus-function limitation. Even if the disclosure implicitly sets
 forth the structure, materials, or acts corresponding to a means- (or step-)
 plus-function claim element in compliance with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first and second paragraphs, the USPTO may still require the
 applicant to amend the specification pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.75(d)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320269)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 608.01(o)](s608.html#d0e42440)** to explicitly state, with reference to the terms
 and phrases of the claim element, what structure, materials, or acts perform the
 function recited in the claim element in a manner that does not add prohibited new
 matter to the specification. See **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph ("An element in a claim for a combination may
 be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital
 of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to
 cover the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the

 specification or prosecution history clearly links or associates that structure to the

**V.** **SINGLE MEANS CLAIMS** A single means claim is a claim that recites a means-plus-function
 limitation as the only limitation of a claim. **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, by its terms is limited to "an element in a claim for a combination."
 Therefore, single means claims that do not recite a combination cannot invoke
 **[section
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. As such, they are not limited to the structure, material or act disclosed in
 the specification that performs the claimed function. Thus, a single means limitation
 that is properly construed will cover all means of performing the claimed function. The
 long-recognized problem with a single means claim is that it covers every conceivable
 means for achieving the stated result, while the specification discloses at most only
 those means known to the inventor. *In re Hyatt,* 708 F.2d 712, 218
 USPQ 195 (Fed. Cir. 1983). A claim of such breadth reads on subject matter that is not
 enabled by the specification, and therefore, should be rejected under **[section
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. See also **[MPEP
 § 2164.08(a)](s2164.html#d0e216700)**.
 


It is important to distinguish between claims that recite
 multiple functional limitations (a common practice particularly in the computer-related
 arts) and claims that recite a single element in means-plus-function terms (rare in most
 arts). In computer-implemented inventions, a microprocessor may be programmed with
 different algorithms, with each algorithm performing a separate function. Each of these
 separately programmed functions should be interpreted as a separate element.
 


Applicants frequently draft claims to computer-related
 inventions using a shorthand drafting technique that recites a generic placeholder, such
 as a "system", that performs a series of functions. This shorthand drafting technique
 does not avoid invoking **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA section
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph. See **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection II.B. Each
 function recited in this manner should be interpreted as a separate **[section
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph
 limitation.
 


For example, consider the following claim:



9. An image processing assembly that filters pixel
 values, comprising:
 


* a system configured to:
* extract a first pixel value; and
* compare the first pixel value to a pixel
 threshold to filter pixel values that exceed the threshold value.


Assume the specification that supports this claim
 discloses that the system is a microprocessor programmed with two separate
 algorithms, one for performing the extraction and another for comparing the pixel
 values. A proper interpretation would treat these elements as separate limitations
 each of which invoke treatment under **[section 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA section
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph since the word "system" has no structural
 meaning and in this case is serving as a generic placeholder for "means". 
 


The claim elements under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph would be interpreted as:
 


* system configured to extract a first pixel
 value; and
* system configured to compare the first pixel
 value to a pixel threshold to filter pixel values that exceed the threshold
 value.



This claim would not be considered a "single means"
 claim.
 


Compare this type of claim to the claim in
 *Hyatt* that was found to recite only a single element, which is
 drafted in "means-plus-function" format but fails to be in a combination. 
 



35. A Fourier transform processor for generating Fourier
 transformed incremental output signals in response to incremental input signals, said
 Fourier transform processor comprising incremental means for incrementally generating
 the Fourier transformed incremental output signals in response to the incremental input
 signals.
 



In re Hyatt, 708 F.2d 712, 714-715, 218 USPQ 195, 197 (Fed.
 Cir. 1983) (A single means claim which covered every conceivable means for achieving the
 stated purpose was held nonenabling for the scope of the claim because the specification
 disclosed at most only those means known to the inventor.)
 

**VI.** **ENSURE THAT THE RECORD IS CLEAR**When an examiner interprets a claim limitation under the
 provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph, the Office action should specify that the examiner has done so. A claim
 limitation is presumed to invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** when it explicitly
 uses the term "means" and includes functional language without corresponding structure
 recited in the claim. When the examiner has determined that **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applies, the examiner should also specify what the
 specification identifies as the corresponding structure. If the corresponding structure
 for the claimed function is not clearly identifiable in the specification, the Office
 action should, nevertheless, attempt to identify what structure is most closely
 associated with the means- (or step-) plus-function limitation to facilitate a prior art
 search. This is especially true when there may be confusion as to which disclosed
 implementation of the invention supports the limitation, as explained in subsection
 II.B., above. By contrast, a claim limitation that does not use the term "means" will
 trigger the presumption that **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** does not apply.
 


When **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** issues are raised
 the two rebuttable presumptions regarding the application of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** should be established in the prosecution record. Examiners
 should apply the applicable presumption and the 3-prong analysis to interpret a
 functional claim limitation in accordance with **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** including determining if the claim sets forth sufficient
 structure for performing the recited function. A determination that a claim is being
 interpreted according to **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** should be expressly
 stated in the Office action. By this, the applicant and the public are notified as to
 the claim construction used by the examiner during prosecution. Also, if the applicant
 intends a different claim construction, the issue can be clarified early in prosecution.
 In response to the Office action that determined **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** was invoked, if applicant does not want to have the claim
 limitation interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** applicant may: (1)
 present a sufficient showing to establish that the claim limitation recites sufficient
 structure to perform the claimed function so as to avoid interpretation under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**; or (2) amend the claim limitation in a way that avoids
 interpretation under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** (e.g., by reciting
 sufficient structure to perform the claimed function). 
 


 See **[MPEP § 2187](s2187.html#ch2100_d2c184_13b0a_4)** for applicable form
 paragraphs.
 


When allowing a claim that was treated under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** the examiner should indicate that the claim was interpreted
 under the provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** in reasons for
 allowance if such an explanation has not previously been made of record. As noted above,
 the indication should also clarify the associated structure if not readily apparent in
 the specification.
