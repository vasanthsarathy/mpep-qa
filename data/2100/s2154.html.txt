# 2154 Provisions Pertaining to Subject Matter in a U.S.
 Patent or Application Effectively Filed Before the Effective Filing Date of the Claimed
 Invention [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to applications
 subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA as
 set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is subject to
 examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP § 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for
 examination of applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** sets forth three types of U.S. patent documents that are
 available as prior art as of the date they were effectively filed with respect to the
 subject matter relied upon in the document if they name another inventor. See
 **[MPEP §§
 2151](s2151.html#ch2100_d2002f_22873_3d8)**,  **[2154.01](s2154.html#ch2100_d20033_27642_39b)**, and **[2154.01(a)](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_11f3b_a0)**

# 2154.01 Prior Art Under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) "U.S.
 Patent Documents" [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** sets forth three types of patent documents that
 are available as prior art as of the date they were effectively filed with respect to
 the subject matter relied upon in the document if they name another inventor: (1) U.S.
 patents; (2) U.S. patent application publications; and (3) certain WIPO published
 applications. These documents are referred to collectively as "U.S. patent documents."
 These documents may have different prior art effects under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** than under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Note that a
 U.S. patent document may also be prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if its issue or publication date is before the effective
 filing date of the claimed invention in question.
 


If the issue date of the U.S. patent or publication date
 of the U.S. patent application publication or WIPO published application is not before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention, it may be applicable as prior art
 under **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if it was "effectively filed" before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention in question with respect to the subject
 matter relied upon to reject the claim. **[MPEP §
 2152.01](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1afb3_e6)** discusses the "effective filing date" of a claimed
 invention. **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** sets forth the criteria to determine when
 subject matter described in a U.S. patent document was "effectively filed" for purposes
 of **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 



# 2154.01(a) WIPO Published Applications [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


The WIPO publication of a PCT international application
 that designates the United States is an application for patent deemed published under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)** for purposes of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** under **[35 U.S.C. 374](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307311313)**. Thus, under the
 AIA, WIPO publications of PCT applications that designate the United States are
 treated as U.S. patent application publications for prior art purposes, regardless of
 the international filing date, whether they are published in English, or whether the
 PCT international application enters the national stage in the United States.
 Accordingly, a U.S. patent, a U.S. patent application publication, or a WIPO
 published application that names another inventor and was effectively filed before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention, is prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. This differs from the treatment of a WIPO
 published application under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, where a
 WIPO published application is treated as a U.S. patent application publication only
 if the PCT application was filed on or after November 29, 2000, designated the United
 States, and is published under **[PCT Article 21(2)](mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e363634)** in the English
 language. See **[MPEP §
 2136.03](s2136.html#d0e205924)**, subsection II. 
 




# 2154.01(b) Determining When Subject Matter Was
 Effectively Filed Under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** provides that a U.S. patent, U.S. patent
 application publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") is
 prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** with
 respect to any subject matter described in the patent or published application as of
 either its actual filing date (**[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1ee)**), or the
 filing date of a prior application to which there is a priority or benefit claim
 (**[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(d)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_200)**). A U.S. patent document "is entitled to
 claim" priority to, or the benefit of, a prior-filed application if it fulfills the
 ministerial requirements of: (1) containing a priority or benefit claim to the
 prior-filed application; (2) being filed within the applicable filing period
 requirement (copending with or within twelve months of the earlier filing, as
 applicable); and (3) having a common inventor or being by the same applicant. See
 **[MPEP §
 211](s211.html#ch200_d1ff71_1bd25_18b)***et. seq.*


The AIA draws a distinction between actually being
 entitled to priority to, or the benefit of, a prior-filed application according to
 the definition of "effective filing date" of a claimed invention in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 100(i)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_3d4)**, and merely being entitled to claim priority to,
 or the benefit of, a prior-filed application according to the use of "effectively
 filed" in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)**. As a result of this distinction, the
 question of whether a patent or published application is actually entitled to
 priority or benefit with respect to any of its claims is not at issue in determining
 the date the patent or published application was "effectively filed" for prior art
 purposes. Thus, there is no need to evaluate whether any claim of a U.S. patent
 document is actually entitled to priority or benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**,
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, or
 **[386](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_27b56_2ab)** when applying such a document as prior art. See
 **[MPEP §
 2136.03](s2136.html#d0e205924)** for the reference date under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** of U.S. patents, U.S. application publications, and
 international application publications entitled to the benefit of the filing date of
 prior application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)**,
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, or **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**.
 


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** requires that a prior-filed application to which
 a priority or benefit claim is made must describe the subject matter from the U.S.
 patent document relied upon in a rejection. However, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** does not require that this description meet the
 enablement requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. As discussed
 previously with respect to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, the
 Office does not view the AIA as changing the extent to which a claimed invention must
 be described for a prior art document to anticipate the claimed invention under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.
 


The AIA also eliminates the so-called
 *Hilmer* doctrine. Under the Hilmer doctrine, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** limited the effective filing date for U.S. patents (and
 published applications) as prior art to their earliest U.S. filing date. *In
 re Hilmer,* 359 F.2d 859, 149 USPQ 480 (CCPA 1966). In contrast,
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** provides that if the U.S. patent document claims
 priority to one or more prior-filed foreign or international applications under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** or **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, the patent or published
 application was effectively filed on the filing date of the earliest such application
 that describes the subject matter. Therefore, if the subject matter relied upon is
 described in the application to which there is a priority or benefit claim, the U.S.
 patent document is effective as prior art as of the filing date of the earliest such
 application, regardless of where filed. When examining an application to which the
 AIA changes in **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** do not apply, Office personnel will continue to apply the
 *Hilmer* doctrine, and foreign priority dates may not be used in
 determining **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** prior art dates. Note that the international
 filing date of a published PCT application may be the **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** prior art date under pre-AIA law under certain
 circumstances. See **[MPEP § 2136](s2136.html#d0e205544)**.
 




# 2154.01(c) Requirement Of "Names Another
 Inventor" [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


To qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, the prior art U.S. patent, U.S. patent application
 publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") must "name[ ]
 another inventor." This means that if there is any difference in inventive entity
 between the prior art U.S. patent document and the application under examination or
 patent under reexamination, the U.S. patent document satisfies the "names another
 inventor" requirement of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Thus, in
 the case of joint inventors, only one joint inventor needs to be different for the
 inventive entities to be different. Even if there are one or more joint inventors in
 common in a U.S. patent document and the later-filed application under examination or
 patent under reexamination, the U.S. patent document qualifies as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** unless an exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** is applicable.
 




# 2154.01(d) Provisional Rejections Under 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2); Reference Is a Copending U.S. Patent Application [R-10.2019]


If an earlier filed, copending, and unpublished U.S. patent
 application discloses subject matter which would anticipate the claims in a later
 filed pending U.S. application which has a different inventive entity, the examiner
 should determine whether a provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** of the later filed application can be made. In
 addition, a provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** may be made,
 in the circumstances described below, if the earlier filed, pending application has
 been published as redacted (**[37 CFR 1.217](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e325410)**) and the subject
 matter relied upon in the rejection is not supported in the redacted publication of
 the patent application.
 

**I.** **COPENDING U.S. APPLICATIONS HAVING AT LEAST ONE COMMON INVENTOR OR COMMON
 APPLICANT OR ARE COMMONLY ASSIGNED**If (1) at least one common inventor or common applicant exists
 between the applications or the applications are commonly assigned and (2) the
 effective filing dates are different, then a provisional rejection of the later
 filed application should be made. The provisional rejection is appropriate in
 circumstances where if the earlier filed application is published or becomes a
 patent it would constitute actual prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Since the earlier-filed application is not published at
 the time of the rejection, the rejection must be provisionally made under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 


A provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** can be overcome in the same manner that a
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** rejection can be overcome. See
 **[MPEP § 2152.06](s2152.html#ch2100_d2c184_13ec5_303)**. The provisional rejection
 can also be overcome by abandoning the applications and
 filing a new application containing the subject matter of both.
 


Form paragraph **[7.15.01.aia](#fp7.15.01.aia)** should be used when making a
 provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 
 

**II.** **COPENDING APPLICATIONS HAVING NO COMMON INVENTOR, APPLICANT, OR
 ASSIGNEE**If there is no common assignee, common applicant, or common
 inventor and the application was not published pursuant to **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)**, the confidential status of applications under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 122(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)** must be maintained and no rejection can be made
 relying on the earlier filed, unpublished application, or subject matter not
 supported in a redacted application publication, as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. For applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**, if the filing dates of the applications are
 within 6 months of each other (3 months for simple subject matter) then
 interference may be proper. See **[MPEP Chapter 2300](mpep-2300.html#d0e237627)**. If the
 application with the earliest effective U.S. filing date will not be published
 pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)**, it must be allowed to issue once all the
 statutory requirements are met. After the patent is published, it may be used as a
 reference in a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** in the
 still pending application as appropriate. See **[MPEP §§
 2120.01](s2120.html#ch2100_d2c183_20d9a_21c)** and **[2154](s2154.html#ch2100_d20033_274f5_338)**.

 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See

**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1a7)** provides an exception to the prior art
 provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. This
 exception limits the use of an inventor's own work as prior art, when the inventor's
 own work is disclosed in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO
 published application ("U.S. patent document") by another who obtained the subject
 matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor.
 


Specifically, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1a7)** provides that a disclosure which would otherwise
 qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** may be
 excepted as prior art if the subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or
 indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor. Thus, if the subject matter in a
 U.S. patent document upon which the rejection is based is by another who obtained the
 subject matter from the inventor or a joint inventor, the applicant may establish by
 way of an affidavit or declaration that a disclosure is not prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. **[MPEP §

 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application

**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** provides additional exceptions to the prior
 art provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. These
 provisions except as prior art subject matter that was effectively filed by another
 after the subject matter had been publicly disclosed by the inventor, a joint
 inventor, or another who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the
 inventor or joint inventor.
 


Specifically, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** provides that a disclosure which would otherwise
 qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** (a U.S.
 patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S.
 patent document")) may be excepted as prior art if the subject matter disclosed had
 been previously publicly disclosed by the inventor, a joint inventor, or another who
 obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor. The previous public disclosure of the subject matter by the inventor, a
 joint inventor, or another who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly
 from the inventor or joint inventor must itself be a public disclosure (i.e., be
 either an inventor disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor or be an
 inventor-originated disclosure by another who obtained the subject matter directly or
 indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor). If a previous public disclosure by
 the inventor or which originated with the inventor is not within the grace period of
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**, it would qualify as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, and could not be excepted under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_172)**. **[MPEP §
 2155.02](s2155.html#ch2100_d20034_173e3_369)** discusses the use of affidavits or declarations to
 show that the subject matter disclosed had, before such disclosure, been publicly
 disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor, and **[MPEP §
 2155.03](s2155.html#ch2100_d20034_1891a_11)** discusses the use of affidavits or declarations to
 show that another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly
 from the inventor or a joint inventor.
 


Similar to the previous discussion of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)**, the exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** applies if the "subject matter disclosed [in the
 intervening disclosure] had, before such [intervening] disclosure was effectively
 filed under subsection (a)(2), been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor or another who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the
 inventor or joint inventor." The exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** focuses on the "subject matter" that had been
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor). There is
 no requirement under **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** that the
 mode of prior disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained
 the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor) be the
 same as the mode of disclosure of the intervening U.S. patent document(e.g.,
 patenting, publication, public use, sale activity). There is also no requirement that
 the prior disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor be a verbatim or ipsissimis
 verbis disclosure of the intervening U.S. patent document. What is required for
 subject matter in the intervening U.S. patent document to be excepted under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** is that the subject matter must have been
 previously publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who
 obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor).
 


The exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** applies only to the subject matter in the
 intervening U.S. patent document being relied upon for a rejection under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** that was also publicly disclosed by the
 inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the subject matter directly or
 indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor) before the date the subject matter
 relied upon was effectively filed. The subject matter of an intervening U.S. patent
 document that was not previously publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor (or by another who obtained the subject matter from the inventor or joint
 inventor) is available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. For example, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed elements A, B, and C, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent
 document discloses elements A, B, C, and D, then only element D of the intervening
 U.S. patent document is available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. In other words, the exceptions in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** do not necessarily remove the entire disclosure in
 the intervening reference from being prior art.
 


In addition, if subject matter of an intervening U.S.
 patent document is simply a more general description of the subject matter previously
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor), the
 exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)**
 applies to such subject matter of the intervening U.S. patent document. For example,
 if the inventor or a joint inventor had publicly disclosed a species, and a
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document discloses a genus (i.e., provides a more
 generic disclosure of the species), the disclosure of the genus in the intervening
 U.S. patent document is not available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Conversely, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed a genus, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent document
 discloses a species, the disclosure of the species in the subsequent intervening U.S.
 patent document would be available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Likewise, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed a species, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent document
 discloses an alternative species not also disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor, the disclosure of the alternative species in the intervening U.S. patent
 document would be available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 


Finally, **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** does
 not discuss "the claimed invention" with respect to either the subject matter
 disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor, or the subject matter of the
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document. Any inquiry with respect to the claimed
 invention is whether or not the subject matter in the prior art disclosure being
 relied upon anticipates or renders obvious the claimed invention. A determination of
 whether the exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** is
 applicable to subject matter in an intervening U.S. patent document does not involve
 a comparison of the subject matter of the claimed invention to either the subject
 matter disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor, or to the subject matter of the
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document.

**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** provides an additional exception to the
 prior art provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. The
 exception of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)**
 excepts subject matter disclosed in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application
 publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") from constituting
 prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the
 subject matter disclosed and the claimed invention, not later than the effective
 filing date of the claimed invention, "were owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person." **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** resembles **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** in that
 both concern common ownership, and offer an avenue by which an applicant may avoid
 certain prior art. However, there are significant differences between
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**.
 


If the provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** are met, a U.S. patent document that might
 otherwise qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** is not
 available as prior art under either **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**. This differs from **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** in which
 prior art can preclude patentability under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, even if
 the conditions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** are met. The consequence of this
 distinction is that a published application or an issued patent that falls under the
 common ownership exception of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** may
 not be applied in either an anticipation or an obviousness rejection.
 


It is important to note the circumstances in which the
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception does not remove a U.S. patent
 document as a basis for a rejection. The **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception does not apply to a disclosure that
 qualifies as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**
 (disclosures made before the effective filing date of the claimed invention). Thus,
 if the publication date or issue date of a U.S. patent document is before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention, it may be prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, regardless of common ownership or the
 existence of an obligation to assign. Also, even if a U.S. patent or U.S. published
 application is not prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** as a result of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)**, a double patenting rejection (either statutory
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** or non-statutory, sometimes called obviousness-type) may
 still be made on the basis of the U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication.
 Furthermore, the U.S. patent document that does not qualify as prior art as a result
 of **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** may still be cited, in appropriate
 situations, to indicate the state of the art when making a lack of enablement
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. A document need
 not qualify as prior art to be applied in the context of double patenting, see
 **[MPEP §
 804.03](s804.html#d0e101750)** (prior art disqualified under the CREATE Act may be
 the basis for a double patenting rejection), or enablement. See **[MPEP § 2124](s2124.html#d0e202094)**.
 


The Office revised the rules of practice to include
 provisions that pertain to commonly owned or joint research agreement subject matter
 (**[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(4)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322181)** and **[(c)(5)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322227)**). **[37 CFR

 matter under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** is treated under **[37 CFR 1.104(c)(4)(i)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322191)**, and
 commonly owned subject matter under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is treated under **[37 CFR 1.104(c)(5)(i)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322231)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2146.01](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_126fa_f3)**.
 


A clear and conspicuous statement by the applicant (or
 the applicant's representative of record) that the claimed invention of the
 application under examination and the subject matter disclosed in the U.S. patent
 document applied as prior art were owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person not later than the effective filing date
 of the claimed invention will be sufficient to establish that the **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception applies. Likewise, when relying on the
 provisions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**, the applicant (or the applicant's
 representative of record) can provide a similar statement required to disqualify the
 cited prior art. The applicant may present supporting evidence such as copies of
 assignment documents, but is not required to do so. Furthermore, the Office will not
 request corroborating evidence in the absence of independent evidence which raises
 doubt as to the veracity of such a statement. The statement under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** will generally be treated by Office personnel
 analogously to statements made under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**. See
 **[MPEP §

# 2154.01 Prior Art Under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) "U.S.
 Patent Documents" [R-11.2013]


 *[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** sets forth three types of patent documents that
 are available as prior art as of the date they were effectively filed with respect to
 the subject matter relied upon in the document if they name another inventor: (1) U.S.
 patents; (2) U.S. patent application publications; and (3) certain WIPO published
 applications. These documents are referred to collectively as "U.S. patent documents."
 These documents may have different prior art effects under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** than under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Note that a
 U.S. patent document may also be prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** if its issue or publication date is before the effective
 filing date of the claimed invention in question.
 


If the issue date of the U.S. patent or publication date
 of the U.S. patent application publication or WIPO published application is not before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention, it may be applicable as prior art
 under **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if it was "effectively filed" before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention in question with respect to the subject
 matter relied upon to reject the claim. **[MPEP §
 2152.01](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1afb3_e6)** discusses the "effective filing date" of a claimed
 invention. **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** sets forth the criteria to determine when
 subject matter described in a U.S. patent document was "effectively filed" for purposes
 of **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 



# 2154.01(a) WIPO Published Applications [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


The WIPO publication of a PCT international application
 that designates the United States is an application for patent deemed published under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)** for purposes of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** under **[35 U.S.C. 374](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307311313)**. Thus, under the
 AIA, WIPO publications of PCT applications that designate the United States are
 treated as U.S. patent application publications for prior art purposes, regardless of
 the international filing date, whether they are published in English, or whether the
 PCT international application enters the national stage in the United States.
 Accordingly, a U.S. patent, a U.S. patent application publication, or a WIPO
 published application that names another inventor and was effectively filed before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention, is prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. This differs from the treatment of a WIPO
 published application under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, where a
 WIPO published application is treated as a U.S. patent application publication only
 if the PCT application was filed on or after November 29, 2000, designated the United
 States, and is published under **[PCT Article 21(2)](mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e363634)** in the English
 language. See **[MPEP §
 2136.03](s2136.html#d0e205924)**, subsection II. 
 




# 2154.01(b) Determining When Subject Matter Was
 Effectively Filed Under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** provides that a U.S. patent, U.S. patent
 application publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") is
 prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** with
 respect to any subject matter described in the patent or published application as of
 either its actual filing date (**[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1ee)**), or the
 filing date of a prior application to which there is a priority or benefit claim
 (**[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(d)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_200)**). A U.S. patent document "is entitled to
 claim" priority to, or the benefit of, a prior-filed application if it fulfills the
 ministerial requirements of: (1) containing a priority or benefit claim to the
 prior-filed application; (2) being filed within the applicable filing period
 requirement (copending with or within twelve months of the earlier filing, as
 applicable); and (3) having a common inventor or being by the same applicant. See
 **[MPEP §
 211](s211.html#ch200_d1ff71_1bd25_18b)***et. seq.*


The AIA draws a distinction between actually being
 entitled to priority to, or the benefit of, a prior-filed application according to
 the definition of "effective filing date" of a claimed invention in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 100(i)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_3d4)**, and merely being entitled to claim priority to,
 or the benefit of, a prior-filed application according to the use of "effectively
 filed" in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)**. As a result of this distinction, the
 question of whether a patent or published application is actually entitled to
 priority or benefit with respect to any of its claims is not at issue in determining
 the date the patent or published application was "effectively filed" for prior art
 purposes. Thus, there is no need to evaluate whether any claim of a U.S. patent
 document is actually entitled to priority or benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**,
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, or
 **[386](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_27b56_2ab)** when applying such a document as prior art. See
 **[MPEP §
 2136.03](s2136.html#d0e205924)** for the reference date under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** of U.S. patents, U.S. application publications, and
 international application publications entitled to the benefit of the filing date of
 prior application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)**,
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, or **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**.
 


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** requires that a prior-filed application to which
 a priority or benefit claim is made must describe the subject matter from the U.S.
 patent document relied upon in a rejection. However, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** does not require that this description meet the
 enablement requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. As discussed
 previously with respect to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, the
 Office does not view the AIA as changing the extent to which a claimed invention must
 be described for a prior art document to anticipate the claimed invention under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.
 


The AIA also eliminates the so-called
 *Hilmer* doctrine. Under the Hilmer doctrine, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** limited the effective filing date for U.S. patents (and
 published applications) as prior art to their earliest U.S. filing date. *In
 re Hilmer,* 359 F.2d 859, 149 USPQ 480 (CCPA 1966). In contrast,
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** provides that if the U.S. patent document claims
 priority to one or more prior-filed foreign or international applications under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** or **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, the patent or published
 application was effectively filed on the filing date of the earliest such application
 that describes the subject matter. Therefore, if the subject matter relied upon is
 described in the application to which there is a priority or benefit claim, the U.S.
 patent document is effective as prior art as of the filing date of the earliest such
 application, regardless of where filed. When examining an application to which the
 AIA changes in **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** do not apply, Office personnel will continue to apply the
 *Hilmer* doctrine, and foreign priority dates may not be used in
 determining **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** prior art dates. Note that the international
 filing date of a published PCT application may be the **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** prior art date under pre-AIA law under certain
 circumstances. See **[MPEP § 2136](s2136.html#d0e205544)**.
 




# 2154.01(c) Requirement Of "Names Another
 Inventor" [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


To qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, the prior art U.S. patent, U.S. patent application
 publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") must "name[ ]
 another inventor." This means that if there is any difference in inventive entity
 between the prior art U.S. patent document and the application under examination or
 patent under reexamination, the U.S. patent document satisfies the "names another
 inventor" requirement of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Thus, in
 the case of joint inventors, only one joint inventor needs to be different for the
 inventive entities to be different. Even if there are one or more joint inventors in
 common in a U.S. patent document and the later-filed application under examination or
 patent under reexamination, the U.S. patent document qualifies as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** unless an exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** is applicable.
 




# 2154.01(d) Provisional Rejections Under 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2); Reference Is a Copending U.S. Patent Application [R-10.2019]


If an earlier filed, copending, and unpublished U.S. patent
 application discloses subject matter which would anticipate the claims in a later
 filed pending U.S. application which has a different inventive entity, the examiner
 should determine whether a provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** of the later filed application can be made. In
 addition, a provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** may be made,
 in the circumstances described below, if the earlier filed, pending application has
 been published as redacted (**[37 CFR 1.217](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e325410)**) and the subject
 matter relied upon in the rejection is not supported in the redacted publication of
 the patent application.
 

**I.** **COPENDING U.S. APPLICATIONS HAVING AT LEAST ONE COMMON INVENTOR OR COMMON
 APPLICANT OR ARE COMMONLY ASSIGNED**If (1) at least one common inventor or common applicant exists
 between the applications or the applications are commonly assigned and (2) the
 effective filing dates are different, then a provisional rejection of the later
 filed application should be made. The provisional rejection is appropriate in
 circumstances where if the earlier filed application is published or becomes a
 patent it would constitute actual prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Since the earlier-filed application is not published at
 the time of the rejection, the rejection must be provisionally made under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 


A provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** can be overcome in the same manner that a
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** rejection can be overcome. See
 **[MPEP § 2152.06](s2152.html#ch2100_d2c184_13ec5_303)**. The provisional rejection
 can also be overcome by abandoning the applications and
 filing a new application containing the subject matter of both.
 


Form paragraph **[7.15.01.aia](#fp7.15.01.aia)** should be used when making a
 provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 
 

**II.** **COPENDING APPLICATIONS HAVING NO COMMON INVENTOR, APPLICANT, OR
 ASSIGNEE**If there is no common assignee, common applicant, or common
 inventor and the application was not published pursuant to **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)**, the confidential status of applications under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 122(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)** must be maintained and no rejection can be made
 relying on the earlier filed, unpublished application, or subject matter not
 supported in a redacted application publication, as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. For applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**, if the filing dates of the applications are
 within 6 months of each other (3 months for simple subject matter) then
 interference may be proper. See **[MPEP Chapter 2300](mpep-2300.html#d0e237627)**. If the
 application with the earliest effective U.S. filing date will not be published
 pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)**, it must be allowed to issue once all the
 statutory requirements are met. After the patent is published, it may be used as a
 reference in a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** in the
 still pending application as appropriate. See **[MPEP §§
 2120.01](s2120.html#ch2100_d2c183_20d9a_21c)** and **[2154](s2154.html#ch2100_d20033_274f5_338)**.

# 2154.01(a) WIPO Published Applications [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


The WIPO publication of a PCT international application
 that designates the United States is an application for patent deemed published under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)** for purposes of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** under **[35 U.S.C. 374](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307311313)**. Thus, under the
 AIA, WIPO publications of PCT applications that designate the United States are
 treated as U.S. patent application publications for prior art purposes, regardless of
 the international filing date, whether they are published in English, or whether the
 PCT international application enters the national stage in the United States.
 Accordingly, a U.S. patent, a U.S. patent application publication, or a WIPO
 published application that names another inventor and was effectively filed before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention, is prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. This differs from the treatment of a WIPO
 published application under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, where a
 WIPO published application is treated as a U.S. patent application publication only
 if the PCT application was filed on or after November 29, 2000, designated the United

# 2154.01(b) Determining When Subject Matter Was
 Effectively Filed Under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** provides that a U.S. patent, U.S. patent
 application publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") is
 prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** with
 respect to any subject matter described in the patent or published application as of
 either its actual filing date (**[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1ee)**), or the
 filing date of a prior application to which there is a priority or benefit claim
 (**[AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(d)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_200)**). A U.S. patent document "is entitled to
 claim" priority to, or the benefit of, a prior-filed application if it fulfills the
 ministerial requirements of: (1) containing a priority or benefit claim to the
 prior-filed application; (2) being filed within the applicable filing period
 requirement (copending with or within twelve months of the earlier filing, as
 applicable); and (3) having a common inventor or being by the same applicant. See
 **[MPEP §
 211](s211.html#ch200_d1ff71_1bd25_18b)***et. seq.*


The AIA draws a distinction between actually being
 entitled to priority to, or the benefit of, a prior-filed application according to
 the definition of "effective filing date" of a claimed invention in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 100(i)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e1a_3d4)**, and merely being entitled to claim priority to,
 or the benefit of, a prior-filed application according to the use of "effectively
 filed" in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)**. As a result of this distinction, the
 question of whether a patent or published application is actually entitled to
 priority or benefit with respect to any of its claims is not at issue in determining
 the date the patent or published application was "effectively filed" for prior art
 purposes. Thus, there is no need to evaluate whether any claim of a U.S. patent
 document is actually entitled to priority or benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**,
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, or
 **[386](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_27b56_2ab)** when applying such a document as prior art. See
 **[MPEP §
 2136.03](s2136.html#d0e205924)** for the reference date under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** of U.S. patents, U.S. application publications, and
 international application publications entitled to the benefit of the filing date of
 prior application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)**,
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, or **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**.
 


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** requires that a prior-filed application to which
 a priority or benefit claim is made must describe the subject matter from the U.S.
 patent document relied upon in a rejection. However, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** does not require that this description meet the
 enablement requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. As discussed
 previously with respect to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, the
 Office does not view the AIA as changing the extent to which a claimed invention must
 be described for a prior art document to anticipate the claimed invention under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.
 


The AIA also eliminates the so-called
 *Hilmer* doctrine. Under the Hilmer doctrine, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** limited the effective filing date for U.S. patents (and
 published applications) as prior art to their earliest U.S. filing date. *In
 re Hilmer,* 359 F.2d 859, 149 USPQ 480 (CCPA 1966). In contrast,
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(d)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** provides that if the U.S. patent document claims
 priority to one or more prior-filed foreign or international applications under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** or **[365](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307034)**, the patent or published
 application was effectively filed on the filing date of the earliest such application
 that describes the subject matter. Therefore, if the subject matter relied upon is
 described in the application to which there is a priority or benefit claim, the U.S.
 patent document is effective as prior art as of the filing date of the earliest such
 application, regardless of where filed. When examining an application to which the
 AIA changes in **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** do not apply, Office personnel will continue to apply the
 *Hilmer* doctrine, and foreign priority dates may not be used in
 determining **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** prior art dates. Note that the international
 filing date of a published PCT application may be the **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** prior art date under pre-AIA law under certain
 circumstances. See **[MPEP § 2136](s2136.html#d0e205544)**.

# 2154.01(c) Requirement Of "Names Another
 Inventor" [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


To qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, the prior art U.S. patent, U.S. patent application
 publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") must "name[ ]
 another inventor." This means that if there is any difference in inventive entity
 between the prior art U.S. patent document and the application under examination or
 patent under reexamination, the U.S. patent document satisfies the "names another
 inventor" requirement of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Thus, in
 the case of joint inventors, only one joint inventor needs to be different for the
 inventive entities to be different. Even if there are one or more joint inventors in
 common in a U.S. patent document and the later-filed application under examination or
 patent under reexamination, the U.S. patent document qualifies as prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** unless an exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_19a)** is applicable.

# 2154.01(d) Provisional Rejections Under 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2); Reference Is a Copending U.S. Patent Application [R-10.2019]


If an earlier filed, copending, and unpublished U.S. patent
 application discloses subject matter which would anticipate the claims in a later
 filed pending U.S. application which has a different inventive entity, the examiner
 should determine whether a provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** of the later filed application can be made. In
 addition, a provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** may be made,
 in the circumstances described below, if the earlier filed, pending application has
 been published as redacted (**[37 CFR 1.217](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e325410)**) and the subject
 matter relied upon in the rejection is not supported in the redacted publication of
 the patent application.
 

**I.** **COPENDING U.S. APPLICATIONS HAVING AT LEAST ONE COMMON INVENTOR OR COMMON
 APPLICANT OR ARE COMMONLY ASSIGNED**If (1) at least one common inventor or common applicant exists
 between the applications or the applications are commonly assigned and (2) the
 effective filing dates are different, then a provisional rejection of the later
 filed application should be made. The provisional rejection is appropriate in
 circumstances where if the earlier filed application is published or becomes a
 patent it would constitute actual prior art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Since the earlier-filed application is not published at
 the time of the rejection, the rejection must be provisionally made under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 


A provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** can be overcome in the same manner that a
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** rejection can be overcome. See
 **[MPEP § 2152.06](s2152.html#ch2100_d2c184_13ec5_303)**. The provisional rejection
 can also be overcome by abandoning the applications and
 filing a new application containing the subject matter of both.
 


Form paragraph **[7.15.01.aia](#fp7.15.01.aia)** should be used when making a
 provisional rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 
 

**II.** **COPENDING APPLICATIONS HAVING NO COMMON INVENTOR, APPLICANT, OR
 ASSIGNEE**If there is no common assignee, common applicant, or common
 inventor and the application was not published pursuant to **[35 U.S.C.
 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)**, the confidential status of applications under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 122(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)** must be maintained and no rejection can be made
 relying on the earlier filed, unpublished application, or subject matter not
 supported in a redacted application publication, as prior art under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. For applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**, if the filing dates of the applications are
 within 6 months of each other (3 months for simple subject matter) then
 interference may be proper. See **[MPEP Chapter 2300](mpep-2300.html#d0e237627)**. If the
 application with the earliest effective U.S. filing date will not be published
 pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)**, it must be allowed to issue once all the
 statutory requirements are met. After the patent is published, it may be used as a
 reference in a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** in the
 still pending application as appropriate. See **[MPEP §§
 2120.01](s2120.html#ch2100_d2c183_20d9a_21c)** and **[2154](s2154.html#ch2100_d20033_274f5_338)**.

 disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor, and **[MPEP §
 2155.03](s2155.html#ch2100_d20034_1891a_11)** discusses the use of affidavits or declarations to
 show that another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly
 from the inventor or a joint inventor.
 


Similar to the previous discussion of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(1)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)**, the exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** applies if the "subject matter disclosed [in the
 intervening disclosure] had, before such [intervening] disclosure was effectively
 filed under subsection (a)(2), been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor or another who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the
 inventor or joint inventor." The exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** focuses on the "subject matter" that had been
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor). There is
 no requirement under **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** that the
 mode of prior disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained
 the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor) be the
 same as the mode of disclosure of the intervening U.S. patent document(e.g.,
 patenting, publication, public use, sale activity). There is also no requirement that
 the prior disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor be a verbatim or ipsissimis
 verbis disclosure of the intervening U.S. patent document. What is required for
 subject matter in the intervening U.S. patent document to be excepted under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** is that the subject matter must have been
 previously publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who
 obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor).
 


The exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** applies only to the subject matter in the
 intervening U.S. patent document being relied upon for a rejection under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** that was also publicly disclosed by the
 inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the subject matter directly or
 indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor) before the date the subject matter
 relied upon was effectively filed. The subject matter of an intervening U.S. patent
 document that was not previously publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor (or by another who obtained the subject matter from the inventor or joint
 inventor) is available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. For example, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed elements A, B, and C, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent
 document discloses elements A, B, C, and D, then only element D of the intervening
 U.S. patent document is available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. In other words, the exceptions in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** do not necessarily remove the entire disclosure in
 the intervening reference from being prior art.
 


In addition, if subject matter of an intervening U.S.
 patent document is simply a more general description of the subject matter previously
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor), the
 exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)**
 applies to such subject matter of the intervening U.S. patent document. For example,
 if the inventor or a joint inventor had publicly disclosed a species, and a
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document discloses a genus (i.e., provides a more
 generic disclosure of the species), the disclosure of the genus in the intervening
 U.S. patent document is not available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Conversely, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed a genus, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent document
 discloses a species, the disclosure of the species in the subsequent intervening U.S.
 patent document would be available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Likewise, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed a species, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent document
 discloses an alternative species not also disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor, the disclosure of the alternative species in the intervening U.S. patent
 document would be available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 


Finally, **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** does
 not discuss "the claimed invention" with respect to either the subject matter
 disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor, or the subject matter of the
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document. Any inquiry with respect to the claimed
 invention is whether or not the subject matter in the prior art disclosure being
 relied upon anticipates or renders obvious the claimed invention. A determination of
 whether the exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** is
 applicable to subject matter in an intervening U.S. patent document does not involve
 a comparison of the subject matter of the claimed invention to either the subject
 matter disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor, or to the subject matter of the
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document.
 




# 2154.02(c) Prior Art Exception Under AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C) to AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) (Common Ownership or Obligation of
 Assignment) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** provides an additional exception to the
 prior art provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. The
 exception of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)**
 excepts subject matter disclosed in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application
 publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") from constituting
 prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the
 subject matter disclosed and the claimed invention, not later than the effective
 filing date of the claimed invention, "were owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person." **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** resembles **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** in that
 both concern common ownership, and offer an avenue by which an applicant may avoid
 certain prior art. However, there are significant differences between
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**.
 


If the provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** are met, a U.S. patent document that might
 otherwise qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** is not
 available as prior art under either **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**. This differs from **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** in which
 prior art can preclude patentability under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, even if
 the conditions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** are met. The consequence of this
 distinction is that a published application or an issued patent that falls under the
 common ownership exception of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** may
 not be applied in either an anticipation or an obviousness rejection.
 


It is important to note the circumstances in which the
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception does not remove a U.S. patent
 document as a basis for a rejection. The **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception does not apply to a disclosure that
 qualifies as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**
 (disclosures made before the effective filing date of the claimed invention). Thus,
 if the publication date or issue date of a U.S. patent document is before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention, it may be prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, regardless of common ownership or the
 existence of an obligation to assign. Also, even if a U.S. patent or U.S. published
 application is not prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** as a result of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)**, a double patenting rejection (either statutory
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** or non-statutory, sometimes called obviousness-type) may
 still be made on the basis of the U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication.
 Furthermore, the U.S. patent document that does not qualify as prior art as a result
 of **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** may still be cited, in appropriate
 situations, to indicate the state of the art when making a lack of enablement
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. A document need
 not qualify as prior art to be applied in the context of double patenting, see
 **[MPEP §
 804.03](s804.html#d0e101750)** (prior art disqualified under the CREATE Act may be
 the basis for a double patenting rejection), or enablement. See **[MPEP § 2124](s2124.html#d0e202094)**.
 


The Office revised the rules of practice to include
 provisions that pertain to commonly owned or joint research agreement subject matter
 (**[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(4)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322181)** and **[(c)(5)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322227)**). **[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(4)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322181)** applies to an application that is subject to
 **[AIA 35

 **[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(5)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322227)** applies to an application that is subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. Commonly owned subject
 matter under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** is treated under **[37 CFR 1.104(c)(4)(i)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322191)**, and
 commonly owned subject matter under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is treated under **[37 CFR 1.104(c)(5)(i)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322231)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2146.01](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_126fa_f3)**.
 


A clear and conspicuous statement by the applicant (or
 the applicant's representative of record) that the claimed invention of the
 application under examination and the subject matter disclosed in the U.S. patent
 document applied as prior art were owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person not later than the effective filing date
 of the claimed invention will be sufficient to establish that the **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception applies. Likewise, when relying on the
 provisions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**, the applicant (or the applicant's
 representative of record) can provide a similar statement required to disqualify the
 cited prior art. The applicant may present supporting evidence such as copies of
 assignment documents, but is not required to do so. Furthermore, the Office will not
 request corroborating evidence in the absence of independent evidence which raises
 doubt as to the veracity of such a statement. The statement under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** will generally be treated by Office personnel
 analogously to statements made under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2146.02](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_12765_27)**, subsection II.

**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(A)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1a7)** provides an exception to the prior art
 provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. This
 exception limits the use of an inventor's own work as prior art, when the inventor's
 own work is disclosed in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO
 published application ("U.S. patent document") by another who obtained the subject

 excepted as prior art if the subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or
 indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor. Thus, if the subject matter in a
 U.S. patent document upon which the rejection is based is by another who obtained the

Specifically, **[AIA 35 U.S.C.

 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** applies if the "subject matter disclosed [in the
 intervening disclosure] had, before such [intervening] disclosure was effectively
 filed under subsection (a)(2), been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor or another who obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the
 inventor or joint inventor." The exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** focuses on the "subject matter" that had been
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor). There is
 no requirement under **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** that the
 mode of prior disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained
 the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor) be the
 same as the mode of disclosure of the intervening U.S. patent document(e.g.,
 patenting, publication, public use, sale activity). There is also no requirement that
 the prior disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor be a verbatim or ipsissimis
 verbis disclosure of the intervening U.S. patent document. What is required for
 subject matter in the intervening U.S. patent document to be excepted under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** is that the subject matter must have been
 previously publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who
 obtained the subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint
 inventor).
 


The exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** applies only to the subject matter in the
 intervening U.S. patent document being relied upon for a rejection under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** that was also publicly disclosed by the
 inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the subject matter directly or
 indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor) before the date the subject matter
 relied upon was effectively filed. The subject matter of an intervening U.S. patent
 document that was not previously publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor (or by another who obtained the subject matter from the inventor or joint
 inventor) is available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. For example, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed elements A, B, and C, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent
 document discloses elements A, B, C, and D, then only element D of the intervening
 U.S. patent document is available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. In other words, the exceptions in **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** do not necessarily remove the entire disclosure in
 the intervening reference from being prior art.
 


In addition, if subject matter of an intervening U.S.
 patent document is simply a more general description of the subject matter previously
 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor (or another who obtained the
 subject matter directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint inventor), the
 exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_18d)**
 applies to such subject matter of the intervening U.S. patent document. For example,
 if the inventor or a joint inventor had publicly disclosed a species, and a
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document discloses a genus (i.e., provides a more
 generic disclosure of the species), the disclosure of the genus in the intervening
 U.S. patent document is not available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Conversely, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed a genus, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent document
 discloses a species, the disclosure of the species in the subsequent intervening U.S.
 patent document would be available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. Likewise, if the inventor or a joint inventor had
 publicly disclosed a species, and a subsequent intervening U.S. patent document
 discloses an alternative species not also disclosed by the inventor or a joint
 inventor, the disclosure of the alternative species in the intervening U.S. patent
 document would be available as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**.
 


Finally, **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** does
 not discuss "the claimed invention" with respect to either the subject matter
 disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor, or the subject matter of the
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document. Any inquiry with respect to the claimed
 invention is whether or not the subject matter in the prior art disclosure being
 relied upon anticipates or renders obvious the claimed invention. A determination of
 whether the exception in **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1b3)** is
 applicable to subject matter in an intervening U.S. patent document does not involve
 a comparison of the subject matter of the claimed invention to either the subject
 matter disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor, or to the subject matter of the
 subsequent intervening U.S. patent document.

# 2154.02(c) Prior Art Exception Under AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C) to AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) (Common Ownership or Obligation of
 Assignment) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **only applicable** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application
 is subject to examination under the FITF provisions, and **[MPEP §
 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)**-**[MPEP § 2138](s2138.html#d0e207005)** for examination of
 applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.]*


**[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** provides an additional exception to the
 prior art provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**. The
 exception of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)**
 excepts subject matter disclosed in a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application
 publication, or WIPO published application ("U.S. patent document") from constituting
 prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** if the
 subject matter disclosed and the claimed invention, not later than the effective
 filing date of the claimed invention, "were owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person." **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** resembles **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** in that
 both concern common ownership, and offer an avenue by which an applicant may avoid
 certain prior art. However, there are significant differences between
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**.
 


If the provisions of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** are met, a U.S. patent document that might
 otherwise qualify as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)** is not
 available as prior art under either **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**. This differs from **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** in which
 prior art can preclude patentability under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, even if
 the conditions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** are met. The consequence of this
 distinction is that a published application or an issued patent that falls under the
 common ownership exception of **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** may
 not be applied in either an anticipation or an obviousness rejection.
 


It is important to note the circumstances in which the
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception does not remove a U.S. patent
 document as a basis for a rejection. The **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception does not apply to a disclosure that
 qualifies as prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**
 (disclosures made before the effective filing date of the claimed invention). Thus,
 if the publication date or issue date of a U.S. patent document is before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention, it may be prior art under
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, regardless of common ownership or the
 existence of an obligation to assign. Also, even if a U.S. patent or U.S. published
 application is not prior art under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** as a result of **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)**, a double patenting rejection (either statutory
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** or non-statutory, sometimes called obviousness-type) may
 still be made on the basis of the U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication.
 Furthermore, the U.S. patent document that does not qualify as prior art as a result
 of **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** may still be cited, in appropriate
 situations, to indicate the state of the art when making a lack of enablement
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. A document need
 not qualify as prior art to be applied in the context of double patenting, see
 **[MPEP §
 804.03](s804.html#d0e101750)** (prior art disqualified under the CREATE Act may be
 the basis for a double patenting rejection), or enablement. See **[MPEP § 2124](s2124.html#d0e202094)**.
 


The Office revised the rules of practice to include
 provisions that pertain to commonly owned or joint research agreement subject matter
 (**[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(4)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322181)** and **[(c)(5)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322227)**). **[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(4)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322181)** applies to an application that is subject to
 **[AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**, and
 **[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(5)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322227)** applies to an application that is subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. Commonly owned subject
 matter under **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** is treated under **[37 CFR 1.104(c)(4)(i)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322191)**, and
 commonly owned subject matter under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** is treated under **[37 CFR 1.104(c)(5)(i)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322231)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2146.01](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_126fa_f3)**.
 


A clear and conspicuous statement by the applicant (or
 the applicant's representative of record) that the claimed invention of the
 application under examination and the subject matter disclosed in the U.S. patent
 document applied as prior art were owned by the same person or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to the same person not later than the effective filing date
 of the claimed invention will be sufficient to establish that the **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** exception applies. Likewise, when relying on the
 provisions of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**, the applicant (or the applicant's
 representative of record) can provide a similar statement required to disqualify the
 cited prior art. The applicant may present supporting evidence such as copies of
 assignment documents, but is not required to do so. Furthermore, the Office will not
 request corroborating evidence in the absence of independent evidence which raises
 doubt as to the veracity of such a statement. The statement under **[AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)(2)(C)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)** will generally be treated by Office personnel
 analogously to statements made under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2146.02](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_12765_27)**, subsection II.
