# 2161 Three Separate Requirements for Specification Under 35 U.S.C.
 112(a) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph [R-07.2015]

**I.** **THE SPECIFICATION MUST INCLUDE A WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION,
 ENABLEMENT, AND BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE CLAIMED INVENTION*** 

35 U.S.C. 112(a) (applicable to applications
 filed on or after September 16, 2012) provides:
 
> 
> (a) IN GENERAL.—The specification shall contain a
>  written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and
>  using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person
>  skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly
>  connected, to make and use the same, and shall set forth the best mode
>  contemplated by the inventor or joint inventor of carrying out the invention. 
>  
> 
> 
> 


The first paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** (applicable to
 applications filed before September 16, 2012) provides:
 



> 
> The specification shall contain a written
>  description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making
>  and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to
>  enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains,
>  or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall set
>  forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying
>  out his invention. [emphasis added].

**[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph require that the specification include the following:
 


* (A) A written description of the invention;
* (B) The manner and process of making and using the invention (the
 enablement requirement); and
* (C) The best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his
 invention.

**II.** **THE THREE REQUIREMENTS ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER**The written description requirement is separate and distinct from the
 enablement requirement. *Ariad Pharm., Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co.,* 598
 F.3d 1336, 1341, 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2010) *(en banc)* (If
 Congress had intended enablement to be the sole description requirement of
 **[§
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, the statute would have been written
 differently.) *Vas-Cath, Inc.**v.**Mahurkar,* 935 F.2d 1555, 1562, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1115 (Fed. Cir. 1991)
 (While acknowledging that some of its cases concerning the written description
 requirement and the enablement requirement are confusing, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed
 that under **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, the written description requirement is
 separate and distinct from the enablement requirement and gave an example thereof.);
 *In re Barker,* 559 F.2d 588, 194 USPQ 470 (CCPA 1977), cert.
 denied, 434 U.S. 1064 (1978). See also, e.g., *Vasudevan Software, Inc. v.
 MicroStrategy, Inc.,* 782 F.3d 671, 681-685, 114 USPQ2d 1349, 1356, 1357
 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (reversing and remanding the district court's grant of summary judgment
 of invalidity for lack of an adequate written description and lack of enablement because
 there were genuine issues of material fact regarding 1) whether the claims had
 sufficient written description support ("[t]he fact that . . . the specification do[es]
 not speak in haec verba of accessing ‘disparate databases’ does not eliminate as a
 genuine issue of material fact that the existence of at least some discussion, and
 therefore, possession, of the accessing of disparate databases, as claimed"); and 2)
 whether the claims were enabled ("the effort it took the inventor to reduce the
 invention to practice does not conclusively show lack of enablement"). An invention may
 be described without the disclosure being enabling (e.g., a chemical compound for which
 there is no disclosed or apparent method of making), and a disclosure could be enabling
 without describing the invention (e.g., a specification describing a method of making
 and using a paint composition made of functionally defined ingredients within broad
 ranges would be enabling for formulations falling within the description but would not
 describe any specific formulation). See *In re**Armbruster,* 512 F.2d 676, 677, 185 USPQ 152, 153 (CCPA 1975) ("[A]
 specification which ‘describes’ does not necessarily also ‘enable’ one skilled in the
 art to make or use the claimed invention."). Best mode is a separate and distinct
 requirement from the enablement requirement. *In re**Newton,* 414 F.2d 1400, 163 USPQ 34 (CCPA 1969).
 



# 2161.01 Computer Programming, Computer Implemented Inventions, and 35
 U.S.C. 112(a) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph [R-10.2019]


The statutory requirements for computer-implemented
 inventions are the same as for all inventions, such as the subject matter eligibility
 and utility requirements under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** (see
 **[MPEP §§
 2106](s2106.html#d0e197244)** and **[2107](s2107.html#d0e198469)**, respectively), the novelty
 requirement of **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the nonobviousness requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the
 definiteness requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, and the three separate and distinct
 requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. In addition, claims with
 computer-implemented functional claim limitations may invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. See **[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection II.B, and **[§ 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection
 IV. for information regarding means- (or step-) plus- function limitations.
 


Even if a claim is not construed as a means-plus-
 function limitation under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**,
 computer-implemented functional claim language must still be evaluated for sufficient
 disclosure under the written description and enablement requirements of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**.
 

**I.** **DETERMINING WHETHER THERE IS ADEQUATE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION FOR A
 COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONAL CLAIM LIMITATION**The **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or first
 paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** contains a written description
 requirement that is separate and distinct from the enablement requirement.
 *Ariad Pharm., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co.,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1340,
 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2010) *(en banc)*. To satisfy the
 written description requirement, the specification must describe the claimed
 invention in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can reasonably conclude
 that the inventor had possession of the claimed invention at the time of filing.
 *Reiffin v. Microsoft Corp.,* 214 F.3d 1342, 1345 (Fed. Cir.
 2000) ("The purpose of [the written description requirement] is to ensure that the
 scope of the right to exclude, as set forth in the claims, does not overreach the
 scope of the inventor’s contribution to the field of art as described in the patent
 specification"); *LizardTech Inc. v. Earth Resource Mapping Inc.,*
 424 F.3d 1336, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("Whether the flaw in the specification is
 regarded as a failure to demonstrate that the applicant possessed the full scope of
 the invention recited in [the claim] or a failure to enable the full breadth of that
 claim, the specification provides inadequate support for the claim under
 [**[§
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**]"); cf. *id.* ("A claim will not be
 invalidated on **[[§] 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** grounds simply because
 the embodiments of the specification do not contain examples explicitly covering the
 full scope of the claim language."). While "[t]here is no special rule for supporting
 a genus by the disclosure of a species," the Federal Circuit has stated that
 "[w]hether the genus is supported vel non depends upon the state of the art and the
 nature and breadth of the genus." *Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus
 Inc.,* 645 F.3d 1336, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2011); *id.*
 (further explaining that "so long as disclosure of the species is sufficient to
 convey to one skilled in the art that the inventor possessed the subject matter of
 the genus, the genus will be supported by an adequate written description."). See
 also *Rivera v. Int'l Trade Comm’n,* 857 F.3d 1315, 1319-21 (Fed.
 Cir. 2017) (affirming the Commission’s findings that "the specification did not
 provide the necessary written description support for the full breadth of the
 asserted claims," where the claims were broadly drawn to a "container . . . adapted
 to hold brewing material" while the specification disclosed only a "pod adapter
 assembly" or "receptacle" designed to hold a "pod"). 
 


 Specifically, the specification must describe the
 claimed invention in a manner understandable to a person of ordinary skill in the art
 in a way that shows that the inventor actually invented the claimed invention at the
 time of filing. *Id.;**Ariad,* 598 F.3d at 1351, 94 USPQ2d at 1172. The function of the
 written description requirement is to ensure that the inventor had possession of the
 specific subject matter later claimed as of the filing date of the application relied
 on; how the specification accomplishes this is not material. *In re
 Herschler,* 591 F.2d 693, 700-01, 200 USPQ 711, 717 (CCPA 1979), further
 reiterated in *In re Kaslow,* 707 F.2d 1366, 217 USPQ 1089 (Fed.
 Cir. 1983); see also **[MPEP §§ 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** - **[2163.04](s2163.html#d0e214731)**. 
 


The written description requirement of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, applies to all claims including original claims that are part of the
 disclosure as filed. *Ariad,* 598 F.3d at 1349, 94 USPQ2d at 1170.
 As stated by the Federal Circuit, "[a]lthough many original claims will satisfy the
 written description requirement, certain claims may not." *Id.* at
 1349, 94 USPQ2d at 1170-71; see also *LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Res. Mapping,
 Inc.,* 424 F.3d 1336, 1343-46, 76 USPQ2d 1724, 1730-33 (Fed. Cir. 2005);
 *Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co.,* 119 F.3d
 1559, 1568, 43 USPQ2d 1398, 1405-06 (Fed. Cir. 1997)("The description requirement of
 the patent statute requires a description of an invention, not an indication of a
 result that one might achieve if one made that invention."). Problems satisfying the
 written description requirement for original claims often occur when claim language
 is generic or functional, or both. *Ariad,* 593 F.3d at 1349, 94
 USPQ2d at 1171 ("The problem is especially acute with genus claims that use
 functional language to define the boundaries of a claimed genus. In such a case, the
 functional claim may simply claim a desired result, and may do so without describing
 species that achieve that result. But the specification must demonstrate that the
 applicant has made a generic invention that achieves the claimed result and do so by
 showing that the applicant has invented species sufficient to support a claim to the
 functionally-defined genus.").
 


For instance, generic claim language in the original
 disclosure does not satisfy the written description requirement if it fails to
 support the scope of the genus claimed. *Ariad,* 598 F.3d at
 1349-50, 94 USPQ2d at 1171 ("[A]n adequate written description of a claimed genus
 requires more than a generic statement of an invention’s boundaries.") (citing
 *Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at 1405-06);
 *Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe, Inc.,* 323 F.3d 956, 968, 63
 USPQ2d 1609, 1616 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (holding that generic claim language appearing in
 *ipsis verbis* in the original specification did not satisfy the
 written description requirement because it failed to support the scope of the genus
 claimed); *Fiers v. Revel,* 984 F.2d 1164, 1170, 25 USPQ2d 1601,
 1606 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (rejecting the argument that "only similar language in the
 specification or original claims is necessary to satisfy the written description
 requirement").
 


The Federal Circuit has explained that a
 specification cannot always support expansive claim language and satisfy the
 requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112 "merely by clearly describing one embodiment of the
 thing claimed." *LizardTech v. Earth Resource Mapping, Inc.,* 424
 F.3d 1336, 1346, 76 USPQ2d 1731, 1733 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The issue is whether a person
 skilled in the art would understand applicant to have invented, and been in
 possession of, the invention as broadly claimed. In *LizardTech,*
 claims to a generic method of making a seamless discrete wavelet transformation (DWT)
 were held invalid under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, because the specification
 taught only one particular method for making a seamless DWT and there was no evidence
 that the specification contemplated a more generic method. "[T]he description of one
 method for creating a seamless DWT does not entitle the inventor . . . to claim any
 and all means for achieving that objective." *LizardTech,* 424 F.3d
 at 1346, 76 USPQ2d at 1733. 
 


Similarly, original claims may lack written
 description when the claims define the invention in functional language specifying a
 desired result but the specification does not sufficiently describe how the function
 is performed or the result is achieved. For software, this can occur when the
 algorithm or steps/procedure for performing the computer function are not explained
 at all or are not explained in sufficient detail (simply restating the function
 recited in the claim is not necessarily sufficient). In other words, the algorithm or
 steps/procedure taken to perform the function must be described with sufficient
 detail so that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand
 how the inventor intended the function to be performed. See
 **[MPEP §§
 2163.02](s2163.html#d0e214553)** and **[2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection IV.
 
 


The level of detail required to satisfy the written
 description requirement varies depending on the nature and scope of the claims and on
 the complexity and predictability of the relevant technology.
 *Ariad,* 598 F.3d at 1351, 94 USPQ2d at 1172; *Capon v.
 Eshhar,* 418 F.3d 1349, 1357-58, 76 USPQ2d 1078, 1083-84 (Fed. Cir.
 2005). Computer-implemented inventions are often disclosed and claimed in terms of
 their functionality. For computer-implemented inventions, the determination of the
 sufficiency of disclosure will require an inquiry into the sufficiency of both the
 disclosed hardware and the disclosed software due to the interrelationship and
 interdependence of computer hardware and software. The critical inquiry is whether
 the disclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in
 the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the
 filing date. *Vasudevan Software, Inc. v. MicroStrategy, Inc.,* 782
 F.3d 671, 682. 114 USPQ2d 1349, 1356 (citing *Ariad Pharm., Inc. V. Eli Lilly
 & Co,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1351, 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2010) in
 the context of determining possession of a claimed means of accessing disparate
 databases). 
 


When examining computer-implemented functional claims,
 examiners should determine whether the specification discloses the computer and the
 algorithm (e.g., the necessary steps and/or flowcharts) that perform the claimed
 function in sufficient detail such that one of ordinary skill in the art can
 reasonably conclude that the inventor possessed the claimed subject matter at the
 time of filing. An algorithm is defined, for example, as "a finite sequence of steps
 for solving a logical or mathematical problem or performing a task." Microsoft
 Computer Dictionary (5th ed., 2002). Applicant may "express that algorithm in any
 understandable terms including as a mathematical formula, in prose, or as a flow
 chart, or in any other manner that provides sufficient structure." *Finisar
 Corp. v. DirecTV Grp., Inc.,* 523 F.3d 1323, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2008)
 (internal citation omitted). It is not enough that one skilled in the art could write
 a program to achieve the claimed function because the specification must explain how
 the inventor intends to achieve the claimed function to satisfy the written
 description requirement. See, e.g., *Vasudevan Software, Inc. v.
 MicroStrategy, Inc.,* 782 F.3d 671, 681-683, 114 USPQ2d 1349, 1356, 1357
 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (reversing and remanding the district court’s grant of summary
 judgment of invalidity for lack of adequate written description where there were
 genuine issues of material fact regarding "whether the specification show[ed]
 possession by the inventor of how accessing disparate databases is achieved"). If the
 specification does not provide a disclosure of the computer and algorithm in
 sufficient detail to demonstrate to one of ordinary skill in the art that the
 inventor possessed the invention a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, for lack of written description must be made. For more information
 regarding the written description requirement, see **[MPEP § 2162](s2162.html#d0e213567)**-
 **[§
 2163.07(b)](s2163.html#d0e215198)**. If the specification does not provide a
 disclosure of sufficient corresponding structure, materials, or acts that perform the
 entire claimed function of a means- (or step-) plus- function limitation in a claim
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or the sixth paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, "the applicant has in effect failed to particularly point
 out and distinctly claim the invention" as required by the **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** [or the second paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**]. *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d 1189,
 1195, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1850 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc). A rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or the second paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** must be made in addition to the written description
 rejection. See also **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection II.B.2(a).
 

**II.****BEST MODE**The purpose of the best mode requirement is to "restrain inventors
 from applying for patents while at the same time concealing from the public the
 preferred embodiments of their inventions which they have in fact conceived."
 *In re Gay,* 309 F.2d 769, 772, 135 USPQ 311, 315 (CCPA 1962).
 Only evidence of concealment, "whether accidental or intentional," is considered in
 judging the adequacy of the disclosure for compliance with the best mode requirement.
 *Spectra-Physics, Inc. v. Coherent, Inc.,*827 F.2d 1524, 1535, 3
 USPQ2d 1737, 1745 (Fed. Cir. 1987). "That evidence, in order to result in affirmance
 of a best mode rejection, must tend to show that the quality of an applicant’s best
 mode disclosure is so poor as to effectively result in concealment." *In re
 Sherwood,* 613 F.2d 809, 816-817, 204 USPQ 537, 544 (CCPA 1980)(emphasis
 omitted); *White Consol. Indus. v. Vega Servo-Control Inc.,* 214
 USPQ 796, 824 (S.D. Mich. 1982), *aff’d on related grounds,* 713
 F.2d 788, 218 USPQ 961 (Fed. Cir. 1983); see also **[MPEP §§ 2165](s2165.html#d0e216924)** -
 **[2165.04](s2165.html#d0e217264)**.
 


There are two factual inquiries to be made in determining whether a
 specification satisfies the best mode requirement. First, there must be a subjective
 determination as to whether the inventor knew of a best mode of practicing the
 invention at the time the application was filed. Second, if the inventor had a best
 mode of practicing the invention in mind, there must be an objective determination as
 to whether that best mode was disclosed in sufficient detail to allow one skilled in
 the art to practice it. *Fonar Corp. v. Gen. Elect. Co.,* 107 F.3d
 1543, 41 USPQ2d 1801, 1804 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *Chemcast Corp. v. Arco
 Indus.,* 913 F.2d 923, 927-28, 16 USPQ2d 1033, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1990). "As
 a general rule, where software constitutes part of a best mode of carrying out an
 invention, description of such a best mode is satisfied by a disclosure of the
 functions of the software. This is because, normally, writing code for such software
 is within the skill of the art, not requiring undue experimentation, once its
 functions have been disclosed. . . . [F]low charts or source code listings are not a
 requirement for adequately disclosing the functions of software." *Fonar
 Corp.,* 107 F.3d at 1549, 41 USPQ2d at 1805 (citations omitted).
 

**III.** **DETERMINING WHETHER THE FULL SCOPE OF A COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONAL CLAIM
 LIMITATION IS ENABLED**To satisfy the enablement requirement of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, the specification must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use
 the full scope of the claimed invention without "undue experimentation." See, e.g.,
 *In re Wright,* 999 F.2d 1557, 1561, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1513 (Fed.
 Cir. 1993); *In re Wands,* 858 F.2d 731, 736-37, 8 USPQ2d 1400, 1402
 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In *In re Wands,* the court set forth the
 following factors to consider when determining whether undue experimentation is
 needed: (1) the breadth of the claims; (2) the nature of the invention; (3) the state
 of the prior art; (4) the level of one of ordinary skill; (5) the level of
 predictability in the art; (6) the amount of direction provided by the inventor; (7)
 the existence of working examples; and (8) the quantity of experimentation needed to
 make or use the invention based on the content of the disclosure. *Wands,* 858 F.2d at 737, 8 USPQ2d 1404. The undue experimentation
 determination is not a single factual determination; rather, it is a conclusion
 reached by weighing all the factual considerations. *Id.*


All questions of enablement under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** are evaluated against the claimed subject matter with
 the focus of the examination inquiry being whether everything within the scope of the
 claim is enabled. Accordingly, examiners should determine what each claim recites and
 what subject matter is encompassed by the claim when the claim is considered as a
 whole and not analyze the claim elements individually.
 


When basing a rejection on the failure of the applicant’s disclosure
 to meet the enablement provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or the first
 paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, USPTO personnel must establish on the
 record a reasonable basis for questioning the adequacy of the
 disclosure to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the
 claimed invention without resorting to *undue experimentation*. See
 *In re Brown,* 477 F.2d 946, 177 USPQ 691 (CCPA 1973);
 *In re Ghiron,* 442 F.2d 985, 169 USPQ 723 (CCPA 1971). Once
 USPTO personnel have advanced a reasonable basis for questioning the adequacy of the
 disclosure, it becomes incumbent on the applicant to rebut that challenge and
 factually demonstrate that the application disclosure is sufficient. See *In
 re Doyle,* 482 F.2d 1385, 1392, 179 USPQ 227, 232 (CCPA 1973);
 *In re Scarbrough,* 500 F.2d 560, 566, 182 USPQ 298, 302 (CCPA
 1974); *In re Ghiron, supra*; see also **[MPEP §§ 2164](s2164.html#d0e215224)** -
 **[2164.08(c)](s2164.html#d0e216899)**.
 


When a claim is not limited to any particular
 structure for performing a recited function and does not invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**, any claim language reciting the ability to perform a
 function per se would typically be construed broadly to cover any and all embodiments
 that perform the recited function. Because such a claim encompasses all devices or
 structures that perform the recited function, there is a concern regarding whether
 the applicant's disclosure sufficiently enables the full scope of protection sought
 by the claim. *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 213, 169 USPQ 226,
 229 (CCPA 1971); *AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac,* 344 F.3d 1234, 1244, 68
 USPQ2d 1280, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2003); *In re Moore,* 439 F.2d 1232,
 1236, 169 USPQ 236, 239 (CCPA 1971). Applicants who present broad claim language must
 ensure the claims are fully enabled. Specifically, the scope of the claims must be
 less than or equal to the scope of the enablement provided by the specification.
 *Sitrick v. Dreamworks, LLC,* 516 F.3d 993, 999, 85 USPQ2d 1826,
 1830 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("The scope of the claims must be less than or equal to the
 scope of the enablement to ensure that the public knowledge is enriched by the patent
 specification to a degree at least commensurate with the scope of the claims."
 (quotation omitted)). 
 


For example, the claims in *Sitrick*
 were directed to "integrating" or "substituting" a user’s audio signal or visual
 image into a pre-existing video game or movie. While the claims covered both video
 games and movies, the specification only taught the skilled artisan how to substitute
 and integrate user images into video games. The Federal Circuit held that the
 specification failed to enable the full scope of the claims because the skilled
 artisan could not substitute a user image for a preexisting character image in movies
 without undue experimentation. Specifically, the court recognized that one skilled in
 the art could not apply the teachings of the specification regarding video games to
 movies, because movies, unlike video games, do not have easily separable character
 functions. Because the specification did not teach how the substitution and
 integration of character functions for a user image would be accomplished in movies,
 the claims were not enabled. *Sitrick,* 516 F.3d at 999-1001, 85
 USPQ2d at 1830-32. 
 


In *MagSil Corp. v. Hitachi Global Storage
 Techs., Inc.* 687 F.3d 1377, 103 USPQ2d 1769 (Fed. Cir. 2012), the
 Federal Circuit stated that "a patentee chooses broad claim language at the peril of
 losing any claim that cannot be enabled across its full scope of coverage," finding
 "one skilled in the art could not have taken the disclosure in the specification
 regarding ‘change in the resistance by at least 10% at room temperature’ and achieved
 a change in resistance in the full scope of that term without undue experimentation."
 687 F.3d at 1381-82. "Thus, the specification enabled a marginal advance over the
 prior art, but did not enable at the time of filing a tunnel junction of resistive
 changes reaching even up to 20%, let alone the more recent achievements above 600%."
 The court held that the "claims [were] invalid for lack of enablement because their
 broad scope [was] not reasonably supported by the scope of enablement in the
 specification." 687 F.3d at 1381-1382, 1384, 103 USPQ2d at 1771, 1772, 1774 ("MagSil
 did not fully enable its broad claim scope. Therefore, it cannot claim an exclusive
 right to exclude later tri-layer tunnel junctions that greatly exceed a 10% resistive
 change."). See also *Convolve, Inc. v. Compaq Computer Corp.,* 527
 Fed. App'x 910, 931 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (non-precedential), quoting *MagSil
 Corp.*)(affirming grant of summary judgment of invalidity due to lack of
 enablement where the patentee "[b]y choosing such broad claim language, ... put
 itself ‘at the peril of losing any claim that cannot be enabled across its full scope
 of coverage.’"). 
 


The specification need not teach what is well known in
 the art. However, applicant cannot rely on the knowledge of one skilled in the art to
 supply information that is required to enable the novel aspect of the claimed
 invention when the enabling knowledge is in fact not known in the art. *ALZA
 Corp. v. Andrx Pharms., LLC,* 603 F.3d 935, 941, 94 USPQ2d 1823, 1827
 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ("ALZA was required to provide an adequate enabling disclosure in
 the specification; it cannot simply rely on the knowledge of a person of ordinary
 skill to serve as a substitute for the missing information in the specification.");
 *Auto. Techs. Int’l, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc.,* 501 F.3d 1274,
 1283, 84 USPQ2d 1108, 1114-15 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("Although the knowledge of one
 skilled in the art is indeed relevant, the novel aspect of an invention must be
 enabled in the patent."). The Federal Circuit has stated that "‘[i]t is the
 specification, not the knowledge of one skilled in the art, that must supply the
 novel aspects of an invention in order to constitute adequate enablement.’"
 *Auto. Technologies,* 501 F.3d at 1283, 84 USPQ2d at 1115
 (quoting *Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S,* 108 F.3d 1361, 1366,
 42 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). The rule that a specification need not
 disclose what is well known in the art is "merely a rule of supplementation, not a
 substitute for a basic enabling disclosure." *Genentech,* 108 F.3d
 at 1366, 42 USPQ2d 1005; see also *ALZA Corp.,* 603 F.3d at 940-41,
 94 USPQ2d at 1827. Therefore, the specification must contain the information
 necessary to enable the novel aspects of the claimed invention.
 *Id.* at 941, 94 USPQ2d at 1827; *Auto.
 Technologies,* 501 F.3d at 1283-84, 84 USPQ2d at 1115 ("[T]he ‘omission
 of minor details does not cause a specification to fail to meet the enablement
 requirement. However, when there is no disclosure of any specific starting material
 or of any of the conditions under which a process can be carried out, undue
 experimentation is required.’") (quoting *Genentech,* 108 F.3d at
 1366, 42 USPQ2d at 1005). For instance, in *Auto. Technologies,* the
 claim limitation "means responsive to the motion of said mass" was construed to
 include both mechanical side impact sensors and electronic side impact sensors for
 performing the function of initiating an occupant protection apparatus.
 *Auto. Technologies,* 501 F.3d at 1282, 84 USPQ2d at 1114. The
 specification did not include any discussion of the details or circuitry involved in
 the electronic side impact sensor and thus, failed to apprise one of ordinary skill
 how to make and use the electronic sensor. Because the novel aspect of the invention
 was side impact sensors, the patentee could not rely on the knowledge of one skilled
 in the art to supply the missing information. *Auto. Technologies,*
 501 F.3d at 1283, 84 USPQ2d at 1114.
 


Not everything necessary to practice the invention
 need be disclosed. *Trs. of Bos. Univ. v. Everlight Elecs. Co.,
 LTD.,* 896 F.3d 1357, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (explaining that while "the
 specification must enable the full scope of the claimed invention[,]" "[t]his is not
 to say that the specification must expressly spell out every possible iteration of
 every claim."). For instance, "‘a specification need not disclose what is well known
 in the art.’" *Id.* (quoting *Genentech, Inc.v. Novo Nordisk
 A/S,* 108 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); see also *AK Steel
 Corp. v. Sollac & Ugine,* 344 F.3d 1234, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 2003). This
 is of particular importance with respect to computer-implemented inventions due to
 the high level of skill in the art and the similarly high level of predictability in
 generating programs to achieve an intended result without undue experimentation. See
 **[MPEP §
 2164.08](s2164.html#d0e216700)**.
 


The Federal Circuit has repeatedly held that the
 specification must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full scope
 of the claimed invention without undue experimentation. See *Trs. of Bos.
 Univ.,* 896 F.3d at 1364 ("‘The scope of enablement . . . is that which
 is disclosed in the specification plus the scope of what would be known to one of
 ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.’" (quoting *Nat’l
 Recovery Techs., Inc. v. Magnetic Separation Sys., Inc.,* 166 F.3d 1190,
 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1999))). For example, in *Sitrick v. Dreamworks,
 LLC,* 516 F.3d 993 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the claims at issue were directed to
 "integrating" or "substituting" a user’s audio signal or visual image into a
 pre-existing video game or movie. *Id.* at 995-97. While the claims
 covered both video games and movies, the specification only taught the skilled
 artisan how to substitute and integrate user images into video games.
 *Id.* at 1000. The Federal Circuit held that the specification
 "did not enable the full scope of the asserted claims" because "one skilled in the
 art could not take the disclosure in the specification with respect to substitution
 or integration of user images in video games and substitute a user image for a pre-
 existing character image in movies without undue experimentation."

 U.S.C. 112(a) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph [R-10.2019]


The statutory requirements for computer-implemented
 inventions are the same as for all inventions, such as the subject matter eligibility
 and utility requirements under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** (see
 **[MPEP §§
 2106](s2106.html#d0e197244)** and **[2107](s2107.html#d0e198469)**, respectively), the novelty
 requirement of **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the nonobviousness requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the
 definiteness requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, and the three separate and distinct
 requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. In addition, claims with
 computer-implemented functional claim limitations may invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. See **[MPEP §
 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection II.B, and **[§ 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection
 IV. for information regarding means- (or step-) plus- function limitations.
 


Even if a claim is not construed as a means-plus-
 function limitation under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**,
 computer-implemented functional claim language must still be evaluated for sufficient
 disclosure under the written description and enablement requirements of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**.
 

**I.** **DETERMINING WHETHER THERE IS ADEQUATE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION FOR A
 COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONAL CLAIM LIMITATION**The **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or first
 paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** contains a written description
 requirement that is separate and distinct from the enablement requirement.
 *Ariad Pharm., Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co.,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1340,
 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2010) *(en banc)*. To satisfy the
 written description requirement, the specification must describe the claimed
 invention in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can reasonably conclude
 that the inventor had possession of the claimed invention at the time of filing.
 *Reiffin v. Microsoft Corp.,* 214 F.3d 1342, 1345 (Fed. Cir.
 2000) ("The purpose of [the written description requirement] is to ensure that the
 scope of the right to exclude, as set forth in the claims, does not overreach the
 scope of the inventor’s contribution to the field of art as described in the patent
 specification"); *LizardTech Inc. v. Earth Resource Mapping Inc.,*
 424 F.3d 1336, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("Whether the flaw in the specification is
 regarded as a failure to demonstrate that the applicant possessed the full scope of
 the invention recited in [the claim] or a failure to enable the full breadth of that
 claim, the specification provides inadequate support for the claim under
 [**[§
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**]"); cf. *id.* ("A claim will not be
 invalidated on **[[§] 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** grounds simply because
 the embodiments of the specification do not contain examples explicitly covering the
 full scope of the claim language."). While "[t]here is no special rule for supporting
 a genus by the disclosure of a species," the Federal Circuit has stated that
 "[w]hether the genus is supported vel non depends upon the state of the art and the
 nature and breadth of the genus." *Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus
 Inc.,* 645 F.3d 1336, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2011); *id.*
 (further explaining that "so long as disclosure of the species is sufficient to
 convey to one skilled in the art that the inventor possessed the subject matter of
 the genus, the genus will be supported by an adequate written description."). See
 also *Rivera v. Int'l Trade Comm’n,* 857 F.3d 1315, 1319-21 (Fed.
 Cir. 2017) (affirming the Commission’s findings that "the specification did not
 provide the necessary written description support for the full breadth of the
 asserted claims," where the claims were broadly drawn to a "container . . . adapted
 to hold brewing material" while the specification disclosed only a "pod adapter
 assembly" or "receptacle" designed to hold a "pod"). 
 


 Specifically, the specification must describe the
 claimed invention in a manner understandable to a person of ordinary skill in the art
 in a way that shows that the inventor actually invented the claimed invention at the
 time of filing. *Id.;**Ariad,* 598 F.3d at 1351, 94 USPQ2d at 1172. The function of the
 written description requirement is to ensure that the inventor had possession of the
 specific subject matter later claimed as of the filing date of the application relied
 on; how the specification accomplishes this is not material. *In re
 Herschler,* 591 F.2d 693, 700-01, 200 USPQ 711, 717 (CCPA 1979), further
 reiterated in *In re Kaslow,* 707 F.2d 1366, 217 USPQ 1089 (Fed.
 Cir. 1983); see also **[MPEP §§ 2163](s2163.html#d0e213583)** - **[2163.04](s2163.html#d0e214731)**. 
 


The written description requirement of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, applies to all claims including original claims that are part of the
 disclosure as filed. *Ariad,* 598 F.3d at 1349, 94 USPQ2d at 1170.
 As stated by the Federal Circuit, "[a]lthough many original claims will satisfy the
 written description requirement, certain claims may not." *Id.* at
 1349, 94 USPQ2d at 1170-71; see also *LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Res. Mapping,
 Inc.,* 424 F.3d 1336, 1343-46, 76 USPQ2d 1724, 1730-33 (Fed. Cir. 2005);
 *Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co.,* 119 F.3d
 1559, 1568, 43 USPQ2d 1398, 1405-06 (Fed. Cir. 1997)("The description requirement of
 the patent statute requires a description of an invention, not an indication of a
 result that one might achieve if one made that invention."). Problems satisfying the
 written description requirement for original claims often occur when claim language
 is generic or functional, or both. *Ariad,* 593 F.3d at 1349, 94
 USPQ2d at 1171 ("The problem is especially acute with genus claims that use
 functional language to define the boundaries of a claimed genus. In such a case, the
 functional claim may simply claim a desired result, and may do so without describing
 species that achieve that result. But the specification must demonstrate that the
 applicant has made a generic invention that achieves the claimed result and do so by
 showing that the applicant has invented species sufficient to support a claim to the
 functionally-defined genus.").
 


For instance, generic claim language in the original
 disclosure does not satisfy the written description requirement if it fails to
 support the scope of the genus claimed. *Ariad,* 598 F.3d at
 1349-50, 94 USPQ2d at 1171 ("[A]n adequate written description of a claimed genus
 requires more than a generic statement of an invention’s boundaries.") (citing
 *Eli Lilly,* 119 F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at 1405-06);
 *Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe, Inc.,* 323 F.3d 956, 968, 63
 USPQ2d 1609, 1616 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (holding that generic claim language appearing in
 *ipsis verbis* in the original specification did not satisfy the
 written description requirement because it failed to support the scope of the genus
 claimed); *Fiers v. Revel,* 984 F.2d 1164, 1170, 25 USPQ2d 1601,
 1606 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (rejecting the argument that "only similar language in the
 specification or original claims is necessary to satisfy the written description
 requirement").
 


The Federal Circuit has explained that a
 specification cannot always support expansive claim language and satisfy the
 requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112 "merely by clearly describing one embodiment of the
 thing claimed." *LizardTech v. Earth Resource Mapping, Inc.,* 424
 F.3d 1336, 1346, 76 USPQ2d 1731, 1733 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The issue is whether a person
 skilled in the art would understand applicant to have invented, and been in
 possession of, the invention as broadly claimed. In *LizardTech,*
 claims to a generic method of making a seamless discrete wavelet transformation (DWT)
 were held invalid under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, because the specification
 taught only one particular method for making a seamless DWT and there was no evidence
 that the specification contemplated a more generic method. "[T]he description of one
 method for creating a seamless DWT does not entitle the inventor . . . to claim any
 and all means for achieving that objective." *LizardTech,* 424 F.3d
 at 1346, 76 USPQ2d at 1733. 
 


Similarly, original claims may lack written
 description when the claims define the invention in functional language specifying a
 desired result but the specification does not sufficiently describe how the function
 is performed or the result is achieved. For software, this can occur when the
 algorithm or steps/procedure for performing the computer function are not explained
 at all or are not explained in sufficient detail (simply restating the function
 recited in the claim is not necessarily sufficient). In other words, the algorithm or
 steps/procedure taken to perform the function must be described with sufficient
 detail so that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand
 how the inventor intended the function to be performed. See
 **[MPEP §§
 2163.02](s2163.html#d0e214553)** and **[2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection IV.
 
 


The level of detail required to satisfy the written
 description requirement varies depending on the nature and scope of the claims and on
 the complexity and predictability of the relevant technology.
 *Ariad,* 598 F.3d at 1351, 94 USPQ2d at 1172; *Capon v.
 Eshhar,* 418 F.3d 1349, 1357-58, 76 USPQ2d 1078, 1083-84 (Fed. Cir.
 2005). Computer-implemented inventions are often disclosed and claimed in terms of
 their functionality. For computer-implemented inventions, the determination of the
 sufficiency of disclosure will require an inquiry into the sufficiency of both the
 disclosed hardware and the disclosed software due to the interrelationship and
 interdependence of computer hardware and software. The critical inquiry is whether
 the disclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in
 the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the
 filing date. *Vasudevan Software, Inc. v. MicroStrategy, Inc.,* 782
 F.3d 671, 682. 114 USPQ2d 1349, 1356 (citing *Ariad Pharm., Inc. V. Eli Lilly
 & Co,* 598 F.3d 1336, 1351, 94 USPQ2d 1161, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2010) in
 the context of determining possession of a claimed means of accessing disparate
 databases). 
 


When examining computer-implemented functional claims,
 examiners should determine whether the specification discloses the computer and the
 algorithm (e.g., the necessary steps and/or flowcharts) that perform the claimed
 function in sufficient detail such that one of ordinary skill in the art can
 reasonably conclude that the inventor possessed the claimed subject matter at the
 time of filing. An algorithm is defined, for example, as "a finite sequence of steps
 for solving a logical or mathematical problem or performing a task." Microsoft
 Computer Dictionary (5th ed., 2002). Applicant may "express that algorithm in any
 understandable terms including as a mathematical formula, in prose, or as a flow
 chart, or in any other manner that provides sufficient structure." *Finisar
 Corp. v. DirecTV Grp., Inc.,* 523 F.3d 1323, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2008)
 (internal citation omitted). It is not enough that one skilled in the art could write
 a program to achieve the claimed function because the specification must explain how
 the inventor intends to achieve the claimed function to satisfy the written
 description requirement. See, e.g., *Vasudevan Software, Inc. v.
 MicroStrategy, Inc.,* 782 F.3d 671, 681-683, 114 USPQ2d 1349, 1356, 1357
 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (reversing and remanding the district court’s grant of summary
 judgment of invalidity for lack of adequate written description where there were
 genuine issues of material fact regarding "whether the specification show[ed]
 possession by the inventor of how accessing disparate databases is achieved"). If the
 specification does not provide a disclosure of the computer and algorithm in
 sufficient detail to demonstrate to one of ordinary skill in the art that the
 inventor possessed the invention a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, for lack of written description must be made. For more information
 regarding the written description requirement, see **[MPEP § 2162](s2162.html#d0e213567)**-
 **[§
 2163.07(b)](s2163.html#d0e215198)**. If the specification does not provide a
 disclosure of sufficient corresponding structure, materials, or acts that perform the
 entire claimed function of a means- (or step-) plus- function limitation in a claim
 under **[35
 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or the sixth paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, "the applicant has in effect failed to particularly point
 out and distinctly claim the invention" as required by the **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** [or the second paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**]. *In re Donaldson Co.,* 16 F.3d 1189,
 1195, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1850 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc). A rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or the second paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** must be made in addition to the written description
 rejection. See also **[MPEP § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**, subsection II.B.2(a).
 

**II.****BEST MODE**The purpose of the best mode requirement is to "restrain inventors
 from applying for patents while at the same time concealing from the public the
 preferred embodiments of their inventions which they have in fact conceived."
 *In re Gay,* 309 F.2d 769, 772, 135 USPQ 311, 315 (CCPA 1962).
 Only evidence of concealment, "whether accidental or intentional," is considered in
 judging the adequacy of the disclosure for compliance with the best mode requirement.
 *Spectra-Physics, Inc. v. Coherent, Inc.,*827 F.2d 1524, 1535, 3
 USPQ2d 1737, 1745 (Fed. Cir. 1987). "That evidence, in order to result in affirmance
 of a best mode rejection, must tend to show that the quality of an applicant’s best
 mode disclosure is so poor as to effectively result in concealment." *In re
 Sherwood,* 613 F.2d 809, 816-817, 204 USPQ 537, 544 (CCPA 1980)(emphasis
 omitted); *White Consol. Indus. v. Vega Servo-Control Inc.,* 214
 USPQ 796, 824 (S.D. Mich. 1982), *aff’d on related grounds,* 713
 F.2d 788, 218 USPQ 961 (Fed. Cir. 1983); see also **[MPEP §§ 2165](s2165.html#d0e216924)** -
 **[2165.04](s2165.html#d0e217264)**.
 


There are two factual inquiries to be made in determining whether a
 specification satisfies the best mode requirement. First, there must be a subjective
 determination as to whether the inventor knew of a best mode of practicing the
 invention at the time the application was filed. Second, if the inventor had a best
 mode of practicing the invention in mind, there must be an objective determination as
 to whether that best mode was disclosed in sufficient detail to allow one skilled in
 the art to practice it. *Fonar Corp. v. Gen. Elect. Co.,* 107 F.3d
 1543, 41 USPQ2d 1801, 1804 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *Chemcast Corp. v. Arco
 Indus.,* 913 F.2d 923, 927-28, 16 USPQ2d 1033, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1990). "As
 a general rule, where software constitutes part of a best mode of carrying out an
 invention, description of such a best mode is satisfied by a disclosure of the
 functions of the software. This is because, normally, writing code for such software
 is within the skill of the art, not requiring undue experimentation, once its
 functions have been disclosed. . . . [F]low charts or source code listings are not a
 requirement for adequately disclosing the functions of software." *Fonar
 Corp.,* 107 F.3d at 1549, 41 USPQ2d at 1805 (citations omitted).
 

**III.** **DETERMINING WHETHER THE FULL SCOPE OF A COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONAL CLAIM
 LIMITATION IS ENABLED**To satisfy the enablement requirement of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, the specification must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use
 the full scope of the claimed invention without "undue experimentation." See, e.g.,
 *In re Wright,* 999 F.2d 1557, 1561, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1513 (Fed.
 Cir. 1993); *In re Wands,* 858 F.2d 731, 736-37, 8 USPQ2d 1400, 1402
 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In *In re Wands,* the court set forth the
 following factors to consider when determining whether undue experimentation is
 needed: (1) the breadth of the claims; (2) the nature of the invention; (3) the state
 of the prior art; (4) the level of one of ordinary skill; (5) the level of
 predictability in the art; (6) the amount of direction provided by the inventor; (7)
 the existence of working examples; and (8) the quantity of experimentation needed to
 make or use the invention based on the content of the disclosure. *Wands,* 858 F.2d at 737, 8 USPQ2d 1404. The undue experimentation
 determination is not a single factual determination; rather, it is a conclusion
 reached by weighing all the factual considerations. *Id.*


All questions of enablement under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** are evaluated against the claimed subject matter with
 the focus of the examination inquiry being whether everything within the scope of the
 claim is enabled. Accordingly, examiners should determine what each claim recites and
 what subject matter is encompassed by the claim when the claim is considered as a
 whole and not analyze the claim elements individually.
 


When basing a rejection on the failure of the applicant’s disclosure
 to meet the enablement provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or the first
 paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, USPTO personnel must establish on the
 record a reasonable basis for questioning the adequacy of the
 disclosure to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the
 claimed invention without resorting to *undue experimentation*. See
 *In re Brown,* 477 F.2d 946, 177 USPQ 691 (CCPA 1973);
 *In re Ghiron,* 442 F.2d 985, 169 USPQ 723 (CCPA 1971). Once
 USPTO personnel have advanced a reasonable basis for questioning the adequacy of the
 disclosure, it becomes incumbent on the applicant to rebut that challenge and
 factually demonstrate that the application disclosure is sufficient. See *In
 re Doyle,* 482 F.2d 1385, 1392, 179 USPQ 227, 232 (CCPA 1973);
 *In re Scarbrough,* 500 F.2d 560, 566, 182 USPQ 298, 302 (CCPA
 1974); *In re Ghiron, supra*; see also **[MPEP §§ 2164](s2164.html#d0e215224)** -
 **[2164.08(c)](s2164.html#d0e216899)**.
 


When a claim is not limited to any particular
 structure for performing a recited function and does not invoke **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**, any claim language reciting the ability to perform a
 function per se would typically be construed broadly to cover any and all embodiments
 that perform the recited function. Because such a claim encompasses all devices or
 structures that perform the recited function, there is a concern regarding whether
 the applicant's disclosure sufficiently enables the full scope of protection sought
 by the claim. *In re Swinehart,* 439 F.2d 210, 213, 169 USPQ 226,
 229 (CCPA 1971); *AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac,* 344 F.3d 1234, 1244, 68
 USPQ2d 1280, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2003); *In re Moore,* 439 F.2d 1232,
 1236, 169 USPQ 236, 239 (CCPA 1971). Applicants who present broad claim language must
 ensure the claims are fully enabled. Specifically, the scope of the claims must be
 less than or equal to the scope of the enablement provided by the specification.
 *Sitrick v. Dreamworks, LLC,* 516 F.3d 993, 999, 85 USPQ2d 1826,
 1830 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("The scope of the claims must be less than or equal to the
 scope of the enablement to ensure that the public knowledge is enriched by the patent
 specification to a degree at least commensurate with the scope of the claims."
 (quotation omitted)). 
 


For example, the claims in *Sitrick*
 were directed to "integrating" or "substituting" a user’s audio signal or visual
 image into a pre-existing video game or movie. While the claims covered both video
 games and movies, the specification only taught the skilled artisan how to substitute
 and integrate user images into video games. The Federal Circuit held that the
 specification failed to enable the full scope of the claims because the skilled
 artisan could not substitute a user image for a preexisting character image in movies
 without undue experimentation. Specifically, the court recognized that one skilled in
 the art could not apply the teachings of the specification regarding video games to
 movies, because movies, unlike video games, do not have easily separable character
 functions. Because the specification did not teach how the substitution and
 integration of character functions for a user image would be accomplished in movies,
 the claims were not enabled. *Sitrick,* 516 F.3d at 999-1001, 85
 USPQ2d at 1830-32. 
 


In *MagSil Corp. v. Hitachi Global Storage
 Techs., Inc.* 687 F.3d 1377, 103 USPQ2d 1769 (Fed. Cir. 2012), the
 Federal Circuit stated that "a patentee chooses broad claim language at the peril of
 losing any claim that cannot be enabled across its full scope of coverage," finding
 "one skilled in the art could not have taken the disclosure in the specification
 regarding ‘change in the resistance by at least 10% at room temperature’ and achieved
 a change in resistance in the full scope of that term without undue experimentation."
 687 F.3d at 1381-82. "Thus, the specification enabled a marginal advance over the
 prior art, but did not enable at the time of filing a tunnel junction of resistive
 changes reaching even up to 20%, let alone the more recent achievements above 600%."
 The court held that the "claims [were] invalid for lack of enablement because their
 broad scope [was] not reasonably supported by the scope of enablement in the
 specification." 687 F.3d at 1381-1382, 1384, 103 USPQ2d at 1771, 1772, 1774 ("MagSil
 did not fully enable its broad claim scope. Therefore, it cannot claim an exclusive
 right to exclude later tri-layer tunnel junctions that greatly exceed a 10% resistive
 change."). See also *Convolve, Inc. v. Compaq Computer Corp.,* 527
 Fed. App'x 910, 931 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (non-precedential), quoting *MagSil
 Corp.*)(affirming grant of summary judgment of invalidity due to lack of
 enablement where the patentee "[b]y choosing such broad claim language, ... put
 itself ‘at the peril of losing any claim that cannot be enabled across its full scope
 of coverage.’"). 
 


The specification need not teach what is well known in
 the art. However, applicant cannot rely on the knowledge of one skilled in the art to
 supply information that is required to enable the novel aspect of the claimed
 invention when the enabling knowledge is in fact not known in the art. *ALZA
 Corp. v. Andrx Pharms., LLC,* 603 F.3d 935, 941, 94 USPQ2d 1823, 1827
 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ("ALZA was required to provide an adequate enabling disclosure in
 the specification; it cannot simply rely on the knowledge of a person of ordinary
 skill to serve as a substitute for the missing information in the specification.");
 *Auto. Techs. Int’l, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc.,* 501 F.3d 1274,
 1283, 84 USPQ2d 1108, 1114-15 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("Although the knowledge of one
 skilled in the art is indeed relevant, the novel aspect of an invention must be
 enabled in the patent."). The Federal Circuit has stated that "‘[i]t is the
 specification, not the knowledge of one skilled in the art, that must supply the
 novel aspects of an invention in order to constitute adequate enablement.’"
 *Auto. Technologies,* 501 F.3d at 1283, 84 USPQ2d at 1115
 (quoting *Genentech, Inc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S,* 108 F.3d 1361, 1366,
 42 USPQ2d 1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). The rule that a specification need not
 disclose what is well known in the art is "merely a rule of supplementation, not a
 substitute for a basic enabling disclosure." *Genentech,* 108 F.3d
 at 1366, 42 USPQ2d 1005; see also *ALZA Corp.,* 603 F.3d at 940-41,
 94 USPQ2d at 1827. Therefore, the specification must contain the information
 necessary to enable the novel aspects of the claimed invention.
 *Id.* at 941, 94 USPQ2d at 1827; *Auto.
 Technologies,* 501 F.3d at 1283-84, 84 USPQ2d at 1115 ("[T]he ‘omission
 of minor details does not cause a specification to fail to meet the enablement
 requirement. However, when there is no disclosure of any specific starting material
 or of any of the conditions under which a process can be carried out, undue
 experimentation is required.’") (quoting *Genentech,* 108 F.3d at
 1366, 42 USPQ2d at 1005). For instance, in *Auto. Technologies,* the
 claim limitation "means responsive to the motion of said mass" was construed to
 include both mechanical side impact sensors and electronic side impact sensors for
 performing the function of initiating an occupant protection apparatus.
 *Auto. Technologies,* 501 F.3d at 1282, 84 USPQ2d at 1114. The
 specification did not include any discussion of the details or circuitry involved in
 the electronic side impact sensor and thus, failed to apprise one of ordinary skill
 how to make and use the electronic sensor. Because the novel aspect of the invention
 was side impact sensors, the patentee could not rely on the knowledge of one skilled
 in the art to supply the missing information. *Auto. Technologies,*
 501 F.3d at 1283, 84 USPQ2d at 1114.
 


Not everything necessary to practice the invention
 need be disclosed. *Trs. of Bos. Univ. v. Everlight Elecs. Co.,
 LTD.,* 896 F.3d 1357, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (explaining that while "the
 specification must enable the full scope of the claimed invention[,]" "[t]his is not
 to say that the specification must expressly spell out every possible iteration of
 every claim."). For instance, "‘a specification need not disclose what is well known
 in the art.’" *Id.* (quoting *Genentech, Inc.v. Novo Nordisk
 A/S,* 108 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); see also *AK Steel
 Corp. v. Sollac & Ugine,* 344 F.3d 1234, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 2003). This
 is of particular importance with respect to computer-implemented inventions due to
 the high level of skill in the art and the similarly high level of predictability in
 generating programs to achieve an intended result without undue experimentation. See
 **[MPEP §
 2164.08](s2164.html#d0e216700)**.
 


The Federal Circuit has repeatedly held that the
 specification must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full scope
 of the claimed invention without undue experimentation. See *Trs. of Bos.
 Univ.,* 896 F.3d at 1364 ("‘The scope of enablement . . . is that which
 is disclosed in the specification plus the scope of what would be known to one of
 ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.’" (quoting *Nat’l
 Recovery Techs., Inc. v. Magnetic Separation Sys., Inc.,* 166 F.3d 1190,
 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1999))). For example, in *Sitrick v. Dreamworks,
 LLC,* 516 F.3d 993 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the claims at issue were directed to
 "integrating" or "substituting" a user’s audio signal or visual image into a
 pre-existing video game or movie. *Id.* at 995-97. While the claims
 covered both video games and movies, the specification only taught the skilled
 artisan how to substitute and integrate user images into video games.
 *Id.* at 1000. The Federal Circuit held that the specification
 "did not enable the full scope of the asserted claims" because "one skilled in the
 art could not take the disclosure in the specification with respect to substitution
 or integration of user images in video games and substitute a user image for a pre-
 existing character image in movies without undue experimentation."
 *Id.*
