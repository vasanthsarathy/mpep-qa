# 2148 Form Paragraphs for Use in Rejections Under
 Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103 [R-10.2019]


The following form paragraphs should be used in making the
 appropriate rejections under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.
 


# ¶ 7.06 Notice re prior art available under both pre-AIA and
 AIA


In the event the determination of the status of the application as subject
 to AIA **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** (or as subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**)
 is incorrect, any correction of the statutory basis for the rejection will not be considered a
 new ground of rejection if the prior art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the
 rejection, would be the same under either status.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1.  This form paragraph must be used in all Office
 Actions when a prior art rejection is made in an application with an actual filing
 date on or after March 16, 2013, that claims priority to, or the benefit of, an
 application filed before March 16, 2013.
* 2.  This form paragraph should only be used ONCE in an
 Office action.



# ¶ 7.20.fti Statement of Statutory Basis, Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)


The following is a quotation of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**
 which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:
 



> 
> (a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not
>  identically disclosed or described as set forth in section **[102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, if the
>  differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such
>  that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was
>  made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.
>  Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made. 
>  
> 
> 
> 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. The statute is not to be cited in
 all Office actions. It is only required in first actions on
 the merits employing **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** and final
 rejections. Where the statute is being applied, but is not cited in an action on the
 merits, use paragraph **[7.103](#fp7.103)**.
* 2. This form paragraph should only be used ONCE in a
 given Office action.
* 3. This form paragraph must precede form paragraphs
 **[7.20.01.fti](#fp7.20.01.fti)** - **[7.22.fti](#fp7.22.fti)** when this form paragraph is
 used to cite the statute in first actions and final rejections.



# ¶ 7.20.01.fti Pre-AIA 103(a) Rejection Using Prior Art Under Pre-AIA 102(e),
 (f), or (g) That Is Not Disqualified Under Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c) Because Reference Is Prior
 Art Under Another Subsection of Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102


Applicant has provided a submission in this file that the invention
 was owned by, or subject to an obligation of assignment to, the same entity as
 **[1]** at the time this invention was made, or was subject to a joint research
 agreement at the time this invention was made. However, reference **[2]** qualifies
 as prior art under another subsection of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, and therefore is
 not disqualified as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**.
 


Applicant may overcome the applied art either by a showing
 under **[37 CFR
 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** that the invention disclosed therein was derived from the inventor
 of this application, and is therefore, not the invention "by another," or by antedating the
 applied art under **[37 CFR 1.131(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512)**.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This form paragraph must be included following form paragraph
 7.20.fti in all actions containing rejections under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** using art
 that is disqualified under **[pre-AIA 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** using
 **[pre-AIA
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, **[(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)**, or **[(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)**, but which
 qualifies under another section of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.
* 2. In bracket 1, identify the common
 assignee.
* 3. In bracket 2, identify the reference which has been
 disqualified.



# ¶ 7.20.02.fti Joint Inventors, Common Ownership Presumed


This application currently names joint inventors. In considering
 patentability of the claims under pre-AIA **[35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**, the examiner presumes
 that the subject matter of the various claims was commonly owned at the time any inventions
 covered therein were made absent any evidence to the contrary. Applicant is advised of the
 obligation under **[37 CFR
 1.56](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e319407)** to point out the inventor and invention dates of each claim that
 was not commonly owned at the time a later invention was made in order for the examiner to
 consider the applicability of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** and potential
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, **[(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** or **[(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** prior art under pre-AIA
 **[35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * This paragraph must be used in all applications with
 joint inventors (unless the claims are clearly restricted to only one claimed invention,
 e.g., only a single claim is presented in the application).



# ¶ 7.20.04.fti Pre-AIA 103(a) Rejection Using Prior Art Under Pre-AIA 102(e),
 (f), or (g) That Is Attempted To Be Disqualified Under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c) Using the
 Common Ownership or Assignment Provision


Applicant has attempted to disqualify reference **[1]** under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** by showing that the invention was owned by, or subject to an
 obligation of assignment to, the same entity as **[2]** at the time this invention
 was made. However, applicant has failed to provide a statement that the application and the
 reference were owned by, or subject to an obligation of assignment to, the same person at the
 time the invention was made in a conspicuous manner, and therefore, the reference is not
 disqualified as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**. Applicant must
 file the required submission in order to properly disqualify the reference under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**. See **[MPEP § 2146.02](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_12765_27)**, subsection II.
 


In addition, applicant may overcome the applied art either
 by a showing under **[37
 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** that the invention disclosed therein was derived from the
 inventor of this application, and is therefore not the invention "by another," or by
 antedating the applied art under **[37 CFR 1.131(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512)**.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This form paragraph must be included in all actions containing
 rejections under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** where an attempt has been made to
 disqualify the reference under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**, but where
 the applicant has not provided a proper statement indicating common ownership or
 assignment **at the time the invention was made**.
* 2. In brackets 1 and 2, identify the commonly owned
 applied art (e.g., patent or co-pending application).



# ¶ 7.20.05.fti Pre-AIA 103(a) Rejection Using Prior Art Under Pre-AIA 102(e),
 (f), or (g) That Is Attempted To Be Disqualified Under Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c) Using the
 Joint Research Agreement Provisions


Applicant has attempted to disqualify reference **[1]** under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** by showing that the invention was subject to a joint research
 agreement at the time this invention was made. However, applicant has failed to
 **[2]**. Applicant must file the missing requirements in order to properly
 disqualify the reference under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**. See
 **[37 CFR
 1.71(g)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320173)** and **[1.104(c)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322163)** and **[MPEP §
 2146.02](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_12765_27)**, subsection III.
 


In addition, applicant may overcome the applied art either
 by a showing under **[37
 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** that the invention disclosed therein was derived from the
 inventor of this application, and is therefore, not the invention "by another," or by
 antedating the applied art under **[37 CFR 1.131(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512)**.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This form paragraph must be included in all actions containing
 rejections under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** where an attempt has been made to
 disqualify the reference under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** using the
 joint research agreement provisions but the disqualification attempt is ineffective.
* 2. In bracket 1, identify the reference which is sought to be
 disqualified under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**.
* 3. In bracket 2, identify the reason(s) why the disqualification
 attempt is ineffective. The reason(s) could be noncompliance with the statutory
 requirements of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** or rule requirements relating to the
 CREATE Act, such as failure to submit the required statement or failure to amend the
 specification to include the names of the parties to the joint research agreement. See
 **[37 CFR
 1.104(c)(5)(ii)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322235)**.



# ¶ 7.21.fti Rejection, Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)


Claim **[1]** is/are rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**
 as being unpatentable over **[2]**. 
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This paragraph must be preceded by either form
 paragraph **[7.20.fti](#fp7.20.fti)** or form paragraph **[7.103](#fp7.103)**.
* 2. An explanation of the rejection must follow this form paragraph.
 See **[MPEP §
 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)**.
* 3. If the rejection relies upon prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, use **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** as amended
 by the American Inventors Protection Act to determine the reference’s prior art date,
 unless the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly, or indirectly, from an
 international application which has an international filing date prior to November 29,
 2000. In other words, use **[pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](s2139.html#ch700_d222ef_29c79_2c1)** only if the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly
 or indirectly from either a national stage of an international application (application
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**) which has an international filing date prior to November 29,
 2000 or a continuing application claiming benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313p)**,
 **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040)** or **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)** to an international
 application having an international filing date prior to November 29, 2000. See the
 Examiner Notes for form paragraphs **[7.12.fti](#fp7.12.fti)** and **[7.12.01.fti](#fp7.12.01.fti)** to assist in the
 determination of the reference’s **[35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** date.
* 4. If the applicability of this rejection (e.g., the availability
 of the prior art as a reference under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)**) prevents the reference from being disqualified under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**, form paragraph **[7.20.01.fti](#fp7.20.01.fti)** must follow this form
 paragraph.
* 5. If this rejection is a provisional **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** rejection based upon a copending application that would
 comprise prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** if patented
 or published, use form paragraph **[7.21.01.fti](#fp7.21.01.fti)**  instead of this paragraph.
* 6. In bracket 1, insert the claim numbers which are
 under rejection.
* 7. In bracket 2, insert the prior art relied
 upon.



# ¶ 7.21.01.fti Provisional Rejection, Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a), Common
 Assignee, Common Applicant, or at Least One Common Joint Inventor


Claim **[1]** is/are provisionally rejected under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** as being obvious over copending Application No. **[2]**
 which has a common **[3]** with the instant application. Based upon the earlier
 effective U.S. filing date of the copending application, it would constitute prior art under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** if published or patented. This provisional rejection under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** is based upon a presumption of future publication or patenting of
 the copending application. **[4]**


This provisional rejection might be overcome either by a showing under
 **[37 CFR
 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** that any invention disclosed but not claimed in the copending
 application was derived from the inventor or joint inventors (i.e., the inventive entity) of
 this application and is thus not the invention "by another," or by a showing of a date of
 invention for the instant application prior to the effective U.S. filing date of the copending
 application under **[37 CFR
 1.131(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512)**. This rejection might also be overcome by showing that the
 copending application is disqualified under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** as prior art in a
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**.
 See
 **[MPEP §
 2146](s2146.html#d0e213206)** et seq.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This paragraph is used to provisionally reject claims not
 patentably distinct from the disclosure in a copending application having an earlier
 U.S. filing date and also having either a common assignee, a common applicant
 (**[35 U.S.C.
 118](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302910912)**), or at least one common joint inventor. This form paragraph
 should not be used when the copending application is disqualified under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** as prior art in a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** rejection.
 
 See **[MPEP §
 2146.03(a)](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_12851_21a)**.
* 2. Use **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** as amended
 by the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA) to determine the copending application's
 prior art date, unless the copending application is based directly, or indirectly, from
 an international application which has an international filing date prior to November
 29, 2000. If the copending application is either a national stage of an international
 application (application under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**) which has an
 international filing date prior to November 29, 2000, or a continuing application
 claiming benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313p)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040)**,
 **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)** to an international
 application having an international filing date prior to November 29, 2000, use
 **[pre-AIPA 35
 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-0700.html#ch700_d222ef_29cdb_3ac)** to determine the copending application’s prior art
 date. See the Examiner Notes for form paragraphs **[7.12.fti](#fp7.12.fti)** and
 **[7.12.01.fti](#fp7.12.01.fti)** to assist in the determination of the
 reference’s pre-AIA and pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e) dates, respectively.
* 3. If the claimed invention is fully disclosed in the
 copending application, use paragraph **[7.15.01.fti](#fp7.15.01.fti)**.
* 4. In bracket 1, insert the claim number(s) which
 is/are under rejection.
* 5. In bracket 2, insert the application
 number.
* 6. In bracket 3, insert --assignee--, --applicant--, or
 --joint inventor--.
* 7. In bracket 4, insert an explanation of obviousness.
 See **[MPEP §
 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)**.
* 8. If the claimed invention is not patentably distinct
 from the invention claimed in the copending application, a provisional obviousness
 double patenting rejection should additionally be made using form paragraphs
 **[8.33](#fp8.33)** and
 **[8.37](#fp8.37)**.
* 9. A rejection should additionally be made under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** using form paragraph **[7.21.fti](#fp7.21.fti)** if:
	+ evidence indicates that the copending application is
	 also prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** or
	 **[(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** (e.g., applicant has named the prior inventor in response
	 to a requirement made using form paragraph **[8.28.fti](#fp8.28.fti)**); and
	+ the copending application has not been
	 disqualified as prior art in a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**
	 rejection pursuant to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
	 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**.



# ¶ 7.21.02.fti Rejection, pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a), Common Assignee, Common
 Applicant, or at Least One Common Joint Inventor


Claim **[1]** is/are rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**
 as being obvious over **[2]**.
 


The applied reference has a common **[3]** with the instant
 application. Based upon the earlier effective U.S. filing date of the reference, it
 constitutes prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**. This rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**
 might be overcome by: (1) a showing under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** that any invention disclosed
 but not claimed in the reference was derived from the inventor of this application and is thus
 not an invention "by another"; (2) a showing of a date of invention for the claimed subject
 matter of the application which corresponds to subject matter disclosed but not claimed in the
 reference, prior to the effective U.S. filing date of the reference under **[37 CFR 1.131(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512)**; or
 (3) an oath or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.131(c)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1fc99_2983e_8a)** stating that the
 application and reference are currently owned by the same party and that the inventor or joint
 inventors (i.e., the inventive entity) named in the application is the prior inventor under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_197a5_8)** as in effect on March 15, 2013, together with a terminal disclaimer
 in accordance with **[37 CFR
 1.321(c)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326532)**. This rejection might also be overcome by showing that the
 reference is disqualified under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** as prior art in a
 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)**.
 See
 **[MPEP §
 2146](s2146.html#d0e213206)** et seq. **[4]**


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This paragraph is used to reject over a reference (patent or
 published application) with an earlier filing date that discloses the claimed invention,
 and that only qualifies as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**. If the
 reference qualifies as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)** or
 **[(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e7d_156)**, then this form paragraph should not be used (form paragraph
 **[7.21.fti](#fp7.21.fti)**
 should be used instead). The reference must have either a common assignee, a common
 applicant (**[35
 U.S.C. 118](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302910912)**), or at least one common joint inventor. This form
 paragraph should not be used in applications when the reference is disqualified under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)** as prior art in a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** rejection.
 See
 **[MPEP §
 2146.03](s2146.html#ch2100_d2c184_127cc_34b)**.
* 2. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** as amended
 by the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 (AIPA) must be applied if the reference
 is by another and is one of the following:
	+ a U.S. patent or a publication of a U.S.
	 application for patent filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302678aia)**;
	+ a U.S. patent issued directly or indirectly from,
	 or a U.S. or WIPO publication of, an international application (PCT) if the
	 international application has **an international filing date on or after November
	 29, 2000**;
	+ a U.S. patent issued from, or a WIPO publication of, an
	 international design application that designates the United States.See the Examiner Notes for form paragraph
 **[7.12.fti](#fp7.12.fti)**
 to assist in the determination of the **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** date of the
 reference.
* 3. **[Pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](s2139.html#ch700_d222ef_29c79_2c1)** must be applied if
 the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly, or indirectly, from an international
 application filed prior to November 29, 2000. See the Examiner Notes for form paragraph
 **[7.12.01.fti](#fp7.12.01.fti)** to assist in the determination of the
 **[pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](s2139.html#ch700_d222ef_29c79_2c1)** date of the
 reference.
* 4. In bracket 1, insert the claim number(s) which
 is/are under rejection.
* 5. In bracket 2, insert the prior art reference(s)
 relied upon for the obviousness rejection.
* 6. In bracket 3, insert --assignee--, --applicant--, or
 --joint inventor--.
* 7. In bracket 4, insert an explanation of obviousness.
 See **[MPEP §
 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)**.



# ¶ 7.22.fti Rejection, pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a), Further in View
 Of


Claim **[1]** rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** as being unpatentable over **[2]** as applied to claim
 **[3]** above, and further in view of **[4]**.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form
 paragraph **[7.21.fti](#fp7.21.fti)**.
* 2. An explanation of the rejection must follow this form paragraph.
 See **[MPEP §
 2144](s2144.html#d0e210576)**.
* 3. If the rejection relies upon prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, use **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** as amended
 by the American Inventors Protection Act to determine the reference’s prior art date,
 unless the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly, or indirectly, from an
 international application which has an international filing date prior to November 29,
 2000. In other words, use pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e) only if the reference is a U.S.
 patent issued directly or indirectly from either a national stage of an international
 application (application under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**) which has an
 international filing date prior to November 29, 2000 or a continuing application
 claiming benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**,
 **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)** or **[386(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)** to an international
 application having an international filing date prior to November 29, 2000. See the
 Examiner Notes for form paragraphs **[7.12.fti](#fp7.12.fti)** and **[7.12.01.fti](#fp7.12.01.fti)** to assist in the
 determination of the reference’s **[35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** date.



# ¶ 7.23.fti Test for Obviousness


The factual inquiries for establishing a background for determining
 obviousness under **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** are summarized as follows:
 


* 1. Determining the scope and contents of the prior art.
* 2. Ascertaining the differences between the prior art and the
 claims at issue.
* 3. Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent
 art.
* 4. Considering objective evidence present in the application
 indicating obviousness or nonobviousness.


### Examiner Note:


This form paragraph may be used, if appropriate, in response to an
 argument regarding the applicability of the factors for determining obviousness.
 



# ¶ 7.27.fti Rejection, pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 or pre-AIA 103(a)


Claim(s) **[1]** is/are rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**(**[2]**) as anticipated by or, in the alternative, under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** as obvious over **[3]**. 
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. This form paragraph is NOT intended to be commonly
 used as a substitute for a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. In other
 words, a single rejection under either **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** should be made whenever possible using appropriate form
 paragraphs **[7.15.fti](#fp7.15.fti)** to **[7.19.fti](#fp7.19.fti)**, **[7.21.fti](#fp7.21.fti)** and
 **[7.22.fti](#fp7.22.fti)**.
 Examples of circumstances where this paragraph may be used are as
 follows:
	+ When the interpretation of the claim(s) is or may
	 be in dispute, i.e., given one interpretation, a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
	 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is appropriate and given another interpretation, a
	 rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302455)** is appropriate. See
	 **[MPEP §§
	 2111](s2111.html#d0e200352)** -  **[2116.01](s2116.html#d0e201660)** for guidelines on claim
	 interpretation.
	+ When the reference discloses all the limitations
	 of a claim except a property or function, and the examiner cannot determine whether
	 or not the reference inherently possesses properties which anticipate or render
	 obvious the claimed invention but has basis for shifting the burden of proof to
	 applicant as in *In re Fitzgerald*, 619 F.2d 67, 205 USPQ 594 (CCPA
	 1980). See **[MPEP §§
	 2112](s2112.html#d0e201036)** - **[2112.02](s2112.html#d0e201360)**.
	+ When the reference teaches a small genus which
	 places a claimed species in the possession of the public as in *In re
	 Schaumann*, 572 F.2d 312, 197 USPQ 5 (CCPA 1978), and the species would
	 have been obvious even if the genus were not sufficiently small to justify a
	 rejection under **[35
	 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[MPEP §§ 2131.02](s2131.html#d0e203166)** and
	 **[2144.08](s2144.html#d0e211596)** for more information on anticipation and
	 obviousness of species by a disclosure of a genus.
	+ When the reference teaches a product that appears
	 to be the same as, or an obvious variant of, the product set forth in a
	 product-by-process claim although produced by a different process. See *In re
	 Marosi*, 710 F.2d 799, 218 USPQ 289 (Fed. Cir. 1983) and *In re
	 Thorpe*, 777 F.2d 695, 227 USPQ 964 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See also
	 **[MPEP §
	 2113](s2113.html#d0e201450)**.
	+ When the reference teaches all claim limitations except a
	 means plus function limitation and the examiner is not certain whether the element
	 disclosed in the reference is an equivalent of the claimed element and therefore
	 anticipatory, or whether the prior art element is an obvious variant of the claimed
	 element. See **[MPEP §§
	 2183](s2183.html#d0e220121)** - **[2184](s2184.html#d0e220302)**.
	+ When the ranges disclosed in the reference and
	 claimed by applicant overlap in scope but the reference does not contain a specific
	 example within the claimed range. See the concurring opinion in *Ex parte
	 Lee*, 31 USPQ2d 1105 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993). See
	 **[MPEP §
	 2131.03](s2131.html#d0e203269)**.
* 2. If the interpretation of the claim(s) renders the
 claim(s) indefinite, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, 2nd paragraph, may be appropriate.
* 3. In bracket 1, insert the claim number(s) which is/are
 under rejection.
* 4. In bracket 2, insert the appropriate paragraph
 letter(s) in parenthesis.
* 5. In bracket 3, insert the prior art reference relied upon for the
 rejection.
* 6. A full explanation should follow this form
 paragraph.
* 7. If the rejection relies upon prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**, use **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** as amended
 by the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA) to determine the reference’s prior art
 date, unless the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly, or indirectly, from an
 international application which has an international filing date prior to November 29,
 2000. In other words, use **[pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](s2139.html#ch700_d222ef_29c79_2c1)** only
 if the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly or indirectly from either a national
 stage of an international application (application under **[35 U.S.C. 371](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164)**)
 which has an international filing date prior to November 29, 2000, or a continuing
 application claiming benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** , **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)** or
 **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)** to an international
 application having an international filing date prior to November 29, 2000. See the
 Examiner Notes for form paragraphs **[7.12.fti](#fp7.12.fti)** and **[7.12.01.fti](#fp7.12.01.fti)** to assist in the
 determination of the reference’s pre-AIA and pre-AIPA **[35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)**
 dates, respectively.
* 8. This form paragraph must be preceded by
 **[7.07.fti](#fp7.07.fti)**,
 one or more of form paragraphs **[7.08.fti](#fp7.08.fti)** to **[7.14.fti](#fp7.14.fti)** as appropriate, and form paragraph
 **[7.20.fti](#fp7.20.fti)**
 or by form paragraph **[7.103](#fp7.103)**.
* 9. For applications with an actual filing date on or
 after March 16, 2013, that claim priority to, or the benefit of, an application filed
 before March 16, 2013, this form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph
 **[7.06](#fp7.06)**.
