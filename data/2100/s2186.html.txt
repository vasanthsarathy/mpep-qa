# 2186 Relationship to the Doctrine of Equivalents [R-08.2017]


The doctrine of equivalents arises in the context of an infringement
 action. If an accused product or process does not literally infringe a patented invention,
 the accused product or process may be found to infringe under the doctrine of equivalents.
 The essential objective inquiry is: "Does the accused product or process contain elements
 identical or equivalent to each claimed element of the patented invention?"
 *Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co.,* 520 U.S. 17, 41
 USPQ2d 1865, 1875 (1997). In determining equivalence, "[a]n analysis of the role played by
 each element in the context of the specific patent claim will thus inform the inquiry as to
 whether a substitute element matches the function, way, and result of the claimed element,
 or whether the substitute plays a role substantially different from the claimed element."
 41 USPQ2d at 1875.
 


**[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph,
 permit means- (or step-) plus-function limitations in claims to combinations, "with the
 proviso that application of the broad literal language of such claims must be limited to
 only those means that are ‘equivalent’ to the actual means shown in the patent
 specification. This is an application of the doctrine of equivalents in a restrictive role,
 narrowing the application of broad literal claim elements." 41 USPQ2d at 1870. Accordingly,
 decisions involving the doctrine of equivalents should be considered, but should not unduly
 influence a determination under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph, during *ex parte* examination.
 See **[MPEP §
 2183](s2183.html#d0e220121)**.
