# 2111 Claim Interpretation; Broadest Reasonable Interpretation [R-10.2019]

**CLAIMS MUST BE GIVEN THEIR BROADEST REASONABLE INTERPRETATION IN LIGHT OF THE
 SPECIFICATION**During patent examination, the pending claims must be "given their
 broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification." The Federal
 Circuit’s *en banc* decision in *Phillips v. AWH
 Corp.,* 415 F.3d 1303, 1316, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2005) expressly
 recognized that the USPTO employs the "broadest reasonable interpretation" standard:
 



> 
>  The Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") determines
>  the scope of claims in patent applications not solely on the basis of the claim
>  language, but upon giving claims their broadest reasonable construction "in light of
>  the specification as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art."
>  *In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr.,* 367 F.3d 1359, 1364[, 70
>  USPQ2d 1827, 1830] (Fed. Cir. 2004). Indeed, the rules of the PTO require that
>  application claims must "conform to the invention as set forth in the remainder of
>  the specification and the terms and phrases used in the claims must find clear
>  support or antecedent basis in the description so that the meaning of the terms in
>  the claims may be ascertainable by reference to the description." **[37 CFR

 1259, 94 USPQ2d 1640, 1643 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *In re Hyatt,* 211 F.3d
 1367, 1372, 54 USPQ2d 1664, 1667 (Fed. Cir. 2000). 
 


Patented claims are not given the broadest reasonable
 interpretation during court proceedings involving infringement and validity, and can be
 interpreted based on a fully developed prosecution record. In contrast, an examiner must
 construe claim terms in the broadest reasonable manner during prosecution as is
 reasonably allowed in an effort to establish a clear record of what applicant intends to
 claim. Thus, the Office does not interpret claims when examining patent applications in
 the same manner as the courts. *In re Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44
 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1997); *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319,
 321-22, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1321-22 (Fed. Cir. 1989). 
 


Because applicant has the opportunity to amend the claims
 during prosecution, giving a claim its broadest reasonable interpretation will reduce
 the possibility that the claim, once issued, will be interpreted more broadly than is
 justified.  *In re Yamamoto,* 740 F.2d 1569, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1984);
 *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir.
 1989) ("During patent examination the pending claims must be interpreted as broadly as
 their terms reasonably allow."); *In re Prater,* 415 F.2d 1393,
 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969) (Claim 9 was directed to a process of
 analyzing data generated by mass spectrographic analysis of a gas. The process comprised
 selecting the data to be analyzed by subjecting the data to a mathematical manipulation.
 The examiner made rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. In
 the **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** rejection, the examiner explained that the claim was
 anticipated by a mental process augmented by pencil and paper markings. The court agreed
 that the claim was not limited to using a machine to carry out the process since the
 claim did not explicitly set forth the machine. The court explained that "reading a
 claim in light of the specification, to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited
 in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification
 into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed
 limitations which have no express basis in the claim." The court found that applicant
 was advocating the latter, i.e., the impermissible importation of subject matter from
 the specification into the claim.). See also *In re Morris,* 127 F.3d
 1048, 1054-55, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027-28 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (The court held that the USPTO
 is not required, in the course of prosecution, to interpret claims in applications in
 the same manner as a court would interpret claims in an infringement suit. Rather, the
 "PTO applies to verbiage of the proposed claims the broadest reasonable meaning of the
 words in their ordinary usage as they would be understood by one of ordinary skill in
 the art, taking into account whatever enlightenment by way of definitions or otherwise
 that may be afforded by the written description contained in applicant’s
 specification."). 
 


The broadest reasonable interpretation does not mean the broadest
 possible interpretation. Rather, the meaning given to a claim term must be consistent
 with the ordinary and customary meaning of the term (unless the term has been given a
 special definition in the specification), and must be consistent with the use of the
 claim term in the specification and drawings. Further, the broadest reasonable
 interpretation of the claims must be consistent with the interpretation that those
 skilled in the art would reach. *In re Cortright,* 165 F.3d 1353, 1359,
 49 USPQ2d 1464, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (The Board’s construction of the claim limitation
 "restore hair growth" as requiring the hair to be returned to its original state was
 held to be an incorrect interpretation of the limitation. The court held that,
 consistent with applicant’s disclosure and the disclosure of three patents from
 analogous arts using the same phrase to require only some increase in hair growth, one
 of ordinary skill would construe "restore hair growth" to mean that the claimed method
 increases the amount of hair grown on the scalp, but does not necessarily produce a full
 head of hair.). Thus the focus of the inquiry regarding the meaning of a claim should be
 what would be reasonable from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the
 art. *In re Suitco Surface, Inc.,* 603 F.3d 1255, 1260, 94 USPQ2d
 1640, 1644 (Fed. Cir. 2010); *In re Buszard,* 504 F.3d 1364, 84 USPQ2d
 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In *Buszard,* the claim was directed to a flame
 retardant composition comprising a flexible polyurethane foam reaction mixture. 504 F.3d
 at 1365, 84 USPQ2d at 1750. The Federal Circuit found that the Board’s interpretation
 that equated a "flexible" foam with a crushed "rigid" foam was not reasonable.
 *Id.* at 1367, 84 USPQ2d at 1751. Persuasive argument was presented
 that persons experienced in the field of polyurethane foams know that a flexible mixture
 is different than a rigid foam mixture. *Id.* at 1366, 84 USPQ2d at
 1751.

# 2111.01 Plain Meaning [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the
 relevant date is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the
 "time of the invention," which is only applicable to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*

**I.** **THE WORDS OF A CLAIM MUST BE GIVEN THEIR "PLAIN MEANING" UNLESS SUCH MEANING
 IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SPECIFICATION**Under a broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI),
 words of the claim must be given their plain meaning, unless such meaning is
 inconsistent with the specification. The plain meaning of a term means the ordinary
 and customary meaning given to the term by those of ordinary skill in the art at the
 time of the invention. The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced
 by a variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the
 specification, drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the
 meaning of a claim term is the specification - the greatest clarity is obtained when
 the specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. The words of the claim
 must be given their plain meaning unless the plain meaning is inconsistent with the
 specification. *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320,
 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (discussed below); *Chef America, Inc. v. Lamb-Weston,
 Inc.,* 358 F.3d 1371, 1372, 69 USPQ2d 1857 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Ordinary,
 simple English words whose meaning is clear and unquestionable, absent any indication
 that their use in a particular context changes their meaning, are construed to mean
 exactly what they say. Thus, "heating the resulting batter-coated dough to a
 temperature in the range of about 400oF to
 850oF" required heating the dough, rather than the air
 inside an oven, to the specified temperature.).
 


The presumption that a term is given its ordinary and
 customary meaning may be rebutted by the applicant by clearly setting forth a
 different definition of the term in the specification. *In re
 Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (the
 USPTO looks to the ordinary use of the claim terms taking into account definitions or
 other "enlightenment" contained in the written description); *But c.f. In re
 Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr.,* 367 F.3d 1359, 1369, 70 USPQ2d 1827, 1834
 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("We have cautioned against reading limitations into a claim from
 the preferred embodiment described in the specification, even if it is the only
 embodiment described, absent clear disclaimer in the specification."). When the
 specification sets a clear path to the claim language, the scope of the claims is
 more easily determined and the public notice function of the claims is best served. 
 


**II.** **IT IS IMPROPER TO IMPORT CLAIM LIMITATIONS FROM THE SPECIFICATION**"Though understanding the claim language may be aided by
 explanations contained in the written description, it is important not to import into
 a claim limitations that are not part of the claim. For example, a particular
 embodiment appearing in the written description may not be read into a claim when the
 claim language is broader than the embodiment." *Superguide Corp. v. DirecTV
 Enterprises, Inc.,* 358 F.3d 870, 875, 69 USPQ2d 1865, 1868 (Fed. Cir.
 2004). See also *Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad Inc.,* 358 F.3d 898,
 906, 69 USPQ2d 1801, 1807 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (discussing recent cases wherein the court
 expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single
 embodiment, the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that
 embodiment); *E-Pass Techs., Inc. v. 3Com Corp.,* 343 F.3d 1364,
 1369, 67 USPQ2d 1947, 1950 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("Interpretation of descriptive
 statements in a patent’s written description is a difficult task, as an inherent
 tension exists as to whether a statement is a clear lexicographic definition or a
 description of a preferred embodiment. The problem is to interpret claims ‘in view of
 the specification’ without unnecessarily importing limitations from the specification
 into the claims."); *Altiris Inc. v. Symantec Corp.,* 318 F.3d 1363,
 1371, 65 USPQ2d 1865, 1869-70 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Although the specification discussed
 only a single embodiment, the court held that it was improper to read a specific
 order of steps into method claims where, as a matter of logic or grammar, the
 language of the method claims did not impose a specific order on the performance of
 the method steps, and the specification did not directly or implicitly require a
 particular order). See also subsection IV., below. When an element is claimed using
 language falling under the scope of **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, 6th paragraph (often broadly referred to as
 means- (or step-) plus- function language), the specification must be consulted to
 determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in
 the claim, and the claimed element is construed as limited to the corresponding
 structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.
 *In re Donaldson,* 16 F.3d 1189, 29 USPQ2d 1845 (Fed. Cir. 1994)
 (see **[MPEP
 § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**- **[MPEP § 2186](s2186.html#d0e220631)**).
 


In *Zletz,**supra,* the examiner and the Board had interpreted claims reading
 "normally solid polypropylene" and "normally solid polypropylene having a crystalline
 polypropylene content" as being limited to "normally solid linear high homopolymers
 of propylene which have a crystalline polypropylene content." The court ruled that
 limitations, not present in the claims, were improperly imported from the
 specification. See also *In re Marosi,* 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ
 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("'[C]laims are not to be read in a vacuum, and limitations
 therein are to be interpreted in light of the specification in giving them their
 ‘broadest reasonable interpretation.'" (quoting *In re
 Okuzawa,* 537 F.2d 545, 548, 190 USPQ 464, 466 (CCPA 1976)). The court
 looked to the specification to construe "essentially free of alkali metal" as
 including unavoidable levels of impurities but no more.). 
 

**III.** **"PLAIN MEANING" REFERS TO THE ORDINARY AND CUSTOMARY MEANING GIVEN TO THE TERM
 BY THOSE OF ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART**"[T]he ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning
 that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the
 time of the invention, *i.e*., as of the effective filing date of
 the patent application." *Phillips v. AWH Corp.,*415 F.3d 1303,
 1313, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2005) *(en banc)*;
 *Sunrace Roots Enter. Co. v. SRAM Corp.,* 336 F.3d 1298, 1302, 67
 USPQ2d 1438, 1441 (Fed. Cir. 2003); *Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC v. Intuitive
 Surgical, Inc.,* 334 F.3d 1294, 1298 67 USPQ2d 1132, 1136 (Fed. Cir.
 2003) ("In the absence of an express intent to impart a novel meaning to the claim
 terms, the words are presumed to take on the ordinary and customary meanings
 attributed to them by those of ordinary skill in the art."). 
 


The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced by a
 variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the specification,
 drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the meaning of a
 claim term is the specification – the greatest clarity is obtained when the
 specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. See, e.g., *In re
 Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.,* 696 F.3d 1142, 1149-50, 104 USPQ2d 1337,
 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (construing the term "electrochemical sensor" as "devoid of
 external connection cables or wires to connect to a sensor control unit" to be
 consistent with "the language of the claims and the specification"); *In re
 Suitco Surface, Inc.,* 603 F.3d 1255, 1260-61, 94 USPQ2d 1640, 1644 (Fed.
 Cir. 2010) (construing the term "material for finishing the top surface of the floor"
 to mean "a clear, uniform layer on the top surface of a floor that is the final
 treatment or coating of a surface" to be consistent with "the express language of the
 claim and the specification"); *Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic
 Inc.,* 90 F.3d 1576, 1583, 39 USPQ2d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996)
 (construing the term "solder reflow temperature" to mean "peak reflow temperature" of
 solder rather than the "liquidus temperature" of solder in order to remain consistent
 with the specification). 
 


It is also appropriate to look to how the claim term is
 used in the prior art, which includes prior art patents, published applications,
 trade publications, and dictionaries. Any meaning of a claim term taken from the
 prior art must be consistent with the use of the claim term in the specification and
 drawings. Moreover , when the specification is clear about the scope and content of a
 claim term, there is no need to turn to extrinsic evidence for claim interpretation.
 *3M Innovative Props. Co. v. Tredegar Corp.,* 725 F.3d 1315,
 1326-28, 107 USPQ2d 1717, 1726-27 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that "continuous
 microtextured skin layer over substantially the entire laminate" was clearly defined
 in the written description, and therefore, there was no need to turn to extrinsic
 evidence to construe the claim).
 

**IV.** **APPLICANT MAY BE OWN LEXICOGRAPHER AND/OR MAY DISAVOW CLAIM SCOPE**The only exceptions to giving the words in a claim
 their ordinary and customary meaning in the art are (1) when the applicant acts as
 their own lexicographer; and (2) when the applicant disavows or disclaims the full
 scope of a claim term in the specification. To act as their own lexicographer, the
 applicant must clearly set forth a special definition of a claim term in the
 specification that differs from the plain and ordinary meaning it would otherwise
 possess. The specification may also include an intentional disclaimer, or disavowal,
 of claim scope. In both of these cases, "the inventor’s intention, as expressed in
 the specification, is regarded as dispositive." *Phillips v. AWH
 Corp.,* 415 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc). See also
 *Starhome GmbH v. AT&T Mobility LLC,* 743 F.3d 849, 857, 109
 USPQ2d 1885, 1890-91 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that the term "gateway" should be
 given its ordinary and customary meaning of "a connection between different networks"
 because nothing in the specification indicated a clear intent to depart from that
 ordinary meaning); *Thorner v. Sony Computer Entm’t Am. LLC,* 669
 F.3d 1362, 1367-68, 101 USPQ2d 1457, 1460 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (The asserted claims of
 the patent were directed to a tactile feedback system for video game controllers
 comprising a flexible pad with a plurality of actuators "attached to said pad." The
 court held that the claims were not limited to actuators attached to the external
 surface of the pad, even though the specification used the word "attached" when
 describing embodiments affixed to the external surface of the pad but the word
 "embedded" when describing embodiments affixed to the internal surface of the pad.
 The court explained that the plain and ordinary meaning of "attached" includes both
 external and internal attachments. Further, there is no clear and explicit statement
 in the specification to redefine "attached" or disavow the full scope of the term.). 
 

***A.******Lexicography***An applicant is entitled to be their own lexicographer and may
 rebut the presumption that claim terms are to be given their ordinary and
 customary meaning by clearly setting forth a definition of the term that is
 different from its ordinary and customary meaning(s) in the specification at the
 time of filing. See *In re Paulsen,* 30 F.3d 1475, 1480,
 31 USPQ2d 1671, 1674 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that an inventor may define
 specific terms used to describe invention, but must do so "with reasonable
 clarity, deliberateness, and precision" and, if done, must "‘set out his uncommon
 definition in some manner within the patent disclosure’ so as to give one of
 ordinary skill in the art notice of the change" in meaning) (quoting
 *Intellicall, Inc. v. Phonometrics, Inc.,* 952 F.2d 1384,
 1387-88, 21 USPQ2d 1383, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). 
 


Where an explicit definition is provided by the
 applicant for a term, that definition will control interpretation of the term as
 it is used in the claim. *Toro Co. v. White Consolidated Industries
 Inc.,* 199 F.3d 1295, 1301, 53 USPQ2d 1065, 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1999)
 (meaning of words used in a claim is not construed in a "lexicographic vacuum, but
 in the context of the specification and drawings"). Thus, if a claim term is used
 in its ordinary and customary meaning throughout the specification, and the
 written description clearly indicates its meaning, then the term in the claim has
 that meaning. *Old Town Canoe Co. v. Confluence Holdings Corp.,*
 448 F.3d 1309, 1317, 78 USPQ2d 1705, 1711 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (The court held that
 "completion of coalescence" must be given its ordinary and customary meaning of
 reaching the end of coalescence. The court explained that even though coalescence
 could theoretically be "completed" by halting the molding process earlier, the
 specification clearly intended that completion of coalescence occurs only after
 the molding process reaches its optimum stage.).
 


However, it is important to note that any special
 meaning assigned to a term "must be sufficiently clear in the specification that
 any departure from common usage would be so understood by a person of experience
 in the field of the invention." *Multiform Desiccants Inc. v. Medzam
 Ltd.,* 133 F.3d 1473, 1477, 45 USPQ2d 1429, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1998). See
 also *Process Control Corp. v. HydReclaim Corp.,* 190 F.3d 1350,
 1357, 52 USPQ2d 1029, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1999) and **[MPEP
 § 2173.05(a)](s2173.html#d0e217839)**. 
 


In some cases, the meaning of a particular claim
 term may be defined by implication, that is, according to the usage of the term in
 the context in the specification. See *Phillips v. AWH Corp.,*
 415 F.3d 1303, 1320-21, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2005) *(en
 banc)*; *Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic Inc.,* 90
 F.3d 1576, 1583, 39 USPQ2d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996). But where the
 specification is ambiguous as to whether the inventor used claim terms
 inconsistent with their ordinary meaning, the ordinary meaning will apply.
 *Merck & Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc.,* 395 F.3d 1364,
 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (The Federal Circuit reversed the district court’s
 construction of the claim term "about" as "exactly." The appellate court explained
 that a passage in the specification the district court relied upon for the
 definition of "about" was too ambiguous to redefine "about" to mean "exactly" in
 clear enough terms. The appellate court held that "about" should instead be given
 its plain and ordinary meaning of "approximately.").
 

***B.******Disavowal***Applicant may also rebut the presumption of plain
 meaning by clearly disavowing the full scope of the claim term in the
 specification. Disavowal, or disclaimer of claim scope, is only considered when it
 is clear and unmistakable. See *SciMed Life Sys., Inc. v. Advanced
 Cardiovascular Sys., Inc.,* 242 F.3d 1337, 1341, 58 USPQ2d 1059, 1063
 (Fed.Cir.2001) ("Where the specification makes clear that the invention does not
 include a particular feature, that feature is deemed to be outside the reach of
 the claims of the patent, even though the language of the claims, read without
 reference to the specification, might be considered broad enough to encompass the
 feature in question."); see also *In re Am. Acad. Of Sci. Tech
 Ctr.,* 367 F.3d 1359, 1365-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (refusing to limit
 claim term "user computer" to only "single-user computers" even though "some of
 the language of the specification, when viewed in isolation, might lead a reader
 to conclude that the term . . . is meant to refer to a computer that serves only a
 single user, the specification as a whole suggests a construction that is not so
 narrow"). But, in some cases, disavowal of a broader claim scope may be made by
 implication, such as where the specification contains only disparaging remarks
 with respect to a feature and every embodiment in the specification excludes that
 feature. *In re Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.,* 696 F.3d 1142,
 1149-50, 104 USPQ2d 1337, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding that the broadest
 reasonable interpretation of the claim term "electrochemical sensor" does not
 include a sensor having "external connection cables or wires" because the
 specification "repeatedly, consistently, and exclusively depict[s] an
 electrochemical sensor without external cables or wires while simultaneously
 disparaging sensors with external cables or wires"). If the examiner believes that
 the broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim is narrower than what the words
 of the claim otherwise suggest as the result of implicit disavowal in the
 specification, then the examiner should make the interpretation clear on the
 record.

**V.** **SUMMARY OF DETERMINING THE MEANING OF A CLAIM TERM THAT DOES NOT INVOKE 35
 U.S.C. 112(f)**This flow chart indicates the decisions an examiner
 would follow in order to ascertain the proper claim interpretation based on the plain
 meaning definition of BRI. With each decision in the flow chart, a different path may
 need to be taken to conclude whether plain meaning applies or a special definition
 applies.
 


The first question is to determine whether a claim
 term has an ordinary and customary meaning to those of ordinary skill in the art. If
 so, then the examiner should check the specification to determine whether it provides
 a special definition for the claim term. If the specification does not provide a
 special definition for the claim term, the examiner should apply the ordinary and
 customary meaning to the claim term. If the specification provides a special
 definition for the claim term, the examiner should use the special definition.
 However, because there is a presumption that claim terms have their ordinary and
 customary meaning and the specification must provide a clear and intentional use of a
 special definition for the claim term to be treated as having a special definition,
 an Office action should acknowledge and identify the special definition in this
 situation.
 


Moving back to the first question, if a claim term
 does not have an ordinary and customary meaning, the examiner should check the
 specification to determine whether it provides a meaning to the claim term. If no
 reasonably clear meaning can be ascribed to the claim term after considering the
 specification and prior art, the examiner should apply the broadest reasonable
 interpretation to the claim term as it can be best understood. Also, the claim should
 be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** and the
 specification objected to under **[37 CFR 1.75(d)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320295)**.
 


If the specification provides a meaning for the claim
 term, the examiner should use the meaning provided by the specification. It may be
 appropriate for an Office action to acknowledge and identify the special definition
 in this situation.

# 2111.02 Effect of Preamble [R-10.2019]


The determination of whether a preamble limits a claim is made on a
 case-by-case basis in light of the facts in each case; there is no litmus test defining
 when a preamble limits the scope of a claim. *Catalina Mktg. Int’l v.
 Coolsavings.com, Inc.,* 289 F.3d 801, 808, 62 USPQ2d 1781, 1785 (Fed. Cir.
 2002). See *id.* at 808-10, 62 USPQ2d at 1784-86 for a discussion of
 guideposts that have emerged from various decisions exploring the preamble’s effect on
 claim scope, as well as a hypothetical example illustrating these principles. 
 


 "[A] claim preamble has the import that the claim as a whole suggests
 for it." *Bell Communications Research, Inc. v. Vitalink Communications
 Corp.,* 55 F.3d 615, 620, 34 USPQ2d 1816, 1820 (Fed. Cir. 1995). "If the
 claim preamble, when read in the context of the entire claim, recites limitations of the
 claim, or, if the claim preamble is ‘necessary to give life, meaning, and vitality’ to
 the claim, then the claim preamble should be construed as if in the balance of the
 claim." *Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,* 182 F.3d 1298,
 1305, 51 USPQ2d 1161, 1165-66 (Fed. Cir. 1999). See also *Jansen v. Rexall
 Sundown, Inc.,* 342 F.3d 1329, 1333, 68 USPQ2d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2003)
 (In considering the effect of the preamble in a claim directed to a method of treating
 or preventing pernicious anemia in humans by administering a certain vitamin preparation
 to "a human in need thereof," the court held that the claims’ recitation of a patient or
 a human "in need" gives life and meaning to the preamble’s statement of
 purpose.). *Kropa v. Robie,* 187 F.2d 150, 152, 88 USPQ 478, 481
 (CCPA 1951) (A preamble reciting "[a]n abrasive article" was deemed essential to point
 out the invention defined by claims to an article comprising abrasive grains and a
 hardened binder and the process of making it. The court stated "it is only by that
 phrase that it can be known that the subject matter defined by the claims is comprised
 as an abrasive article. Every union of substances capable *inter alia*
 of use as abrasive grains and a binder is not an ‘abrasive article.’" Therefore, the
 preamble served to further define the structure of the article produced.). 
 

**I.** **PREAMBLE STATEMENTS LIMITING STRUCTURE** Any terminology in the preamble that limits the structure of the
 claimed invention must be treated as a claim limitation. See, e.g., *Corning
 Glass Works v. Sumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc.,* 868 F.2d 1251, 1257,
 9 USPQ2d 1962, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (The determination of whether preamble
 recitations are structural limitations can be resolved only on review of the entirety
 of the application "to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented
 and intended to encompass by the claim" as drafted without importing "'extraneous'
 limitations from the specification."); *Pac-Tec Inc. v. Amerace
 Corp.,* 903 F.2d 796, 801, 14 USPQ2d 1871, 1876 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
 (determining that preamble language that constitutes a structural limitation is
 actually part of the claimed invention). See also *In re Stencel,*
 828 F.2d 751, 4 USPQ2d 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (The claim at issue was directed to a
 driver for setting a joint of a threaded collar; however, the body of the claim did
 not directly include the structure of the collar as part of the claimed article. The
 examiner did not consider the preamble, which did set forth the structure of the
 collar, as limiting the claim. The court found that the collar structure could not be
 ignored. While the claim was not directly limited to the collar, the collar structure
 recited in the preamble did limit the structure of the driver. "[T]he framework - the
 teachings of the prior art - against which patentability is measured is not all
 drivers broadly, but drivers suitable for use in combination with this collar, for
 the claims are so limited." *Id.* at 1073, 828 F.2d at 754.).
 

**II.** **PREAMBLE STATEMENTS RECITING PURPOSE OR INTENDED USE**The claim preamble must be read in the context of the entire claim.
 The determination of whether preamble recitations are structural limitations or mere
 statements of purpose or use "can be resolved only on review of the entirety of the
 [record] to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and
 intended to encompass by the claim" as drafted without importing "'extraneous'
 limitations from the specification." *Corning Glass Works,* 868 F.2d
 at 1257, 9 USPQ2d at 1966. If the body of a claim fully and intrinsically sets forth
 all of the limitations of the claimed invention, and the preamble merely states, for
 example, the purpose or intended use of the invention, rather than any distinct
 definition of any of the claimed invention’s limitations, then the preamble is not
 considered a limitation and is of no significance to claim construction.
 *Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,* 182 F.3d 1298, 1305,
 51 USPQ2d 1161, 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1999). See also *Rowe v. Dror,* 112
 F.3d 473, 478, 42 USPQ2d 1550, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("where a patentee defines a
 structurally complete invention in the claim body and uses the preamble only to state
 a purpose or intended use for the invention, the preamble is not a claim
 limitation"); *Kropa v. Robie,* 187 F.2d at 152, 88 USPQ2d at 480-81
 (preamble is not a limitation where claim is directed to a product and the preamble
 merely recites a property inherent in an old product defined by the remainder of the
 claim); *STX LLC. v. Brine,* 211 F.3d 588, 591, 54 USPQ2d 1347, 1350
 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the preamble phrase "which provides improved playing
 and handling characteristics" in a claim drawn to a head for a lacrosse stick was not
 a claim limitation). Compare *Jansen v. Rexall Sundown, Inc.,* 342
 F.3d 1329, 1333-34, 68 USPQ2d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (In a claim directed to a
 method of treating or preventing pernicious anemia in humans by administering a
 certain vitamin preparation to "a human in need thereof," the court held that the
 preamble is not merely a statement of effect that may or may not be desired or
 appreciated, but rather is a statement of the intentional purpose for which the
 method must be performed. Thus the claim is properly interpreted to mean that the
 vitamin preparation must be administered to a human with a recognized need to treat
 or prevent pernicious anemia.); *Nantkwest , Inc. v. Lee,* 686 Fed.
 App'x 864, 867 (Fed. Cir. 2017)(nonprecedential) (The court found that the preamble
 phrase "treating a cancer" "’require[s] lysis of many cells, in order to accomplish
 the goal of treating cancer’ and not merely lysing one or a few cancer cells.");
  *In re Cruciferous Sprout Litig.,* 301 F.3d 1343, 1346-48, 64
 USPQ2d 1202, 1204-05 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (A claim at issue was directed to a method of
 preparing a food rich in glucosinolates wherein cruciferous sprouts are harvested
 prior to the 2-leaf stage. The court held that the preamble phrase "rich in
 glucosinolates" helps define the claimed invention, as evidenced by the specification
 and prosecution history, and thus is a limitation of the claim (although the claim
 was anticipated by prior art that produced sprouts inherently "rich in
 glucosinolates")).
 


During examination, statements in the preamble reciting the purpose
 or intended use of the claimed invention must be evaluated to determine whether or
 not the recited purpose or intended use results in a structural difference (or, in
 the case of process claims, manipulative difference) between the claimed invention
 and the prior art. If so, the recitation serves to limit the claim. See, e.g.,
 *In re Otto,* 312 F.2d 937, 938, 136 USPQ 458, 459 (CCPA 1963)
 (The claims were directed to a core member for hair curlers and a process of making a
 core member for hair curlers. The court held that the intended use of hair curling
 was of no significance to the structure and process of making.); *In re
 Sinex,* 309 F.2d 488, 492, 135 USPQ 302, 305 (CCPA 1962) (statement of
 intended use in an apparatus claim did not distinguish over the prior art apparatus).
 To satisfy an intended use limitation which is limiting, a prior art structure which
 is capable of performing the intended use as recited in the preamble meets the claim.
 See, e.g., *In re Schreiber,* 128 F.3d 1473, 1477, 44 USPQ2d 1429,
 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (anticipation rejection affirmed based on Board’s factual
 finding that the reference dispenser (a spout disclosed as useful for purposes such
 as dispensing oil from an oil can) would be capable of dispensing popcorn in the
 manner set forth in appellant’s claim 1 (a dispensing top for dispensing popcorn in a
 specified manner)) and cases cited therein. See also **[MPEP § 2112](s2112.html#d0e201036)** -
 **[MPEP §
 2112.02](s2112.html#d0e201360)**. 
 


However, a "preamble may provide context for claim construction,
 particularly, where … that preamble’s statement of intended use forms the basis for
 distinguishing the prior art in the patent’s prosecution history."
 *Metabolite Labs., Inc. v. Corp. of Am. Holdings,* 370 F.3d 1354,
 1358-62, 71 USPQ2d 1081, 1084-87 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The patent claim at issue was
 directed to a two-step method for detecting a deficiency of vitamin
 B12 or folic acid, involving (i) assaying a body fluid for
 an "elevated level" of homocysteine, and (ii) "correlating" an "elevated" level with
 a vitamin deficiency. *Id.* at 1358-59, 71 USPQ2d at 1084. The court
 stated that the disputed claim term "correlating" can include comparing with either
 an unelevated level or elevated level, as opposed to only an elevated level because
 adding the "correlating" step in the claim during prosecution to overcome prior art
 tied the preamble directly to the "correlating" step. *Id.* at 1362,
 71 USPQ2d at 1087. The recitation of the intended use of "detecting" a vitamin
 deficiency in the preamble rendered the claimed invention a method for "detecting,"
 and, thus, was not limited to detecting "elevated" levels. *Id.*


See also *Catalina Mktg. Int’l,* 289 F.3d at
 808-09, 62 USPQ2d at 1785 ("[C]lear reliance on the preamble during prosecution to
 distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art transforms the preamble into a
 claim limitation because such reliance indicates use of the preamble to define, in
 part, the claimed invention.…Without such reliance, however, a preamble generally is
 not limiting when the claim body describes a structurally complete invention such
 that deletion of the preamble phrase does not affect the structure or steps of the
 claimed invention." Consequently, "preamble language merely extolling benefits or
 features of the claimed invention does not limit the claim scope without clear
 reliance on those benefits or features as patentably significant."). In
 *Poly-America LP v. GSE Lining Tech. Inc.,* 383 F.3d 1303, 1310,
 72 USPQ2d 1685, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court stated that "a ‘[r]eview of the
 entirety of the ’047 patent reveals that the preamble language relating to
 ‘blown-film’ does not state a purpose or an intended use of the invention, but rather
 discloses a fundamental characteristic of the claimed invention that is properly
 construed as a limitation of the claim.’" Compare *Intirtool, Ltd. v. Texar
 Corp.,* 369 F.3d 1289, 1294-96, 70 USPQ2d 1780, 1783-84 (Fed. Cir. 2004)
 (holding that the preamble of a patent claim directed to a "hand-held punch pliers
 for simultaneously punching and connecting overlapping sheet metal" was not a
 limitation of the claim because (i) the body of the claim described a "structurally
 complete invention" without the preamble, and (ii) statements in prosecution history
 referring to "punching and connecting" function of invention did not constitute
 "clear reliance" on the preamble needed to make the preamble a limitation).
 




# 2111.03 Transitional Phrases [R-08.2017]


The transitional phrases "comprising", "consisting essentially of" and
 "consisting of" define the scope of a claim with respect to what unrecited additional
 components or steps, if any, are excluded from the scope of the claim. The determination
 of what is or is not excluded by a transitional phrase must be made on a case-by-case
 basis in light of the facts of each case. 
 

**I.** **COMPRISING**The transitional term "comprising", which is synonymous with
 "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-ended and does
 not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. See, e.g., *Mars
 Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co.,* 377 F.3d 1369, 1376, 71 USPQ2d 1837, 1843 (Fed.
 Cir. 2004) ("[L]ike the term ‘comprising,’ the terms ‘containing’ and ‘mixture’ are
 open-ended."). *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing, L.P.,*
 327 F.3d 1364, 1368, 66 USPQ2d 1631, 1634 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("The transition
 ‘comprising’ in a method claim indicates that the claim is open-ended and allows for
 additional steps."); *Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron Corp.,* 112 F.3d
 495, 501, 42 USPQ2d 1608, 1613 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("Comprising" is a term of art used
 in claim language which means that the named elements are essential, but other
 elements may be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim.);
 *Moleculon Research Corp.**v.**CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 229 USPQ 805 (Fed. Cir. 1986);
 *In re Baxter,* 656 F.2d 679, 686, 210 USPQ 795, 803 (CCPA 1981);
 *Ex parte Davis,* 80 USPQ 448, 450 (Bd. App. 1948) ("comprising"
 leaves "the claim open for the inclusion of unspecified ingredients even in major
 amounts"). In *Gillette Co. v. Energizer Holdings Inc.,* 405 F.3d
 1367, 1371-73, 74 USPQ2d 1586, 1589-91 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court held that a claim
 to "a safety razor blade unit comprising a guard, a cap, and a group of first,
 second, and third blades" encompasses razors with more than three blades because the
 transitional phrase "comprising" in the preamble and the phrase "group of" are
 presumptively open-ended. "The word ‘comprising’ transitioning from the preamble to
 the body signals that the entire claim is presumptively open-ended."
 *Id.* In contrast, the court noted the phrase "group consisting
 of" is a closed term, which is often used in claim drafting to signal a "Markush
 group" that is by its nature closed. *Id.* The court also emphasized
 that reference to "first," "second," and "third" blades in the claim was not used to
 show a serial or numerical limitation but instead was used to distinguish or identify
 the various members of the group. *Id.*

**II.** **CONSISTING OF**The transitional phrase "consisting of" excludes any element, step,
 or ingredient not specified in the claim. *In re Gray,* 53 F.2d 520,
 11 USPQ 255 (CCPA 1931); *Ex parte Davis,* 80 USPQ 448, 450 (Bd.
 App. 1948) ("consisting of" defined as "closing the claim to the inclusion of
 materials other than those recited except for impurities ordinarily associated
 therewith"). But see *Norian Corp. v. Stryker Corp.,* 363 F.3d 1321,
 1331-32, 70 USPQ2d 1508, 1516 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (holding that a bone repair kit
 
 "consisting of"
 
 
 claimed
 chemicals was infringed by a bone repair kit including a spatula in addition to the
 claimed chemicals because the presence of the spatula was unrelated to the claimed
 invention). A claim which depends from a claim which "consists of" the recited
 elements or steps cannot add an element or step. 
 


When the phrase "consists of" appears in a clause of
 the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, there is an
 "exceptionally strong presumption that a claim term set off with ‘consisting of’ is
 closed to unrecited elements." *Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc.
 v. Berry Plastics Corp.,* 831 F.3d 1350, 1359, 119 USPQ2d 1773, 1781
 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (a layer "selected from the group consisting of" specific resins is
 closed to resins other than those listed). However, the "consisting of" phrase limits
 only the element set forth in that clause; other elements are not excluded from the
 claim as a whole. *Mannesmann Demag Corp.**v.**Engineered Metal Products Co.,* 793 F.2d 1279, 230 USPQ 45 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986). See also *In re Crish,* 393 F.3d 1253, 73 USPQ2d 1364
 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (The claims at issue "related to purified DNA molecules having
 promoter activity for the human involucrin gene (hINV)." *Id.,* 73
 USPQ2d at 1365. In determining the scope of applicant’s claims directed to "a
 purified oligonucleotide comprising at least a portion of the
 nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 wherein said portion consists
 of the nucleotide sequence from … to 2473 of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein
 said portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 has promoter activity," the
 court stated that the use of "consists" in the body of the claims did not limit the
 open-ended "comprising" language in the claims (emphases added).
 *Id.* at 1257, 73 USPQ2d at 1367. The court held that the claimed
 promoter sequence designated as SEQ ID NO:1 was obtained by sequencing the same prior
 art plasmid and was therefore anticipated by the prior art plasmid which necessarily
 possessed the same DNA sequence as the claimed oligonucleotides.
 *Id.* at 1256 and 1259, 73 USPQ2d at 1366 and 1369. The court
 affirmed the Board’s interpretation that the transition phrase "consists" did not
 limit the claims to only the recited numbered nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO:1 and
 that "the transition language ‘comprising’ allowed the claims to cover the entire
 involucrin gene plus other portions of the plasmid, as long as the gene contained the
 specific portions of SEQ ID NO:1 recited by the claim[s]." *Id.* at
 1256, 73 USPQ2d at 1366.).
 


A claim element defined by selection from a group of
 alternatives (a Markush grouping; see **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)** and **[§ 2173.05(h)](s2173.html#d0e218467)**) requires selection
 from a closed group "consisting of" (rather than "comprising" or "including") the
 alternative members. *Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Pharmaceutical Products
 Inc.,* 334 F.3d 1274, 1280, 67 USPQ2d 1191, 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2003). If
 the claim element is intended to encompass combinations or mixtures of the
 alternatives set forth in the Markush grouping, the claim may include qualifying
 language preceding the recited alternatives (such as "at least one member" selected
 from the group), or within the list of alternatives (such as "or mixtures thereof").
 *Id.* In the absence of such qualifying language there is a
 presumption that the Markush group is closed to combinations or mixtures. See
 *Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc. v. Berry Plastics
 Corp.,* 831 F.3d 1350, 1363-64, 119 USPQ2d 1773, 1784-85 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
 (presumption that Markush grouping does not encompass mixtures of listed resins
 overcome by intrinsic evidence in a dependent claim and the specification).
 

**III.** **CONSISTING ESSENTIALLY
 OF**The transitional phrase "consisting essentially of" limits the scope
 of a claim to the specified materials or steps "and those that do not
 materially affect the basic and
 novel characteristic(s)" of the claimed invention.
 *In re Herz,* 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976)
 (emphasis in original) (Prior art hydraulic fluid required a dispersant which
 appellants argued was excluded from claims limited to a functional fluid "consisting
 essentially of" certain components. In finding the claims did not exclude the prior
 art dispersant, the court noted that appellants’ specification indicated the claimed
 composition can contain any well-known additive such as a dispersant, and there was
 no evidence that the presence of a dispersant would materially affect the basic and
 novel characteristic of the claimed invention. The prior art composition had the same
 basic and novel characteristic (increased oxidation resistance) as well as additional
 enhanced detergent and dispersant characteristics.). "A ‘consisting essentially of’
 claim occupies a middle ground between closed claims that are written in a
 ‘consisting of’ format and fully open claims that are drafted in a ‘comprising’
 format." *PPG Industries v. Guardian Industries,* 156 F.3d 1351,
 1354, 48 USPQ2d 1351, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 1998). See also *Atlas Powder v.
 E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co.,* 750 F.2d 1569, 224 USPQ 409 (Fed. Cir.
 1984); *In re Janakirama-Rao,* 317 F.2d 951, 137 USPQ 893 (CCPA
 1963); *Water Technologies Corp. vs. Calco, Ltd.,* 850 F.2d 660, 7
 USPQ2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1988). For the purposes of searching for and applying prior
 art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, absent a clear indication in
 the specification or claims of what the basic and novel characteristics actually are,
 "consisting essentially of" will be construed as equivalent to "comprising." See,
 e.g., *PPG,* 156 F.3d at 1355, 48 USPQ2d at 1355 ("PPG could have
 defined the scope of the phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ for purposes of its
 patent by making clear in its specification what it regarded as constituting a
 material change in the basic and novel characteristics of the invention."). See also
 *AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac,* 344 F.3d 1234, 1240-41, 68 USPQ2d
 1280, 1283-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Applicant’s statement in the specification that
 "silicon contents in the coating metal should not exceed about 0.5% by weight" along
 with a discussion of the deleterious effects of silicon provided basis to conclude
 that silicon in excess of 0.5% by weight would materially alter the basic and
 novel properties of the invention. Thus, "consisting essentially of" as recited in
 the preamble was interpreted to permit no more than 0.5% by weight of silicon in the
 aluminum coating.); *In re Janakirama-Rao,* 317 F.2d 951, 954, 137
 USPQ 893, 895-96 (CCPA 1963). If an applicant contends that additional steps or
 materials in the prior art are excluded by the recitation of "consisting essentially
 of," applicant has the burden of showing that the introduction of additional steps or
 components would materially change the characteristics of applicant’s invention.
 *In re De Lajarte,* 337 F.2d 870, 143 USPQ 256 (CCPA 1964). See
 also *Ex parte Hoffman,* 12 USPQ2d 1061, 1063-64 (Bd. Pat. App.
 & Inter. 1989) ("Although ‘consisting essentially of’ is typically used and
 defined in the context of compositions of matter, we find nothing intrinsically wrong
 with the use of such language as a modifier of method steps. . . [rendering] the
 claim open only for the inclusion of steps which do not materially affect the basic
 and novel characteristics of the claimed method. To determine the steps included
 versus excluded the claim must be read in light of the specification. . . . [I]t is
 an applicant’s burden to establish that a step practiced in a prior art method is
 excluded from his claims by ‘consisting essentially of’ language."). 
 

**IV.** **OTHER TRANSITIONAL PHRASES**Transitional phrases such as "having" must be interpreted in light
 of the specification to determine whether open or closed claim language is intended.
 See, e.g., *Lampi Corp. v. American Power Products Inc.,* 228 F.3d
 1365, 1376, 56 USPQ2d 1445, 1453 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (interpreting the term "having" as
 open terminology, allowing the inclusion of other components in addition to those
 recited); *Crystal Semiconductor Corp. v. TriTech Microelectronics Int’l
 Inc.,* 246 F.3d 1336, 1348, 57 USPQ2d 1953, 1959 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (term
 "having" in transitional phrase "does not create a presumption that the body of the
 claim is open"); *Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly &
 Co.,* 119 F.3d 1559, 1573, 43 USPQ2d 1398, 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (in the
 context of a cDNA having a sequence coding for human PI, the term "having" still
 permitted inclusion of other moieties). The transitional phrase "composed of" has
 been interpreted in the same manner as either "consisting of" or "consisting
 essentially of," depending on the facts of the particular case. See *AFG
 Industries, Inc. v. Cardinal IG Company,* 239 F.3d 1239, 1245, 57 USPQ2d
 1776, 1780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (based on specification and other evidence, "composed
 of" interpreted in same manner as "consisting essentially of"); *In re
 Bertsch,* 132 F.2d 1014, 1019-20, 56 USPQ 379, 384 (CCPA 1942) ("Composed
 of" interpreted in same manner as "consisting of"; however, the court further
 remarked that "the words ‘composed of’ may under certain circumstances be given, in
 patent law, a broader meaning than ‘consisting of.’"). 
 




# 2111.04 "Adapted to," "Adapted for," "Wherein," "Whereby," and
 Contingent Clauses [R-10.2019]

**I.** **"ADAPTED TO," "ADAPTED FOR,"
 "WHEREIN," and "WHEREBY"**Claim scope is not limited by claim language that suggests or makes
 optional but does not require steps to be performed, or by claim language that does
 not limit a claim to a particular structure. However, examples of claim language,
 although not exhaustive, that may raise a question as to the limiting effect of the
 language in a claim are:
 


* (A) "adapted to" or "adapted for" clauses;
* (B) "wherein" clauses; and
* (C) "whereby" clauses.


The determination of whether each of these clauses is a limitation
 in a claim depends on the specific facts of the case. See, e.g., *Griffin v.
 Bertina,* 285 F.3d 1029, 1034, 62 USPQ2d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (finding
 that a "wherein" clause limited a process claim where the clause gave "meaning and
 purpose to the manipulative steps"). In *In re Giannelli,* 739 F.3d
 1375, 1378, 109 USPQ2d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the court found that an "adapted
 to" clause limited a machine claim where "the written description makes clear that
 'adapted to,' as used in the [patent] application, has a narrower meaning, viz., that
 the claimed machine is designed or constructed to be used as a rowing machine whereby
 a pulling force is exerted on the handles." In *Hoffer v. Microsoft
 Corp.,* 405 F.3d 1326, 1329, 74 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the
 court held that when a "‘whereby’ clause states a condition that is material to
 patentability, it cannot be ignored in order to change the substance of the
 invention." *Id.* However, the court noted that a "‘whereby clause
 in a method claim is not given weight when it simply expresses the intended result of
 a process step positively recited.’" *Id.* (quoting *Minton
 v. Nat’l Ass’n of Securities Dealers, Inc.,* 336 F.3d 1373, 1381, 67
 USPQ2d 1614, 1620 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).
 

**II.** **CONTINGENT
 LIMITATIONS** The broadest reasonable interpretation of a method
 (or process) claim having contingent limitations requires only those steps that must
 be performed and does not include steps that are not required to be performed because
 the condition(s) precedent are not met. For example, assume a method claim requires
 step A if a first condition happens and step B if a second condition happens. If the
 claimed invention may be practiced without either the first or second condition
 happening, then neither step A or B is required by the broadest reasonable
 interpretation of the claim. If the claimed invention requires the first condition to
 occur, then the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim requires step A. If
 the claimed invention requires both the first and second conditions to occur, then
 the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim requires both steps A and B. 
 


 The broadest reasonable interpretation of a system
 (or apparatus or product) claim having structure that performs a function, which only
 needs to occur if a condition precedent is met, requires structure for performing the
 function should the condition occur. The system claim interpretation differs from a
 method claim interpretation because the claimed structure must be present in the
 system regardless of whether the condition is met and the function is actually
 performed. 
 


 See *Ex parte Schulhauser,* Appeal
 2013-007847 (PTAB April 28, 2016) for an analysis of contingent claim limitations in
 the context of both method claims and system claims. In
 *Schulhauser,* both method claims and system claims recited the
 same contingent step. When analyzing the claimed method as a whole, the PTAB
 determined that giving the claim its broadest reasonable interpretation, "[i]f the
 condition for performing a contingent step is not satisfied, the performance recited
 by the step need not be carried out in order for the claimed method to be performed"
 (quotation omitted). *Schulhauser* at 10. When analyzing the claimed
 system as a whole, the PTAB determined that "[t]he broadest reasonable interpretation
 of a system claim having structure that performs a function, which only needs to
 occur if a condition precedent is met, still requires structure for performing the
 function should the condition occur." *Schulhauser* at 14. Therefore
 "[t]he Examiner did not need to present evidence of the obviousness of the [ ] method
 steps of claim 1 that are not required to be performed under a broadest reasonable
 interpretation of the claim (e.g., instances in which the electrocardiac signal data
 is not within the threshold electrocardiac criteria such that the condition precedent
 for the determining step and the remaining steps of claim 1 has not been met);"
 however to render the claimed system obvious, the prior art must teach the structure
 that performs the function of the contingent step along with the other recited claim
 limitations. *Schulhauser* at 9, 14.

# 2111.05 Functional and Nonfunctional Descriptive
 Material [R-10.2019]


USPTO personnel must consider all claim limitations when
 determining patentability of an invention over the prior art. *In re
 Gulack,* 703 F.2d 1381, 1385, 217 USPQ 401, 403-04 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Since a
 claim must be read as a whole, USPTO personnel may not disregard claim limitations
 comprised of printed matter. See *Id.* at 1384, 217 USPQ at 403; see
 also *Diamond v. Diehr,* 450 U.S. 175, 191, 209 USPQ 1, 10 (1981). The
 first step of the printed matter analysis is the determination that the limitation in
 question is in fact directed toward printed matter. "Our past cases establish a
 necessary condition for falling into the category of printed matter: a limitation is
 printed matter only if it claims the content of information." See *In re
 DiStefano,* 808 F.3d 845, 848, 117 USPQ2d 1265, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2015).
 "[O]nce it is determined that the limitation is directed to printed matter, [the
 examiner] must then determine if the matter is functionally or structurally related to
 the associated physical substrate, and only if the answer is ‘no’ is the printed matter
 owed no patentable weight."  *Id.* at 850, 117 USPQ2d at 1268. If a new
 and nonobvious functional relationship between the printed matter and the substrate does
 exist, the examiner should give patentable weight to printed matter. See *In re
 Lowry,* 32 F.3d 1579, 1583-84, 32 USPQ2d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir.
 1994); *In re Ngai,* 367 F.3d 1336, 70 USPQ2d 1862 (Fed. Cir. 2004);
 *In re Gulack,* 703 F.2d 1381, 1385, 217 USPQ 401, 403-04 (Fed. Cir.
 1983). The rationale behind the printed matter cases, in which, for example, written
 instructions are added to a known product, has been extended to method claims in which
 an instructional limitation is added to a method known in the art. Similar to the
 inquiry for products with printed matter thereon, in such method cases the relevant
 inquiry is whether a new and nonobvious functional relationship with the known method
 exists. See *In re DiStefano,* 808 F.3d 845, 117 USPQ2d 1265 (Fed. Cir.
 2015); *In re Kao,* 639 F.3d 1057, 1072-73, 98 USPQ2d 1799, 1811-12
 (Fed. Cir. 2011); *King Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Eon Labs Inc.,* 616
 F.3d 1267, 1279, 95 USPQ2d 1833, 1842 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 
 

**I.** **DETERMINING WHETHER A FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN PRINTED MATTER
 AND ASSOCIATED SUBSTRATE*** 

***A.******Evidence Supporting a Functional Relationship*** To be given patentable weight, the printed matter
 and associated product must be in a functional relationship. A functional
 relationship can be found where the printed matter performs some function with
 respect to the product to which it is associated. See *Lowry,* 32
 F.3d at 1584, 32 USPQ2d at 1035 (citing *Gulack,* 703 F.2d at
 1386, 217 USPQ at 404). For instance, indicia on a measuring cup perform the
 function of indicating volume within that measuring cup. See *In re
 Miller,* 418 F.2d 1392, 1396, 164 USPQ 46, 49 (CCPA 1969). A
 functional relationship can also be found where the product performs some function
 with respect to the printed matter to which it is associated. For instance, where
 a hatband places a string of numbers in a certain physical relationship to each
 other such that a claimed algorithm is satisfied due to the physical structure of
 the hatband, the hatband performs a function with respect to the string of
 numbers. See *Gulack,* 703 F.2d at 1386-87, 217 USPQ at 405. 
 

***B.******Evidence Against a Functional Relationship*** Where a product merely serves as a support for
 printed matter, no functional relationship exists. These situations may arise
 where the claim as a whole is directed towards conveying a message or meaning to a
 human reader independent of the supporting product. For example, a hatband with
 images displayed on the hatband but not arranged in any particular sequence was
 found to only serve as support and display for the printed matter. See
 *Gulack,* 703 F.2d at 1386, 217 USPQ at 404. Another example
 in which a product merely serves as a support would occur for a deck of playing
 cards having images on each card. See *In re Bryan,* 323 Fed.
 App'x 898 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (unpublished). In *Bryan* the
 applicant asserted that the printed matter allowed the cards to be "collected,
 traded, and drawn"; "identify and distinguish one deck of cards from another"; and
 "enable[] the card to be traded and blind drawn". However, the court found that
 these functions do not pertain to the structure of the apparatus and were instead
 drawn to the method or process of playing a game. See also *Ex parte
 Gwinn,* 112 USPQ 439, 446-47 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1955), in which
 the invention was directed to a set of dice by means of which a game may be
 played. The claims differed from the prior art solely by the printed matter in the
 dice. The claims were properly rejected on prior art because there was no new
 feature of physical structure and no new relation of printed matter to physical
 structure. For example, a claimed measuring tape having electrical wiring
 information thereon, or a generically claimed substrate having a picture of a golf
 ball thereupon, would lack a functional relationship as the claims as a whole are
 directed towards conveying wiring information (unrelated to the measuring tape) or
 an aesthetically pleasing image (unrelated to the substrate) to the reader.
 Additionally, where the printed matter and product do not depend upon each other,
 no functional relationship exists. For example, in a kit containing a set of
 chemicals and a printed set of instructions for using the chemicals, the
 instructions are not related to that particular set of chemicals. *In re
 Ngai,* 367 F.3d at 1339, 70 USPQ2d at 1864.
 

**II.** **FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRINTED MATTER AND ASSOCIATED SUBSTRATE MUST
 BE NEW AND NONOBVIOUS**Once a functional relationship between the product and
 associated printed matter is found, the investigation shifts to the determination of
 whether the relationship is new and nonobvious. For example, a claim to a color-coded
 indicia on a container in which the color indicates the expiration date of the
 container may give rise to a functional relationship. The claim may, however, be
 anticipated by prior art that reads on the claimed invention, or by a combination of
 prior art that teaches the claimed invention.
 

**III.** **MACHINE-READABLE MEDIA**When determining the scope of a claim directed to a
 computer-readable medium containing certain programming, the examiner should first
 look to the relationship between the programming and the intended computer system.
 Where the programming performs some function with respect to the computer with which
 it is associated, a functional relationship will be found. For instance, a claim to
 computer-readable medium programmed with attribute data objects that perform the
 function of facilitating retrieval, addition, and removal of information in the
 intended computer system, establishes a functional relationship such that the claimed
 attribute data objects are given patentable weight. See *Lowry,* 32
 F.3d at 1583-84, 32 USPQ2d at 1035.
 


However, where the claim as a whole is directed to
 conveying a message or meaning to a human reader independent of the intended computer
 system, and/or the computer-readable medium merely serves as a support for
 information or data, no functional relationship exists. For example, a claim to a
 memory stick containing tables of batting averages, or tracks of recorded music,
 utilizes the intended computer system merely as a support for the information. Such
 claims are directed toward conveying meaning to the human reader rather than towards
 establishing a functional relationship between recorded data and the computer. 
 


 A claim directed to a computer readable medium
 storing instructions or executable code that recites an abstract idea must be
 evaluated for eligibility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2106](s2106.html#d0e197244)**.

# 2111.01 Plain Meaning [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section is **applicable** to applications
 subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA except that the
 relevant date is the "effective filing date" of the claimed invention instead of the
 "time of the invention," which is only applicable to applications subject to
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)** and
 **[MPEP
 § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq.]*

**I.** **THE WORDS OF A CLAIM MUST BE GIVEN THEIR "PLAIN MEANING" UNLESS SUCH MEANING
 IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SPECIFICATION**Under a broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI),
 words of the claim must be given their plain meaning, unless such meaning is
 inconsistent with the specification. The plain meaning of a term means the ordinary
 and customary meaning given to the term by those of ordinary skill in the art at the
 time of the invention. The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced
 by a variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the
 specification, drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the
 meaning of a claim term is the specification - the greatest clarity is obtained when
 the specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. The words of the claim
 must be given their plain meaning unless the plain meaning is inconsistent with the
 specification. *In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320,
 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (discussed below); *Chef America, Inc. v. Lamb-Weston,
 Inc.,* 358 F.3d 1371, 1372, 69 USPQ2d 1857 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Ordinary,
 simple English words whose meaning is clear and unquestionable, absent any indication
 that their use in a particular context changes their meaning, are construed to mean
 exactly what they say. Thus, "heating the resulting batter-coated dough to a
 temperature in the range of about 400oF to
 850oF" required heating the dough, rather than the air
 inside an oven, to the specified temperature.).
 


The presumption that a term is given its ordinary and
 customary meaning may be rebutted by the applicant by clearly setting forth a
 different definition of the term in the specification. *In re
 Morris,* 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (the
 USPTO looks to the ordinary use of the claim terms taking into account definitions or
 other "enlightenment" contained in the written description); *But c.f. In re
 Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr.,* 367 F.3d 1359, 1369, 70 USPQ2d 1827, 1834
 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("We have cautioned against reading limitations into a claim from
 the preferred embodiment described in the specification, even if it is the only
 embodiment described, absent clear disclaimer in the specification."). When the
 specification sets a clear path to the claim language, the scope of the claims is
 more easily determined and the public notice function of the claims is best served. 
 


**II.** **IT IS IMPROPER TO IMPORT CLAIM LIMITATIONS FROM THE SPECIFICATION**"Though understanding the claim language may be aided by
 explanations contained in the written description, it is important not to import into
 a claim limitations that are not part of the claim. For example, a particular
 embodiment appearing in the written description may not be read into a claim when the
 claim language is broader than the embodiment." *Superguide Corp. v. DirecTV
 Enterprises, Inc.,* 358 F.3d 870, 875, 69 USPQ2d 1865, 1868 (Fed. Cir.
 2004). See also *Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad Inc.,* 358 F.3d 898,
 906, 69 USPQ2d 1801, 1807 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (discussing recent cases wherein the court
 expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single
 embodiment, the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that
 embodiment); *E-Pass Techs., Inc. v. 3Com Corp.,* 343 F.3d 1364,
 1369, 67 USPQ2d 1947, 1950 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("Interpretation of descriptive
 statements in a patent’s written description is a difficult task, as an inherent
 tension exists as to whether a statement is a clear lexicographic definition or a
 description of a preferred embodiment. The problem is to interpret claims ‘in view of
 the specification’ without unnecessarily importing limitations from the specification
 into the claims."); *Altiris Inc. v. Symantec Corp.,* 318 F.3d 1363,
 1371, 65 USPQ2d 1865, 1869-70 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Although the specification discussed
 only a single embodiment, the court held that it was improper to read a specific
 order of steps into method claims where, as a matter of logic or grammar, the
 language of the method claims did not impose a specific order on the performance of
 the method steps, and the specification did not directly or implicitly require a
 particular order). See also subsection IV., below. When an element is claimed using
 language falling under the scope of **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, 6th paragraph (often broadly referred to as
 means- (or step-) plus- function language), the specification must be consulted to
 determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in
 the claim, and the claimed element is construed as limited to the corresponding
 structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.
 *In re Donaldson,* 16 F.3d 1189, 29 USPQ2d 1845 (Fed. Cir. 1994)
 (see **[MPEP
 § 2181](s2181.html#d0e219279)**- **[MPEP § 2186](s2186.html#d0e220631)**).
 


In *Zletz,**supra,* the examiner and the Board had interpreted claims reading
 "normally solid polypropylene" and "normally solid polypropylene having a crystalline
 polypropylene content" as being limited to "normally solid linear high homopolymers
 of propylene which have a crystalline polypropylene content." The court ruled that
 limitations, not present in the claims, were improperly imported from the
 specification. See also *In re Marosi,* 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ
 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("'[C]laims are not to be read in a vacuum, and limitations
 therein are to be interpreted in light of the specification in giving them their
 ‘broadest reasonable interpretation.'" (quoting *In re
 Okuzawa,* 537 F.2d 545, 548, 190 USPQ 464, 466 (CCPA 1976)). The court
 looked to the specification to construe "essentially free of alkali metal" as
 including unavoidable levels of impurities but no more.). 
 

**III.** **"PLAIN MEANING" REFERS TO THE ORDINARY AND CUSTOMARY MEANING GIVEN TO THE TERM
 BY THOSE OF ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART**"[T]he ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning
 that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the
 time of the invention, *i.e*., as of the effective filing date of
 the patent application." *Phillips v. AWH Corp.,*415 F.3d 1303,
 1313, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2005) *(en banc)*;
 *Sunrace Roots Enter. Co. v. SRAM Corp.,* 336 F.3d 1298, 1302, 67
 USPQ2d 1438, 1441 (Fed. Cir. 2003); *Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC v. Intuitive
 Surgical, Inc.,* 334 F.3d 1294, 1298 67 USPQ2d 1132, 1136 (Fed. Cir.
 2003) ("In the absence of an express intent to impart a novel meaning to the claim
 terms, the words are presumed to take on the ordinary and customary meanings
 attributed to them by those of ordinary skill in the art."). 
 


The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced by a
 variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the specification,
 drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the meaning of a
 claim term is the specification – the greatest clarity is obtained when the
 specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. See, e.g., *In re
 Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.,* 696 F.3d 1142, 1149-50, 104 USPQ2d 1337,
 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (construing the term "electrochemical sensor" as "devoid of
 external connection cables or wires to connect to a sensor control unit" to be
 consistent with "the language of the claims and the specification"); *In re
 Suitco Surface, Inc.,* 603 F.3d 1255, 1260-61, 94 USPQ2d 1640, 1644 (Fed.
 Cir. 2010) (construing the term "material for finishing the top surface of the floor"
 to mean "a clear, uniform layer on the top surface of a floor that is the final
 treatment or coating of a surface" to be consistent with "the express language of the
 claim and the specification"); *Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic
 Inc.,* 90 F.3d 1576, 1583, 39 USPQ2d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996)
 (construing the term "solder reflow temperature" to mean "peak reflow temperature" of
 solder rather than the "liquidus temperature" of solder in order to remain consistent
 with the specification). 
 


It is also appropriate to look to how the claim term is
 used in the prior art, which includes prior art patents, published applications,
 trade publications, and dictionaries. Any meaning of a claim term taken from the
 prior art must be consistent with the use of the claim term in the specification and
 drawings. Moreover , when the specification is clear about the scope and content of a
 claim term, there is no need to turn to extrinsic evidence for claim interpretation.
 *3M Innovative Props. Co. v. Tredegar Corp.,* 725 F.3d 1315,
 1326-28, 107 USPQ2d 1717, 1726-27 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that "continuous
 microtextured skin layer over substantially the entire laminate" was clearly defined
 in the written description, and therefore, there was no need to turn to extrinsic
 evidence to construe the claim).
 

**IV.** **APPLICANT MAY BE OWN LEXICOGRAPHER AND/OR MAY DISAVOW CLAIM SCOPE**The only exceptions to giving the words in a claim
 their ordinary and customary meaning in the art are (1) when the applicant acts as
 their own lexicographer; and (2) when the applicant disavows or disclaims the full
 scope of a claim term in the specification. To act as their own lexicographer, the
 applicant must clearly set forth a special definition of a claim term in the
 specification that differs from the plain and ordinary meaning it would otherwise
 possess. The specification may also include an intentional disclaimer, or disavowal,
 of claim scope. In both of these cases, "the inventor’s intention, as expressed in
 the specification, is regarded as dispositive." *Phillips v. AWH
 Corp.,* 415 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc). See also
 *Starhome GmbH v. AT&T Mobility LLC,* 743 F.3d 849, 857, 109
 USPQ2d 1885, 1890-91 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that the term "gateway" should be
 given its ordinary and customary meaning of "a connection between different networks"
 because nothing in the specification indicated a clear intent to depart from that
 ordinary meaning); *Thorner v. Sony Computer Entm’t Am. LLC,* 669
 F.3d 1362, 1367-68, 101 USPQ2d 1457, 1460 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (The asserted claims of
 the patent were directed to a tactile feedback system for video game controllers
 comprising a flexible pad with a plurality of actuators "attached to said pad." The
 court held that the claims were not limited to actuators attached to the external
 surface of the pad, even though the specification used the word "attached" when
 describing embodiments affixed to the external surface of the pad but the word
 "embedded" when describing embodiments affixed to the internal surface of the pad.
 The court explained that the plain and ordinary meaning of "attached" includes both
 external and internal attachments. Further, there is no clear and explicit statement
 in the specification to redefine "attached" or disavow the full scope of the term.). 
 

***A.******Lexicography***An applicant is entitled to be their own lexicographer and may
 rebut the presumption that claim terms are to be given their ordinary and
 customary meaning by clearly setting forth a definition of the term that is
 different from its ordinary and customary meaning(s) in the specification at the
 time of filing. See *In re Paulsen,* 30 F.3d 1475, 1480,
 31 USPQ2d 1671, 1674 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that an inventor may define
 specific terms used to describe invention, but must do so "with reasonable
 clarity, deliberateness, and precision" and, if done, must "‘set out his uncommon
 definition in some manner within the patent disclosure’ so as to give one of
 ordinary skill in the art notice of the change" in meaning) (quoting
 *Intellicall, Inc. v. Phonometrics, Inc.,* 952 F.2d 1384,
 1387-88, 21 USPQ2d 1383, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). 
 


Where an explicit definition is provided by the
 applicant for a term, that definition will control interpretation of the term as
 it is used in the claim. *Toro Co. v. White Consolidated Industries
 Inc.,* 199 F.3d 1295, 1301, 53 USPQ2d 1065, 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1999)
 (meaning of words used in a claim is not construed in a "lexicographic vacuum, but
 in the context of the specification and drawings"). Thus, if a claim term is used
 in its ordinary and customary meaning throughout the specification, and the
 written description clearly indicates its meaning, then the term in the claim has
 that meaning. *Old Town Canoe Co. v. Confluence Holdings Corp.,*
 448 F.3d 1309, 1317, 78 USPQ2d 1705, 1711 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (The court held that
 "completion of coalescence" must be given its ordinary and customary meaning of
 reaching the end of coalescence. The court explained that even though coalescence
 could theoretically be "completed" by halting the molding process earlier, the
 specification clearly intended that completion of coalescence occurs only after
 the molding process reaches its optimum stage.).
 


However, it is important to note that any special
 meaning assigned to a term "must be sufficiently clear in the specification that
 any departure from common usage would be so understood by a person of experience
 in the field of the invention." *Multiform Desiccants Inc. v. Medzam
 Ltd.,* 133 F.3d 1473, 1477, 45 USPQ2d 1429, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1998). See
 also *Process Control Corp. v. HydReclaim Corp.,* 190 F.3d 1350,
 1357, 52 USPQ2d 1029, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1999) and **[MPEP
 § 2173.05(a)](s2173.html#d0e217839)**. 
 


In some cases, the meaning of a particular claim
 term may be defined by implication, that is, according to the usage of the term in
 the context in the specification. See *Phillips v. AWH Corp.,*
 415 F.3d 1303, 1320-21, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2005) *(en
 banc)*; *Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic Inc.,* 90
 F.3d 1576, 1583, 39 USPQ2d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996). But where the
 specification is ambiguous as to whether the inventor used claim terms
 inconsistent with their ordinary meaning, the ordinary meaning will apply.
 *Merck & Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc.,* 395 F.3d 1364,
 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (The Federal Circuit reversed the district court’s
 construction of the claim term "about" as "exactly." The appellate court explained
 that a passage in the specification the district court relied upon for the
 definition of "about" was too ambiguous to redefine "about" to mean "exactly" in
 clear enough terms. The appellate court held that "about" should instead be given
 its plain and ordinary meaning of "approximately.").
 

***B.******Disavowal***Applicant may also rebut the presumption of plain
 meaning by clearly disavowing the full scope of the claim term in the
 specification. Disavowal, or disclaimer of claim scope, is only considered when it
 is clear and unmistakable. See *SciMed Life Sys., Inc. v. Advanced
 Cardiovascular Sys., Inc.,* 242 F.3d 1337, 1341, 58 USPQ2d 1059, 1063
 (Fed.Cir.2001) ("Where the specification makes clear that the invention does not
 include a particular feature, that feature is deemed to be outside the reach of
 the claims of the patent, even though the language of the claims, read without
 reference to the specification, might be considered broad enough to encompass the
 feature in question."); see also *In re Am. Acad. Of Sci. Tech
 Ctr.,* 367 F.3d 1359, 1365-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (refusing to limit
 claim term "user computer" to only "single-user computers" even though "some of
 the language of the specification, when viewed in isolation, might lead a reader
 to conclude that the term . . . is meant to refer to a computer that serves only a
 single user, the specification as a whole suggests a construction that is not so
 narrow"). But, in some cases, disavowal of a broader claim scope may be made by
 implication, such as where the specification contains only disparaging remarks
 with respect to a feature and every embodiment in the specification excludes that
 feature. *In re Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.,* 696 F.3d 1142,
 1149-50, 104 USPQ2d 1337, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding that the broadest
 reasonable interpretation of the claim term "electrochemical sensor" does not
 include a sensor having "external connection cables or wires" because the
 specification "repeatedly, consistently, and exclusively depict[s] an
 electrochemical sensor without external cables or wires while simultaneously
 disparaging sensors with external cables or wires"). If the examiner believes that
 the broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim is narrower than what the words
 of the claim otherwise suggest as the result of implicit disavowal in the
 specification, then the examiner should make the interpretation clear on the
 record.
 


See also **[MPEP § 2173.05(a)](s2173.html#d0e217839)**.
 

**V.** **SUMMARY OF DETERMINING THE MEANING OF A CLAIM TERM THAT DOES NOT INVOKE 35
 U.S.C. 112(f)**This flow chart indicates the decisions an examiner
 would follow in order to ascertain the proper claim interpretation based on the plain
 meaning definition of BRI. With each decision in the flow chart, a different path may
 need to be taken to conclude whether plain meaning applies or a special definition
 applies.
 


The first question is to determine whether a claim
 term has an ordinary and customary meaning to those of ordinary skill in the art. If
 so, then the examiner should check the specification to determine whether it provides
 a special definition for the claim term. If the specification does not provide a
 special definition for the claim term, the examiner should apply the ordinary and
 customary meaning to the claim term. If the specification provides a special
 definition for the claim term, the examiner should use the special definition.
 However, because there is a presumption that claim terms have their ordinary and
 customary meaning and the specification must provide a clear and intentional use of a
 special definition for the claim term to be treated as having a special definition,
 an Office action should acknowledge and identify the special definition in this
 situation.
 


Moving back to the first question, if a claim term
 does not have an ordinary and customary meaning, the examiner should check the
 specification to determine whether it provides a meaning to the claim term. If no
 reasonably clear meaning can be ascribed to the claim term after considering the
 specification and prior art, the examiner should apply the broadest reasonable
 interpretation to the claim term as it can be best understood. Also, the claim should
 be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** and the
 specification objected to under **[37 CFR 1.75(d)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320295)**.
 


If the specification provides a meaning for the claim
 term, the examiner should use the meaning provided by the specification. It may be
 appropriate for an Office action to acknowledge and identify the special definition
 in this situation.

# 2111.02 Effect of Preamble [R-10.2019]


The determination of whether a preamble limits a claim is made on a
 case-by-case basis in light of the facts in each case; there is no litmus test defining
 when a preamble limits the scope of a claim. *Catalina Mktg. Int’l v.
 Coolsavings.com, Inc.,* 289 F.3d 801, 808, 62 USPQ2d 1781, 1785 (Fed. Cir.
 2002). See *id.* at 808-10, 62 USPQ2d at 1784-86 for a discussion of
 guideposts that have emerged from various decisions exploring the preamble’s effect on
 claim scope, as well as a hypothetical example illustrating these principles. 
 


 "[A] claim preamble has the import that the claim as a whole suggests
 for it." *Bell Communications Research, Inc. v. Vitalink Communications
 Corp.,* 55 F.3d 615, 620, 34 USPQ2d 1816, 1820 (Fed. Cir. 1995). "If the
 claim preamble, when read in the context of the entire claim, recites limitations of the
 claim, or, if the claim preamble is ‘necessary to give life, meaning, and vitality’ to
 the claim, then the claim preamble should be construed as if in the balance of the
 claim." *Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,* 182 F.3d 1298,
 1305, 51 USPQ2d 1161, 1165-66 (Fed. Cir. 1999). See also *Jansen v. Rexall
 Sundown, Inc.,* 342 F.3d 1329, 1333, 68 USPQ2d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2003)
 (In considering the effect of the preamble in a claim directed to a method of treating
 or preventing pernicious anemia in humans by administering a certain vitamin preparation
 to "a human in need thereof," the court held that the claims’ recitation of a patient or
 a human "in need" gives life and meaning to the preamble’s statement of
 purpose.). *Kropa v. Robie,* 187 F.2d 150, 152, 88 USPQ 478, 481
 (CCPA 1951) (A preamble reciting "[a]n abrasive article" was deemed essential to point
 out the invention defined by claims to an article comprising abrasive grains and a
 hardened binder and the process of making it. The court stated "it is only by that
 phrase that it can be known that the subject matter defined by the claims is comprised
 as an abrasive article. Every union of substances capable *inter alia*
 of use as abrasive grains and a binder is not an ‘abrasive article.’" Therefore, the
 preamble served to further define the structure of the article produced.). 
 

**I.** **PREAMBLE STATEMENTS LIMITING STRUCTURE** Any terminology in the preamble that limits the structure of the
 claimed invention must be treated as a claim limitation. See, e.g., *Corning
 Glass Works v. Sumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc.,* 868 F.2d 1251, 1257,
 9 USPQ2d 1962, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (The determination of whether preamble
 recitations are structural limitations can be resolved only on review of the entirety
 of the application "to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented
 and intended to encompass by the claim" as drafted without importing "'extraneous'
 limitations from the specification."); *Pac-Tec Inc. v. Amerace
 Corp.,* 903 F.2d 796, 801, 14 USPQ2d 1871, 1876 (Fed. Cir. 1990)
 (determining that preamble language that constitutes a structural limitation is
 actually part of the claimed invention). See also *In re Stencel,*
 828 F.2d 751, 4 USPQ2d 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (The claim at issue was directed to a
 driver for setting a joint of a threaded collar; however, the body of the claim did
 not directly include the structure of the collar as part of the claimed article. The
 examiner did not consider the preamble, which did set forth the structure of the
 collar, as limiting the claim. The court found that the collar structure could not be
 ignored. While the claim was not directly limited to the collar, the collar structure
 recited in the preamble did limit the structure of the driver. "[T]he framework - the
 teachings of the prior art - against which patentability is measured is not all
 drivers broadly, but drivers suitable for use in combination with this collar, for
 the claims are so limited." *Id.* at 1073, 828 F.2d at 754.).
 

**II.** **PREAMBLE STATEMENTS RECITING PURPOSE OR INTENDED USE**The claim preamble must be read in the context of the entire claim.
 The determination of whether preamble recitations are structural limitations or mere
 statements of purpose or use "can be resolved only on review of the entirety of the
 [record] to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and
 intended to encompass by the claim" as drafted without importing "'extraneous'
 limitations from the specification." *Corning Glass Works,* 868 F.2d
 at 1257, 9 USPQ2d at 1966. If the body of a claim fully and intrinsically sets forth
 all of the limitations of the claimed invention, and the preamble merely states, for
 example, the purpose or intended use of the invention, rather than any distinct
 definition of any of the claimed invention’s limitations, then the preamble is not
 considered a limitation and is of no significance to claim construction.
 *Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,* 182 F.3d 1298, 1305,
 51 USPQ2d 1161, 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1999). See also *Rowe v. Dror,* 112
 F.3d 473, 478, 42 USPQ2d 1550, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("where a patentee defines a
 structurally complete invention in the claim body and uses the preamble only to state
 a purpose or intended use for the invention, the preamble is not a claim
 limitation"); *Kropa v. Robie,* 187 F.2d at 152, 88 USPQ2d at 480-81
 (preamble is not a limitation where claim is directed to a product and the preamble
 merely recites a property inherent in an old product defined by the remainder of the
 claim); *STX LLC. v. Brine,* 211 F.3d 588, 591, 54 USPQ2d 1347, 1350
 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the preamble phrase "which provides improved playing
 and handling characteristics" in a claim drawn to a head for a lacrosse stick was not
 a claim limitation). Compare *Jansen v. Rexall Sundown, Inc.,* 342
 F.3d 1329, 1333-34, 68 USPQ2d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (In a claim directed to a
 method of treating or preventing pernicious anemia in humans by administering a
 certain vitamin preparation to "a human in need thereof," the court held that the
 preamble is not merely a statement of effect that may or may not be desired or
 appreciated, but rather is a statement of the intentional purpose for which the
 method must be performed. Thus the claim is properly interpreted to mean that the
 vitamin preparation must be administered to a human with a recognized need to treat
 or prevent pernicious anemia.); *Nantkwest , Inc. v. Lee,* 686 Fed.
 App'x 864, 867 (Fed. Cir. 2017)(nonprecedential) (The court found that the preamble
 phrase "treating a cancer" "’require[s] lysis of many cells, in order to accomplish
 the goal of treating cancer’ and not merely lysing one or a few cancer cells.");
  *In re Cruciferous Sprout Litig.,* 301 F.3d 1343, 1346-48, 64
 USPQ2d 1202, 1204-05 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (A claim at issue was directed to a method of
 preparing a food rich in glucosinolates wherein cruciferous sprouts are harvested
 prior to the 2-leaf stage. The court held that the preamble phrase "rich in
 glucosinolates" helps define the claimed invention, as evidenced by the specification
 and prosecution history, and thus is a limitation of the claim (although the claim
 was anticipated by prior art that produced sprouts inherently "rich in
 glucosinolates")).
 


During examination, statements in the preamble reciting the purpose
 or intended use of the claimed invention must be evaluated to determine whether or
 not the recited purpose or intended use results in a structural difference (or, in
 the case of process claims, manipulative difference) between the claimed invention
 and the prior art. If so, the recitation serves to limit the claim. See, e.g.,
 *In re Otto,* 312 F.2d 937, 938, 136 USPQ 458, 459 (CCPA 1963)
 (The claims were directed to a core member for hair curlers and a process of making a
 core member for hair curlers. The court held that the intended use of hair curling
 was of no significance to the structure and process of making.); *In re
 Sinex,* 309 F.2d 488, 492, 135 USPQ 302, 305 (CCPA 1962) (statement of
 intended use in an apparatus claim did not distinguish over the prior art apparatus).
 To satisfy an intended use limitation which is limiting, a prior art structure which
 is capable of performing the intended use as recited in the preamble meets the claim.
 See, e.g., *In re Schreiber,* 128 F.3d 1473, 1477, 44 USPQ2d 1429,
 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (anticipation rejection affirmed based on Board’s factual
 finding that the reference dispenser (a spout disclosed as useful for purposes such
 as dispensing oil from an oil can) would be capable of dispensing popcorn in the
 manner set forth in appellant’s claim 1 (a dispensing top for dispensing popcorn in a
 specified manner)) and cases cited therein. See also **[MPEP § 2112](s2112.html#d0e201036)** -
 **[MPEP §
 2112.02](s2112.html#d0e201360)**. 
 


However, a "preamble may provide context for claim construction,
 particularly, where … that preamble’s statement of intended use forms the basis for
 distinguishing the prior art in the patent’s prosecution history."
 *Metabolite Labs., Inc. v. Corp. of Am. Holdings,* 370 F.3d 1354,
 1358-62, 71 USPQ2d 1081, 1084-87 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The patent claim at issue was
 directed to a two-step method for detecting a deficiency of vitamin
 B12 or folic acid, involving (i) assaying a body fluid for
 an "elevated level" of homocysteine, and (ii) "correlating" an "elevated" level with
 a vitamin deficiency. *Id.* at 1358-59, 71 USPQ2d at 1084. The court
 stated that the disputed claim term "correlating" can include comparing with either
 an unelevated level or elevated level, as opposed to only an elevated level because
 adding the "correlating" step in the claim during prosecution to overcome prior art
 tied the preamble directly to the "correlating" step. *Id.* at 1362,
 71 USPQ2d at 1087. The recitation of the intended use of "detecting" a vitamin
 deficiency in the preamble rendered the claimed invention a method for "detecting,"
 and, thus, was not limited to detecting "elevated" levels. *Id.*


See also *Catalina Mktg. Int’l,* 289 F.3d at
 808-09, 62 USPQ2d at 1785 ("[C]lear reliance on the preamble during prosecution to
 distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art transforms the preamble into a
 claim limitation because such reliance indicates use of the preamble to define, in
 part, the claimed invention.…Without such reliance, however, a preamble generally is
 not limiting when the claim body describes a structurally complete invention such
 that deletion of the preamble phrase does not affect the structure or steps of the
 claimed invention." Consequently, "preamble language merely extolling benefits or
 features of the claimed invention does not limit the claim scope without clear
 reliance on those benefits or features as patentably significant."). In
 *Poly-America LP v. GSE Lining Tech. Inc.,* 383 F.3d 1303, 1310,
 72 USPQ2d 1685, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court stated that "a ‘[r]eview of the
 entirety of the ’047 patent reveals that the preamble language relating to
 ‘blown-film’ does not state a purpose or an intended use of the invention, but rather
 discloses a fundamental characteristic of the claimed invention that is properly
 construed as a limitation of the claim.’" Compare *Intirtool, Ltd. v. Texar
 Corp.,* 369 F.3d 1289, 1294-96, 70 USPQ2d 1780, 1783-84 (Fed. Cir. 2004)
 (holding that the preamble of a patent claim directed to a "hand-held punch pliers
 for simultaneously punching and connecting overlapping sheet metal" was not a
 limitation of the claim because (i) the body of the claim described a "structurally
 complete invention" without the preamble, and (ii) statements in prosecution history
 referring to "punching and connecting" function of invention did not constitute
 "clear reliance" on the preamble needed to make the preamble a limitation).

# 2111.03 Transitional Phrases [R-08.2017]


The transitional phrases "comprising", "consisting essentially of" and
 "consisting of" define the scope of a claim with respect to what unrecited additional
 components or steps, if any, are excluded from the scope of the claim. The determination
 of what is or is not excluded by a transitional phrase must be made on a case-by-case
 basis in light of the facts of each case. 
 

**I.** **COMPRISING**The transitional term "comprising", which is synonymous with
 "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-ended and does
 not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. See, e.g., *Mars
 Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co.,* 377 F.3d 1369, 1376, 71 USPQ2d 1837, 1843 (Fed.
 Cir. 2004) ("[L]ike the term ‘comprising,’ the terms ‘containing’ and ‘mixture’ are
 open-ended."). *Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing, L.P.,*
 327 F.3d 1364, 1368, 66 USPQ2d 1631, 1634 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("The transition
 ‘comprising’ in a method claim indicates that the claim is open-ended and allows for
 additional steps."); *Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron Corp.,* 112 F.3d
 495, 501, 42 USPQ2d 1608, 1613 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("Comprising" is a term of art used
 in claim language which means that the named elements are essential, but other
 elements may be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim.);
 *Moleculon Research Corp.**v.**CBS, Inc.,* 793 F.2d 1261, 229 USPQ 805 (Fed. Cir. 1986);
 *In re Baxter,* 656 F.2d 679, 686, 210 USPQ 795, 803 (CCPA 1981);
 *Ex parte Davis,* 80 USPQ 448, 450 (Bd. App. 1948) ("comprising"
 leaves "the claim open for the inclusion of unspecified ingredients even in major
 amounts"). In *Gillette Co. v. Energizer Holdings Inc.,* 405 F.3d
 1367, 1371-73, 74 USPQ2d 1586, 1589-91 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court held that a claim
 to "a safety razor blade unit comprising a guard, a cap, and a group of first,
 second, and third blades" encompasses razors with more than three blades because the
 transitional phrase "comprising" in the preamble and the phrase "group of" are
 presumptively open-ended. "The word ‘comprising’ transitioning from the preamble to
 the body signals that the entire claim is presumptively open-ended."
 *Id.* In contrast, the court noted the phrase "group consisting
 of" is a closed term, which is often used in claim drafting to signal a "Markush
 group" that is by its nature closed. *Id.* The court also emphasized
 that reference to "first," "second," and "third" blades in the claim was not used to
 show a serial or numerical limitation but instead was used to distinguish or identify
 the various members of the group. *Id.*

**II.** **CONSISTING OF**The transitional phrase "consisting of" excludes any element, step,
 or ingredient not specified in the claim. *In re Gray,* 53 F.2d 520,
 11 USPQ 255 (CCPA 1931); *Ex parte Davis,* 80 USPQ 448, 450 (Bd.
 App. 1948) ("consisting of" defined as "closing the claim to the inclusion of
 materials other than those recited except for impurities ordinarily associated
 therewith"). But see *Norian Corp. v. Stryker Corp.,* 363 F.3d 1321,
 1331-32, 70 USPQ2d 1508, 1516 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (holding that a bone repair kit
 
 "consisting of"
 
 
 claimed
 chemicals was infringed by a bone repair kit including a spatula in addition to the
 claimed chemicals because the presence of the spatula was unrelated to the claimed
 invention). A claim which depends from a claim which "consists of" the recited
 elements or steps cannot add an element or step. 
 


When the phrase "consists of" appears in a clause of
 the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, there is an
 "exceptionally strong presumption that a claim term set off with ‘consisting of’ is
 closed to unrecited elements." *Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc.
 v. Berry Plastics Corp.,* 831 F.3d 1350, 1359, 119 USPQ2d 1773, 1781
 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (a layer "selected from the group consisting of" specific resins is
 closed to resins other than those listed). However, the "consisting of" phrase limits
 only the element set forth in that clause; other elements are not excluded from the
 claim as a whole. *Mannesmann Demag Corp.**v.**Engineered Metal Products Co.,* 793 F.2d 1279, 230 USPQ 45 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986). See also *In re Crish,* 393 F.3d 1253, 73 USPQ2d 1364
 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (The claims at issue "related to purified DNA molecules having
 promoter activity for the human involucrin gene (hINV)." *Id.,* 73
 USPQ2d at 1365. In determining the scope of applicant’s claims directed to "a
 purified oligonucleotide comprising at least a portion of the
 nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 wherein said portion consists
 of the nucleotide sequence from … to 2473 of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein
 said portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 has promoter activity," the
 court stated that the use of "consists" in the body of the claims did not limit the
 open-ended "comprising" language in the claims (emphases added).
 *Id.* at 1257, 73 USPQ2d at 1367. The court held that the claimed
 promoter sequence designated as SEQ ID NO:1 was obtained by sequencing the same prior
 art plasmid and was therefore anticipated by the prior art plasmid which necessarily
 possessed the same DNA sequence as the claimed oligonucleotides.
 *Id.* at 1256 and 1259, 73 USPQ2d at 1366 and 1369. The court
 affirmed the Board’s interpretation that the transition phrase "consists" did not
 limit the claims to only the recited numbered nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO:1 and
 that "the transition language ‘comprising’ allowed the claims to cover the entire
 involucrin gene plus other portions of the plasmid, as long as the gene contained the
 specific portions of SEQ ID NO:1 recited by the claim[s]." *Id.* at
 1256, 73 USPQ2d at 1366.).
 


A claim element defined by selection from a group of
 alternatives (a Markush grouping; see **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)** and **[§ 2173.05(h)](s2173.html#d0e218467)**) requires selection
 from a closed group "consisting of" (rather than "comprising" or "including") the
 alternative members. *Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Pharmaceutical Products
 Inc.,* 334 F.3d 1274, 1280, 67 USPQ2d 1191, 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2003). If
 the claim element is intended to encompass combinations or mixtures of the
 alternatives set forth in the Markush grouping, the claim may include qualifying
 language preceding the recited alternatives (such as "at least one member" selected
 from the group), or within the list of alternatives (such as "or mixtures thereof").
 *Id.* In the absence of such qualifying language there is a
 presumption that the Markush group is closed to combinations or mixtures. See
 *Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc. v. Berry Plastics
 Corp.,* 831 F.3d 1350, 1363-64, 119 USPQ2d 1773, 1784-85 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
 (presumption that Markush grouping does not encompass mixtures of listed resins
 overcome by intrinsic evidence in a dependent claim and the specification).
 

**III.** **CONSISTING ESSENTIALLY
 OF**The transitional phrase "consisting essentially of" limits the scope
 of a claim to the specified materials or steps "and those that do not
 materially affect the basic and
 novel characteristic(s)" of the claimed invention.
 *In re Herz,* 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976)
 (emphasis in original) (Prior art hydraulic fluid required a dispersant which
 appellants argued was excluded from claims limited to a functional fluid "consisting
 essentially of" certain components. In finding the claims did not exclude the prior
 art dispersant, the court noted that appellants’ specification indicated the claimed
 composition can contain any well-known additive such as a dispersant, and there was
 no evidence that the presence of a dispersant would materially affect the basic and
 novel characteristic of the claimed invention. The prior art composition had the same
 basic and novel characteristic (increased oxidation resistance) as well as additional
 enhanced detergent and dispersant characteristics.). "A ‘consisting essentially of’
 claim occupies a middle ground between closed claims that are written in a
 ‘consisting of’ format and fully open claims that are drafted in a ‘comprising’
 format." *PPG Industries v. Guardian Industries,* 156 F.3d 1351,
 1354, 48 USPQ2d 1351, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 1998). See also *Atlas Powder v.
 E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co.,* 750 F.2d 1569, 224 USPQ 409 (Fed. Cir.
 1984); *In re Janakirama-Rao,* 317 F.2d 951, 137 USPQ 893 (CCPA
 1963); *Water Technologies Corp. vs. Calco, Ltd.,* 850 F.2d 660, 7
 USPQ2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1988). For the purposes of searching for and applying prior
 art under **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, absent a clear indication in
 the specification or claims of what the basic and novel characteristics actually are,
 "consisting essentially of" will be construed as equivalent to "comprising." See,
 e.g., *PPG,* 156 F.3d at 1355, 48 USPQ2d at 1355 ("PPG could have
 defined the scope of the phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ for purposes of its
 patent by making clear in its specification what it regarded as constituting a
 material change in the basic and novel characteristics of the invention."). See also
 *AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac,* 344 F.3d 1234, 1240-41, 68 USPQ2d
 1280, 1283-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Applicant’s statement in the specification that
 "silicon contents in the coating metal should not exceed about 0.5% by weight" along
 with a discussion of the deleterious effects of silicon provided basis to conclude
 that silicon in excess of 0.5% by weight would materially alter the basic and
 novel properties of the invention. Thus, "consisting essentially of" as recited in
 the preamble was interpreted to permit no more than 0.5% by weight of silicon in the
 aluminum coating.); *In re Janakirama-Rao,* 317 F.2d 951, 954, 137
 USPQ 893, 895-96 (CCPA 1963). If an applicant contends that additional steps or
 materials in the prior art are excluded by the recitation of "consisting essentially
 of," applicant has the burden of showing that the introduction of additional steps or
 components would materially change the characteristics of applicant’s invention.
 *In re De Lajarte,* 337 F.2d 870, 143 USPQ 256 (CCPA 1964). See
 also *Ex parte Hoffman,* 12 USPQ2d 1061, 1063-64 (Bd. Pat. App.
 & Inter. 1989) ("Although ‘consisting essentially of’ is typically used and
 defined in the context of compositions of matter, we find nothing intrinsically wrong
 with the use of such language as a modifier of method steps. . . [rendering] the
 claim open only for the inclusion of steps which do not materially affect the basic
 and novel characteristics of the claimed method. To determine the steps included
 versus excluded the claim must be read in light of the specification. . . . [I]t is
 an applicant’s burden to establish that a step practiced in a prior art method is
 excluded from his claims by ‘consisting essentially of’ language."). 
 

**IV.** **OTHER TRANSITIONAL PHRASES**Transitional phrases such as "having" must be interpreted in light
 of the specification to determine whether open or closed claim language is intended.
 See, e.g., *Lampi Corp. v. American Power Products Inc.,* 228 F.3d
 1365, 1376, 56 USPQ2d 1445, 1453 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (interpreting the term "having" as
 open terminology, allowing the inclusion of other components in addition to those
 recited); *Crystal Semiconductor Corp. v. TriTech Microelectronics Int’l
 Inc.,* 246 F.3d 1336, 1348, 57 USPQ2d 1953, 1959 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (term
 "having" in transitional phrase "does not create a presumption that the body of the
 claim is open"); *Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly &
 Co.,* 119 F.3d 1559, 1573, 43 USPQ2d 1398, 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (in the
 context of a cDNA having a sequence coding for human PI, the term "having" still
 permitted inclusion of other moieties). The transitional phrase "composed of" has
 been interpreted in the same manner as either "consisting of" or "consisting
 essentially of," depending on the facts of the particular case. See *AFG
 Industries, Inc. v. Cardinal IG Company,* 239 F.3d 1239, 1245, 57 USPQ2d
 1776, 1780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (based on specification and other evidence, "composed
 of" interpreted in same manner as "consisting essentially of"); *In re
 Bertsch,* 132 F.2d 1014, 1019-20, 56 USPQ 379, 384 (CCPA 1942) ("Composed
 of" interpreted in same manner as "consisting of"; however, the court further
 remarked that "the words ‘composed of’ may under certain circumstances be given, in
 patent law, a broader meaning than ‘consisting of.’").

# 2111.04 "Adapted to," "Adapted for," "Wherein," "Whereby," and
 Contingent Clauses [R-10.2019]

**I.** **"ADAPTED TO," "ADAPTED FOR,"
 "WHEREIN," and "WHEREBY"**Claim scope is not limited by claim language that suggests or makes
 optional but does not require steps to be performed, or by claim language that does
 not limit a claim to a particular structure. However, examples of claim language,
 although not exhaustive, that may raise a question as to the limiting effect of the
 language in a claim are:
 


* (A) "adapted to" or "adapted for" clauses;
* (B) "wherein" clauses; and
* (C) "whereby" clauses.


The determination of whether each of these clauses is a limitation
 in a claim depends on the specific facts of the case. See, e.g., *Griffin v.
 Bertina,* 285 F.3d 1029, 1034, 62 USPQ2d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (finding
 that a "wherein" clause limited a process claim where the clause gave "meaning and
 purpose to the manipulative steps"). In *In re Giannelli,* 739 F.3d
 1375, 1378, 109 USPQ2d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the court found that an "adapted
 to" clause limited a machine claim where "the written description makes clear that
 'adapted to,' as used in the [patent] application, has a narrower meaning, viz., that
 the claimed machine is designed or constructed to be used as a rowing machine whereby
 a pulling force is exerted on the handles." In *Hoffer v. Microsoft
 Corp.,* 405 F.3d 1326, 1329, 74 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the
 court held that when a "‘whereby’ clause states a condition that is material to
 patentability, it cannot be ignored in order to change the substance of the
 invention." *Id.* However, the court noted that a "‘whereby clause
 in a method claim is not given weight when it simply expresses the intended result of
 a process step positively recited.’" *Id.* (quoting *Minton
 v. Nat’l Ass’n of Securities Dealers, Inc.,* 336 F.3d 1373, 1381, 67
 USPQ2d 1614, 1620 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).
 

**II.** **CONTINGENT
 LIMITATIONS** The broadest reasonable interpretation of a method
 (or process) claim having contingent limitations requires only those steps that must
 be performed and does not include steps that are not required to be performed because
 the condition(s) precedent are not met. For example, assume a method claim requires
 step A if a first condition happens and step B if a second condition happens. If the
 claimed invention may be practiced without either the first or second condition
 happening, then neither step A or B is required by the broadest reasonable
 interpretation of the claim. If the claimed invention requires the first condition to
 occur, then the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim requires step A. If
 the claimed invention requires both the first and second conditions to occur, then
 the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim requires both steps A and B. 
 


 The broadest reasonable interpretation of a system
 (or apparatus or product) claim having structure that performs a function, which only
 needs to occur if a condition precedent is met, requires structure for performing the
 function should the condition occur. The system claim interpretation differs from a
 method claim interpretation because the claimed structure must be present in the
 system regardless of whether the condition is met and the function is actually
 performed. 
 


 See *Ex parte Schulhauser,* Appeal
 2013-007847 (PTAB April 28, 2016) for an analysis of contingent claim limitations in
 the context of both method claims and system claims. In
 *Schulhauser,* both method claims and system claims recited the
 same contingent step. When analyzing the claimed method as a whole, the PTAB
 determined that giving the claim its broadest reasonable interpretation, "[i]f the
 condition for performing a contingent step is not satisfied, the performance recited
 by the step need not be carried out in order for the claimed method to be performed"
 (quotation omitted). *Schulhauser* at 10. When analyzing the claimed
 system as a whole, the PTAB determined that "[t]he broadest reasonable interpretation
 of a system claim having structure that performs a function, which only needs to
 occur if a condition precedent is met, still requires structure for performing the
 function should the condition occur." *Schulhauser* at 14. Therefore
 "[t]he Examiner did not need to present evidence of the obviousness of the [ ] method
 steps of claim 1 that are not required to be performed under a broadest reasonable
 interpretation of the claim (e.g., instances in which the electrocardiac signal data
 is not within the threshold electrocardiac criteria such that the condition precedent
 for the determining step and the remaining steps of claim 1 has not been met);"
 however to render the claimed system obvious, the prior art must teach the structure
 that performs the function of the contingent step along with the other recited claim
 limitations. *Schulhauser* at 9, 14.

# 2111.05 Functional and Nonfunctional Descriptive
 Material [R-10.2019]


USPTO personnel must consider all claim limitations when
 determining patentability of an invention over the prior art. *In re
 Gulack,* 703 F.2d 1381, 1385, 217 USPQ 401, 403-04 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Since a
 claim must be read as a whole, USPTO personnel may not disregard claim limitations
 comprised of printed matter. See *Id.* at 1384, 217 USPQ at 403; see
 also *Diamond v. Diehr,* 450 U.S. 175, 191, 209 USPQ 1, 10 (1981). The
 first step of the printed matter analysis is the determination that the limitation in
 question is in fact directed toward printed matter. "Our past cases establish a
 necessary condition for falling into the category of printed matter: a limitation is
 printed matter only if it claims the content of information." See *In re
 DiStefano,* 808 F.3d 845, 848, 117 USPQ2d 1265, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2015).
 "[O]nce it is determined that the limitation is directed to printed matter, [the
 examiner] must then determine if the matter is functionally or structurally related to
 the associated physical substrate, and only if the answer is ‘no’ is the printed matter
 owed no patentable weight."  *Id.* at 850, 117 USPQ2d at 1268. If a new
 and nonobvious functional relationship between the printed matter and the substrate does
 exist, the examiner should give patentable weight to printed matter. See *In re
 Lowry,* 32 F.3d 1579, 1583-84, 32 USPQ2d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir.
 1994); *In re Ngai,* 367 F.3d 1336, 70 USPQ2d 1862 (Fed. Cir. 2004);
 *In re Gulack,* 703 F.2d 1381, 1385, 217 USPQ 401, 403-04 (Fed. Cir.
 1983). The rationale behind the printed matter cases, in which, for example, written
 instructions are added to a known product, has been extended to method claims in which
 an instructional limitation is added to a method known in the art. Similar to the
 inquiry for products with printed matter thereon, in such method cases the relevant
 inquiry is whether a new and nonobvious functional relationship with the known method
 exists. See *In re DiStefano,* 808 F.3d 845, 117 USPQ2d 1265 (Fed. Cir.
 2015); *In re Kao,* 639 F.3d 1057, 1072-73, 98 USPQ2d 1799, 1811-12
 (Fed. Cir. 2011); *King Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Eon Labs Inc.,* 616
 F.3d 1267, 1279, 95 USPQ2d 1833, 1842 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 
 

**I.** **DETERMINING WHETHER A FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN PRINTED MATTER
 AND ASSOCIATED SUBSTRATE*** 

***A.******Evidence Supporting a Functional Relationship*** To be given patentable weight, the printed matter
 and associated product must be in a functional relationship. A functional
 relationship can be found where the printed matter performs some function with
 respect to the product to which it is associated. See *Lowry,* 32
 F.3d at 1584, 32 USPQ2d at 1035 (citing *Gulack,* 703 F.2d at
 1386, 217 USPQ at 404). For instance, indicia on a measuring cup perform the
 function of indicating volume within that measuring cup. See *In re
 Miller,* 418 F.2d 1392, 1396, 164 USPQ 46, 49 (CCPA 1969). A
 functional relationship can also be found where the product performs some function
 with respect to the printed matter to which it is associated. For instance, where
 a hatband places a string of numbers in a certain physical relationship to each
 other such that a claimed algorithm is satisfied due to the physical structure of
 the hatband, the hatband performs a function with respect to the string of
 numbers. See *Gulack,* 703 F.2d at 1386-87, 217 USPQ at 405. 
 

***B.******Evidence Against a Functional Relationship*** Where a product merely serves as a support for
 printed matter, no functional relationship exists. These situations may arise
 where the claim as a whole is directed towards conveying a message or meaning to a
 human reader independent of the supporting product. For example, a hatband with
 images displayed on the hatband but not arranged in any particular sequence was
 found to only serve as support and display for the printed matter. See
 *Gulack,* 703 F.2d at 1386, 217 USPQ at 404. Another example
 in which a product merely serves as a support would occur for a deck of playing
 cards having images on each card. See *In re Bryan,* 323 Fed.
 App'x 898 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (unpublished). In *Bryan* the
 applicant asserted that the printed matter allowed the cards to be "collected,
 traded, and drawn"; "identify and distinguish one deck of cards from another"; and
 "enable[] the card to be traded and blind drawn". However, the court found that
 these functions do not pertain to the structure of the apparatus and were instead
 drawn to the method or process of playing a game. See also *Ex parte
 Gwinn,* 112 USPQ 439, 446-47 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1955), in which
 the invention was directed to a set of dice by means of which a game may be
 played. The claims differed from the prior art solely by the printed matter in the
 dice. The claims were properly rejected on prior art because there was no new
 feature of physical structure and no new relation of printed matter to physical
 structure. For example, a claimed measuring tape having electrical wiring
 information thereon, or a generically claimed substrate having a picture of a golf
 ball thereupon, would lack a functional relationship as the claims as a whole are
 directed towards conveying wiring information (unrelated to the measuring tape) or
 an aesthetically pleasing image (unrelated to the substrate) to the reader.
 Additionally, where the printed matter and product do not depend upon each other,
 no functional relationship exists. For example, in a kit containing a set of
 chemicals and a printed set of instructions for using the chemicals, the
 instructions are not related to that particular set of chemicals. *In re
 Ngai,* 367 F.3d at 1339, 70 USPQ2d at 1864.
 

**II.** **FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRINTED MATTER AND ASSOCIATED SUBSTRATE MUST
 BE NEW AND NONOBVIOUS**Once a functional relationship between the product and
 associated printed matter is found, the investigation shifts to the determination of
 whether the relationship is new and nonobvious. For example, a claim to a color-coded
 indicia on a container in which the color indicates the expiration date of the
 container may give rise to a functional relationship. The claim may, however, be
 anticipated by prior art that reads on the claimed invention, or by a combination of
 prior art that teaches the claimed invention.
 

**III.** **MACHINE-READABLE MEDIA**When determining the scope of a claim directed to a
 computer-readable medium containing certain programming, the examiner should first
 look to the relationship between the programming and the intended computer system.
 Where the programming performs some function with respect to the computer with which
 it is associated, a functional relationship will be found. For instance, a claim to
 computer-readable medium programmed with attribute data objects that perform the
 function of facilitating retrieval, addition, and removal of information in the
 intended computer system, establishes a functional relationship such that the claimed
 attribute data objects are given patentable weight. See *Lowry,* 32
 F.3d at 1583-84, 32 USPQ2d at 1035.
 


However, where the claim as a whole is directed to
 conveying a message or meaning to a human reader independent of the intended computer
 system, and/or the computer-readable medium merely serves as a support for
 information or data, no functional relationship exists. For example, a claim to a
 memory stick containing tables of batting averages, or tracks of recorded music,
 utilizes the intended computer system merely as a support for the information. Such
 claims are directed toward conveying meaning to the human reader rather than towards
 establishing a functional relationship between recorded data and the computer. 
 


 A claim directed to a computer readable medium
 storing instructions or executable code that recites an abstract idea must be
 evaluated for eligibility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2106](s2106.html#d0e197244)**.
