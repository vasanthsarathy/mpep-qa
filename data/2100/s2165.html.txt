# 2165 The Best Mode Requirement [R-08.2017]

**I.** **REQUIREMENT FOR A DISCLOSURE OF THE BEST MODE**A third requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** (applicable to
 applications filed on or after September 16, 2012) is that:
 



> 
> The specification. . . shall set forth the best mode contemplated by
>  the inventor or joint inventor of carrying out the invention.
>  
> 
> 
> 


The third requirement of the first paragraph of
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** (applicable to applications filed before September 16, 2012)
 is that:
 



> 
> The specification. . . shall set forth the best mode
>  contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.
>  
> 
> 
> 


The best mode requirement is a safeguard against the desire on the part
 of some people to obtain patent protection without making a full disclosure as required
 by the statute. The requirement does not permit inventors to disclose only what they
 know to be their second-best embodiment, while retaining the best for themselves.
 *In re**Nelson,* 280 F.2d 172, 126 USPQ 242 (CCPA 1960).
 


Determining compliance with the best mode requirement requires a
 two-prong inquiry. First, it must be determined whether, at the time the application was
 filed, the inventor possessed a best mode for practicing the invention. This is a
 subjective inquiry which focuses on the inventor’s state of mind at the time of filing.
 Second, if the inventor did possess a best mode, it must be determined whether the
 written description disclosed the best mode such that a person skilled in the art could
 practice it. This is an objective inquiry, focusing on the scope of the claimed
 invention and the level of skill in the art. *Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs.
 Inc.,* 251 F.3d 955, 963, 58 USPQ2d 1865, 1874 (Fed. Cir. 2001). All
 applicants are required to disclose for the claimed subject matter the best mode
 contemplated by the inventor even if the inventor was not the discoverer of that mode.
 *Benger Labs. Ltd.**v. R.K. Laros Co.,* 209 F. Supp. 639, 135 USPQ 11 (E.D. Pa. 1962).
 


Failure to disclose the best mode need not rise to the level of active
 concealment or inequitable conduct in order to support a rejection. Where an inventor
 knows of a specific material or method that will make possible the successful
 reproduction of the claimed invention, but does not disclose it, the best mode
 requirement has not been satisfied. *Union Carbide Corp.**v.**Borg-Warner,* 550 F.2d 355, 193 USPQ 1 (6th Cir. 1977).
 

**II.** **IMPACT OF FAILURE TO DISCLOSE THE BEST MODE PURSUANT TO THE AIA**Section 15 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA),
 Public Law 112-29, 125 Stat. 284 (September 16, 2011), did not eliminate the requirement
 in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, for a disclosure of the best mode, (see
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**) but effective September 16, 2011, it amended
 **[35 U.S.C.
 282](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845)** (the provision that sets forth defenses in a patent validity
 or infringement proceeding) to provide that the failure to disclose the best mode shall
 not be a basis on which any claim of a patent may be canceled or held invalid or
 otherwise unenforceable. As this change is applicable only in patent validity or
 infringement proceedings, it does not alter current patent examining practices as set
 forth above for evaluation of an application for compliance with the best mode
 requirement of **[35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** .
 


 Prior to September 16, 2011, for an invention claimed in
 a later-filed application to receive the benefit of the filing date of an earlier-filed
 application, **[35 U.S.C.
 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)** and **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** required that the invention
 claimed in the later-filed application be disclosed in the earlier-filed application in
 the manner provided by **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. Section 15 of the
 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act also amended **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)** and
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** to modify this requirement such that the disclosure in the
 earlier filed application must be made in the manner provided by **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, "other than the requirement to disclose the
 best mode." This change should not noticeably impact patent examining procedure.
 **[MPEP §
 201.08](s201.html#ch200_d1ff71_198a2_222)** provides that there is no need to determine whether the
 earlier-filed application contains a disclosure of the invention claimed in the later
 filed application in compliance with **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, unless the filing date of the earlier-filed application is actually necessary
 (e.g., to overcome a reference). Examiners should consult with their supervisors if it
 appears that an earlier-filed application does not disclose the best mode for carrying
 out a claimed invention and the filing date of the earlier-filed application is actually
 necessary. **[35 U.S.C.
 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)** and **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** were further amended effective
 for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012 to refer to **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** rather than **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph.
 



# 2165.01 Considerations Relevant to Best Mode [R-11.2013]

**I.** **DETERMINE WHAT IS THE INVENTION**Determine what the invention is — the invention is defined in the
 claims. The specification need not set forth details not relating to the essence of
 the invention. *In re**Bosy,* 360 F.2d 972, 149 USPQ 789 (CCPA 1966). See also
 *Northern Telecom Ltd. v. Samsung Elec. Co.,* 215 F.3d 1281, 55
 USPQ2d 1065 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Unclaimed matter that is unrelated to the operation of
 the claimed invention does not trigger the best mode requirement); *Eli Lilly
 & Co. v. Barr Lab. Inc.,* 251 F.3d 955, 966, 58 USPQ2d 1865, 1877
 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("[P]atentee’s failure to disclose an unclaimed preferred mode for
 accomplishing a routine detail does not violate the best mode requirement because one
 skilled in the art is aware of alternative means for accomplishing the routine detail
 that would still produce the best mode of the claimed invention.").
 

**II.** **SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IS NOT REQUIRED**There is no statutory requirement for the disclosure of a specific
 example — a patent specification is not intended nor required to be a production
 specification. *In re Gay,* 309 F.2d 768, 135 USPQ 311 (CCPA
 1962).
 


The absence of a specific working example is not necessarily
 evidence that the best mode has not been disclosed, nor is the presence of one
 evidence that it has. Best mode may be represented by a preferred range of conditions
 or group of reactants. *In re Honn,* 364 F.2d 454, 150 USPQ 652
 (CCPA 1966).
 

**III.** **DESIGNATION AS BEST MODE IS NOT REQUIRED**There is no requirement in the statute that applicants point out
 which of their embodiments they consider to be their best; that the disclosure
 includes the best mode contemplated by applicants is enough to satisfy the statute.
 *Ernsthausen**v.**Nakayama,* 1 USPQ2d 1539 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1985).
 

**IV.** **UPDATING BEST MODE IS NOT REQUIRED** There is no requirement to update in the context of a foreign
 priority application under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, *Standard
 Oil Co.**v.**Montedison, S.p.A.,* 494 F.Supp. 370, 206 USPQ 676 (D.Del. 1980)
 (better catalyst developed between Italian priority and U.S. filing dates).
 Furthermore, it is not necessary to update the best mode in applications claiming the
 benefit of an earlier filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302951)** or
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, which indicate that the disclosure in the earlier filed
 application must be made in the manner provided by **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, "other than the requirement to disclose the best mode." See
 **[MPEP §
 2165](s2165.html#d0e216924)**, subsection II. 
 

**V.** **DEFECT IN BEST MODE CANNOT BE CURED BY NEW MATTER**If the best mode contemplated by the inventor at the time of filing
 the application is not disclosed, such a defect cannot be cured by submitting an
 amendment seeking to put into the specification something required to be there when
 the patent application was originally filed. *In re**Hay,* 534 F.2d 917, 189 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1976).
 


Any proposed amendment of this type (adding a specific mode of
 practicing the invention not described in the application as filed) should be treated
 as new matter. New matter under **[35 U.S.C. 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)** and
 **[251](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345)** should be objected to and coupled with a requirement to
 cancel the new matter.
 




# 2165.02 Best Mode Requirement Compared to Enablement
 Requirement [R-11.2013]


The best mode requirement is a separate and distinct requirement from
 the enablement requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or the first
 paragraph of **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**. *In re**Newton,* 414 F.2d 1400, 163 USPQ 34 (CCPA 1969).
 


The best mode provision of **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** is not directed to a
 situation where the application fails to set forth any mode — such failure is equivalent
 to nonenablement. *In re**Glass,* 492 F.2d 1228, 181 USPQ 31 (CCPA 1974).
 


The enablement requirement looks to placing the subject matter of the
 claims generally in the possession of the public. If, however, the applicant develops
 specific instrumentalities or techniques which are recognized by the applicant at the
 time of filing as the best way of carrying out the invention, then the best mode
 requirement imposes an obligation to disclose that information to the public as well.
 *Spectra-Physics, Inc.**v.**Coherent, Inc.,* 827 F.2d 1524, 3 USPQ 2d 1737 (Fed. Cir.),
 *cert. denied,* 484 U.S. 954 (1987).
 




# 2165.03 Requirements for Rejection for Lack of Best Mode [R-11.2013]

**I.** **ASSUME BEST MODE IS DISCLOSED UNLESS THERE IS EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY**The examiner should assume that the best mode is disclosed in the
 application, unless evidence is presented that is inconsistent with that assumption.
 It is extremely rare that a best mode rejection properly would be made in *ex
 parte* prosecution. The information that is necessary to form the basis
 for a rejection based on the failure to set forth the best mode is rarely accessible
 to the examiner, but is generally uncovered during *inter partes*
 proceedings.
 

**II.** **EXAMINER MUST DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVENTOR KNEW THAT ONE MODE WAS BETTER
 THAN ANOTHER, AND IF SO, WHETHER THE DISCLOSURE IS ADEQUATE TO ENABLE ONE OF
 ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART TO PRACTICE THE BEST MODE**According to the approach used by the court in *Chemcast
 Corp.**v.**Arco Indus.,* 913 F.2d 923, 16 USPQ2d 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1990), a
 proper best mode analysis has two components:
 


* (A) Determine whether, at the time the application was filed, the
 inventor knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention that the inventor
 considered to be better than any other.
 


The first component is a subjective inquiry because it focuses
 on the inventor’s state of mind at the time the application was filed. Unless
 the examiner has evidence that the inventors had information in their
 possession
 


	+ (1) at the time the application was filed
	+ (2) that a mode was considered to be better than any others
	 by the inventors,


there is no reason to address the second component and there is no
 proper basis for a best mode rejection. If the facts satisfy the first component,
 then, and only then, is the following second component analyzed:
 


* (B) Compare what was known in (A) with what was disclosed - is the
 disclosure adequate to enable one skilled in the art to practice the best
 mode?


Assessing the adequacy of the disclosure in this regard is largely
 an objective inquiry that depends on the level of skill in the art. Is the
 information contained in the specification disclosure sufficient to enable a person
 skilled in the relevant art to make and use the best mode?
 


A best mode rejection is proper only when the first inquiry can be
 answered in the affirmative, and the second inquiry answered in the negative with
 reasons to support the conclusion that the specification is nonenabling with respect
 to the best mode.
 




# 2165.04 Examples of Evidence of Concealment [R-08.2017]


In determining the adequacy of a best mode disclosure, only evidence of
 concealment (accidental or intentional) is to be considered. That evidence must tend to
 show that the quality of an applicant’s best mode disclosure is
 so poor as to effectively result in concealment. 
 

**I.** **EXAMPLES — BEST MODE REQUIREMENT SATISFIED**In one case, even though the inventor had more information in his
 possession concerning the contemplated best mode than was disclosed (a known computer
 program) the specification was held to delineate the best mode in a manner sufficient
 to require only the application of routine skill to produce a workable digital
 computer program. *In re**Sherwood,* 613 F.2d 809, 204 USPQ 537 (CCPA 1980).
 


In another case, the claimed subject matter was a time controlled
 thermostat, but the application did not disclose the specific Quartzmatic motor which
 was used in a commercial embodiment. The court concluded that failure to disclose the
 commercial motor did not amount to concealment since similar clock motors were widely
 available and widely advertised. There was no evidence that the specific Quartzmatic
 motor was superior except possibly in price. *Honeywell**v.**Diamond,* 499 F.Supp 924, 208 USPQ 452 (D.D.C. 1980).
 


There was held to be no violation of the best mode requirement even
 though the inventor did not disclose the only mode of calculating the stretch rate
 for plastic rods that he used because that mode would have been employed by those of
 ordinary skill in the art at the time the application was filed. *W.L. Gore
 & Assoc., Inc.**v. Garlock Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 220 USPQ 303 (Fed. Cir. 1983).
 


There was no best mode violation where the patentee failed to
 disclose in the specification "[k]nown ways to perform a known operation" to practice
 the claimed invention. "Known ways of performing a known operation cannot be deemed
 intentionally concealed absent evidence of intent to deliberately withhold that
 information." *High Concrete Structures Inc. v. New Enter. Stone & Lime
 Co.,* 377 F.3d 1379, 1384, 71 USPQ2d 1948, 1951 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The
 unintentional failure to disclose in the specification the use of a crane to support
 the patented frame in order to carry out the method of loading and tilting the frame
 was held not to defeat the best mode requirement because one of ordinary skill in the
 art would understand and use a crane to move heavy loads. *Id.* "The
 best mode requirement of **[[35 U.S.C.] § 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** is not violated
 by unintentional omission of information that would be readily known to persons in
 the field of the invention." *Id.*


There was no best mode violation where there was no evidence that
 the monoclonal antibodies used by the inventors differed from those obtainable
 according to the processes described in the specification. It was not disputed that
 the inventors obtained the antibodies used in the invention by following the
 procedures in the specification, that these were the inventors’ preferred procedures,
 and that the data reported in the specification was for the antibody that the
 inventors had actually used. *Scripps Clinic and Research Found.**v.**Genentech, Inc.,* 927 F.2d 1565, 18 USPQ 2d 1001 (Fed. Cir.
 1991).
 


Where an organism was created by the insertion of genetic material
 into a cell obtained from generally available sources, all that was required to
 satisfy the best mode requirement was an adequate description of the means for
 carrying out the invention, not deposit of the cells. As to the observation that no
 scientist could ever duplicate exactly the cell used by applicants, the court
 observed that the issue is whether the disclosure is adequate, not that an exact
 duplication is necessary. *Amgen, Inc.**v.**Chugai Pharm. Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 18 USPQ 2d 1016 (Fed. Cir.
 1991).
 


There was held to be no violation of the best mode requirement where
 the Solicitor argued that concealment could be inferred from the disclosure in a
 specification that each analog is "surprisingly and unexpectedly more useful than one
 of the corresponding prostaglandins . . . for at least one of the pharmacological
 purposes." It was argued that appellant must have had test results to substantiate
 this statement and this data should have been disclosed. The court concluded that no
 withholding could be inferred from general statements of increased selectivity and
 narrower spectrum of potency for these novel analogs, conclusions which could be
 drawn from the elementary pharmacological testing of the analogs. *In
 re**Bundy,* 642 F.2d 430, 435, 209 USPQ 48, 52 (CCPA 1981).
 

**II.** **EXAMPLES — BEST MODE REQUIREMENT NOT SATISFIED**The best mode requirement was held to be violated where inventors of
 a laser failed to disclose details of their preferred TiCuSil brazing method which
 were not contained in the prior art and were contrary to criteria for the use of
 TiCuSil as contained in the literature. *Spectra-Physics, Inc.**v.**Coherent, Inc.,* 827 F.2d 1524, 3 USPQ 2d 1737 (Fed. Cir.
 1987).
 


The best mode requirement was violated because an inventor failed to
 disclose whether to use a specific surface treatment that he knew was necessary to
 the satisfactory performance of his invention, even though how to perform the
 treatment itself was known in the art. The argument that the best mode requirement
 may be met solely by reference to what was known in the prior art was rejected as
 incorrect. *Dana Corp.**v.**IPC Ltd. P'ship,* 860 F.2d 415, 8 USPQ2d 1692 (Fed. Cir. 1988).

 Corp.**v.**Arco Indus.,* 913 F.2d 923, 16 USPQ2d 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1990), a
 proper best mode analysis has two components:
 


* (A) Determine whether, at the time the application was filed, the
 inventor knew of a mode of practicing the claimed invention that the inventor
 considered to be better than any other.
 


The first component is a subjective inquiry because it focuses
 on the inventor’s state of mind at the time the application was filed. Unless
 the examiner has evidence that the inventors had information in their
 possession
 


	+ (1) at the time the application was filed
	+ (2) that a mode was considered to be better than any others
	 by the inventors,


there is no reason to address the second component and there is no
 proper basis for a best mode rejection. If the facts satisfy the first component,
 then, and only then, is the following second component analyzed:
 


* (B) Compare what was known in (A) with what was disclosed - is the
 disclosure adequate to enable one skilled in the art to practice the best
 mode?


Assessing the adequacy of the disclosure in this regard is largely
 an objective inquiry that depends on the level of skill in the art. Is the
 information contained in the specification disclosure sufficient to enable a person
 skilled in the relevant art to make and use the best mode?
 


A best mode rejection is proper only when the first inquiry can be
 answered in the affirmative, and the second inquiry answered in the negative with
 reasons to support the conclusion that the specification is nonenabling with respect
 to the best mode.

# 2165.04 Examples of Evidence of Concealment [R-08.2017]


In determining the adequacy of a best mode disclosure, only evidence of
 concealment (accidental or intentional) is to be considered. That evidence must tend to
 show that the quality of an applicant’s best mode disclosure is
 so poor as to effectively result in concealment. 
 

**I.** **EXAMPLES — BEST MODE REQUIREMENT SATISFIED**In one case, even though the inventor had more information in his
 possession concerning the contemplated best mode than was disclosed (a known computer
 program) the specification was held to delineate the best mode in a manner sufficient
 to require only the application of routine skill to produce a workable digital
 computer program. *In re**Sherwood,* 613 F.2d 809, 204 USPQ 537 (CCPA 1980).
 


In another case, the claimed subject matter was a time controlled
 thermostat, but the application did not disclose the specific Quartzmatic motor which
 was used in a commercial embodiment. The court concluded that failure to disclose the
 commercial motor did not amount to concealment since similar clock motors were widely
 available and widely advertised. There was no evidence that the specific Quartzmatic
 motor was superior except possibly in price. *Honeywell**v.**Diamond,* 499 F.Supp 924, 208 USPQ 452 (D.D.C. 1980).
 


There was held to be no violation of the best mode requirement even
 though the inventor did not disclose the only mode of calculating the stretch rate
 for plastic rods that he used because that mode would have been employed by those of
 ordinary skill in the art at the time the application was filed. *W.L. Gore
 & Assoc., Inc.**v. Garlock Inc.,* 721 F.2d 1540, 220 USPQ 303 (Fed. Cir. 1983).
 


There was no best mode violation where the patentee failed to
 disclose in the specification "[k]nown ways to perform a known operation" to practice
 the claimed invention. "Known ways of performing a known operation cannot be deemed
 intentionally concealed absent evidence of intent to deliberately withhold that
 information." *High Concrete Structures Inc. v. New Enter. Stone & Lime
 Co.,* 377 F.3d 1379, 1384, 71 USPQ2d 1948, 1951 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The
 unintentional failure to disclose in the specification the use of a crane to support
 the patented frame in order to carry out the method of loading and tilting the frame
 was held not to defeat the best mode requirement because one of ordinary skill in the
 art would understand and use a crane to move heavy loads. *Id.* "The
 best mode requirement of **[[35 U.S.C.] § 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** is not violated
 by unintentional omission of information that would be readily known to persons in
 the field of the invention." *Id.*


There was no best mode violation where there was no evidence that
 the monoclonal antibodies used by the inventors differed from those obtainable
 according to the processes described in the specification. It was not disputed that
 the inventors obtained the antibodies used in the invention by following the
 procedures in the specification, that these were the inventors’ preferred procedures,
 and that the data reported in the specification was for the antibody that the
 inventors had actually used. *Scripps Clinic and Research Found.**v.**Genentech, Inc.,* 927 F.2d 1565, 18 USPQ 2d 1001 (Fed. Cir.
 1991).
 


Where an organism was created by the insertion of genetic material
 into a cell obtained from generally available sources, all that was required to
 satisfy the best mode requirement was an adequate description of the means for
 carrying out the invention, not deposit of the cells. As to the observation that no
 scientist could ever duplicate exactly the cell used by applicants, the court
 observed that the issue is whether the disclosure is adequate, not that an exact
 duplication is necessary. *Amgen, Inc.**v.**Chugai Pharm. Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 18 USPQ 2d 1016 (Fed. Cir.
 1991).
 


There was held to be no violation of the best mode requirement where
 the Solicitor argued that concealment could be inferred from the disclosure in a
 specification that each analog is "surprisingly and unexpectedly more useful than one
 of the corresponding prostaglandins . . . for at least one of the pharmacological
 purposes." It was argued that appellant must have had test results to substantiate
 this statement and this data should have been disclosed. The court concluded that no
 withholding could be inferred from general statements of increased selectivity and
 narrower spectrum of potency for these novel analogs, conclusions which could be
 drawn from the elementary pharmacological testing of the analogs. *In
 re**Bundy,* 642 F.2d 430, 435, 209 USPQ 48, 52 (CCPA 1981).
 

**II.** **EXAMPLES — BEST MODE REQUIREMENT NOT SATISFIED**The best mode requirement was held to be violated where inventors of
 a laser failed to disclose details of their preferred TiCuSil brazing method which
 were not contained in the prior art and were contrary to criteria for the use of
 TiCuSil as contained in the literature. *Spectra-Physics, Inc.**v.**Coherent, Inc.,* 827 F.2d 1524, 3 USPQ 2d 1737 (Fed. Cir.
 1987).
 


The best mode requirement was violated because an inventor failed to
 disclose whether to use a specific surface treatment that he knew was necessary to
 the satisfactory performance of his invention, even though how to perform the
 treatment itself was known in the art. The argument that the best mode requirement
 may be met solely by reference to what was known in the prior art was rejected as
 incorrect. *Dana Corp.**v.**IPC Ltd. P'ship,* 860 F.2d 415, 8 USPQ2d 1692 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
