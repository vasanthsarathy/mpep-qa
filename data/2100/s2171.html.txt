 Specification*

* The specification shall conclude with one or more
 claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which
 the applicant regards as his invention.

Two separate requirements are set forth in **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** and **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, namely that:
 


* (A) the claims must set forth the subject matter that the inventor or a
 joint inventor regards as the invention; and
* (B) the claims must particularly point out and distinctly define the
 metes and bounds of the subject matter to be protected by the patent grant.


The first requirement is a subjective one because it is dependent on what
 the inventor or a joint inventor for a patent regards as his or her invention. Note that
 although **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second paragraph, uses the phrase "which applicant
 regards as his invention," **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.41(a)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317674)** provides that a
 patent is applied for in the name or names of the actual inventor or inventors. 
 


The second requirement is an objective one because it is not
 dependent on the views of the inventor or any particular individual, but is evaluated in
 the context of whether the claim is definite — i.e., whether the scope of the claim is
 clear to a hypothetical person possessing the ordinary level of skill in the pertinent
 art.
 


Although an essential purpose of the examination process is to determine
 whether or not the claims define an invention that is both novel and nonobvious over the
 prior art, another essential purpose of patent examination is to determine whether or not
 the claims are precise, clear, correct, and unambiguous. The uncertainties of claim scope
 should be removed, as much as possible, during the examination process.
 


The inquiry during examination is patentability of the invention as the
 inventor or a joint inventor regards it. If the claims do not particularly point out and
 distinctly claim that which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as his or her
 invention, the appropriate action by the examiner is to reject the claims under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph. *In re**Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 13 USPQ2d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 1989). If a rejection is
 based on **[35
 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, second
 paragraph, the examiner should further explain whether the rejection is based on
 indefiniteness or on the failure to claim what the inventor or a joint invention regards as
 the invention. *Ex parte**Ionescu,* 222 USPQ 537, 539 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1984).
