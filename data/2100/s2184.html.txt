# 2184 Determining Whether an Applicant Has Met the Burden of Proving
 Nonequivalence After a *Prima Facie* Case Is Made [R-11.2013]


The specification need not necessarily describe the equivalents of the
 structures, material, or acts corresponding to the means-(or step-) plus-function claim
 element. See *In re Noll,* 545 F.2d 141, 149-50, 191 USPQ 721, 727 (CCPA
 1976) (if the meaning of equivalents is well understood in patent law, then an applicant
 need not describe in his specification the full range of equivalents of his invention).
 *Cf.**Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc.,* 802 F.2d 1367, 1384, 231
 USPQ 81, 94 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("a patent need not teach, and preferably omits, what is well
 known in the art"). Where, however, the specification is silent as to what constitutes
 equivalents and the examiner has made out a *prima facie* case of
 equivalence, the burden is placed upon the applicant to show that a prior art element which
 performs the claimed function is not an equivalent of the structure, material, or acts
 disclosed in the specification. See *In re Mulder,* 716 F.2d 1542, 1549,
 219 USPQ 189, 196 (Fed. Cir. 1983).
 


If the applicant disagrees with the inference of equivalence drawn from a
 prior art reference, the applicant may provide reasons why the applicant believes the prior
 art element should not be considered an equivalent to the specific structure, material or
 acts disclosed in the specification. Such reasons may include, but are not limited to: 
 


* (A) Teachings in the specification that particular prior art is not
 equivalent;
* (B) Teachings in the prior art reference itself that may tend to show
 nonequivalence; or
* (C) **[37 CFR
 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** affidavit evidence of facts tending to show
 nonequivalence.

**I.** **TEACHINGS IN APPLICANT’S SPECIFICATION**When the applicant relies on teachings in applicant’s own
 specification, the examiner must make sure that the applicant is interpreting the means-
 (or step-) plus- function limitation in the claim in a manner which is consistent with
 the disclosure in the specification. If the specification defines what is meant by
 "equivalents" to the disclosed embodiments for the purpose of the claimed means- (or
 step-) plus- function, the examiner should interpret the limitation as having that
 meaning. If no definition is provided, some judgment must be exercised in determining
 the scope of "equivalents." Generally, an "equivalent" is interpreted as embracing more
 than the specific elements described in the specification for performing the specified
 function, but less than any element that performs the function specified in the claim.
 See, e.g., *NOMOS Corp. v. BrainLAB USA Inc.,* 357 F.3d, 1364, 1368, 69
 USPQ2d 1853, 1856 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (where only one embodiment is described, the
 corresponding structure is limited to that embodiment and equivalents thereof). To
 interpret means- (or step-) plus-function limitations as limited to a particular means
 (or step) set forth in the specification would nullify the provisions of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** requiring that the limitation shall be
 construed to cover the structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof.
 *D.M.I., Inc.**v.**Deere & Co.,* 755 F.2d 1570, 1574, 225 USPQ 236, 238 (Fed. Cir.
 1985).
 


The scope of equivalents embraced by a claim limitation is dependent on
 the interpretation of an "equivalent." The interpretation will vary depending on how the
 element is described in the supporting specification. The claim may or may not be
 limited to particular structure, material or acts (e.g., steps) as opposed to any and
 all structure, material or acts performing the claimed function, depending on how the
 specification treats that question. See, e.g., *Ishida Co. v. Taylor,*
 221 F.3d 1310, 55 USPQ2d 1449 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (The court construed the scope of a
 means-plus-function claim element where the specification disclosed two structurally
 very different embodiments for performing the claimed function by looking separately to
 each embodiment to determine corresponding structures. The court declined to adopt a
 single claim construction encompassing both embodiments since it would be so broad as to
 describe systems both with and without the fundamental structural features of each
 embodiment.).
 


If the disclosure is so broad as to encompass any and all structures,
 materials or acts for performing the claimed function, the claims must be read
 accordingly when determining patentability. When this happens the limitation otherwise
 provided by "equivalents" ceases to be a limitation on the scope of the claim in that an
 equivalent would be any structure, material or act other than the ones described in the
 specification that perform the claimed function. For example, this situation will often
 be found in cases where (A) the claimed invention is a combination of elements, one or
 more of which are selected from elements that are old, *per se,* or (B)
 apparatus claims are treated as indistinguishable from method claims. See, for example,
 *In re**Meyer,* 688 F.2d 789, 215 USPQ 193 (CCPA 1982); *In
 re**Abele,* 684 F.2d 902, 909, 214 USPQ 682, 688 (CCPA 1982); *In
 re Walter,* 618 F.2d 758, 767, 205 USPQ 397, 406-07 (CCPA 1980); *In
 re**Maucorps,* 609 F.2d 481, 203 USPQ 812 (CCPA 1979); *In
 re**Johnson,* 589 F.2d 1070, 200 USPQ 199 (CCPA 1978); and *In
 re**Freeman,* 573 F.2d 1237, 1246, 197 USPQ 464, 471 (CCPA 1978). 
 


On the other end of the spectrum, the "equivalents" limitation as
 applied to a claim may also operate to constrict the claim scope to the point of
 covering virtually only the disclosed embodiments. This can happen in circumstances
 where the specification describes the invention only in the context of a specific
 structure, material or act that is used to perform the function specified in the
 claim.
 

**II.** **FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING EQUIVALENCE**When deciding whether an applicant has met the burden of proof with
 respect to showing nonequivalence of a prior art element that performs the claimed
 function, the following factors may be considered. First, unless an element performs the
 identical function specified in the claim, it cannot be an equivalent for the purposes
 of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth
 paragraph. *Pennwalt Corp.**v.**Durand-Wayland, Inc.,* 833 F.2d 931, 4 USPQ2d 1737 (Fed. Cir. 1987),
 *cert. denied,* 484 U.S. 961 (1988).
 


Second, while there is no litmus test for an "equivalent" that can be
 applied with absolute certainty and predictability, there are several indicia that are
 sufficient to support a conclusion that one element is or is not an "equivalent" of a
 different element in the context of **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph. Indicia that will support a conclusion that
 one element is or is not an equivalent of another are set forth in **[MPEP § 2183](s2183.html#d0e220121)**.
 

**III.** **MERE ALLEGATIONS OF NONEQUIVALENCE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT** In determining whether arguments or **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** evidence presented by
 an applicant are persuasive that the element shown in the prior art is not an
 equivalent, the examiner should consider and weigh as many of the above-indicated or
 other indicia as are presented by applicant, and should determine whether, on balance,
 the applicant has met the burden of proof to show nonequivalence. However, under no
 circumstance should an examiner accept as persuasive a bare statement or opinion that
 the element shown in the prior art is not an equivalent embraced by the claim
 limitation. Moreover, if an applicant argues that the means- (or step-) plus-function
 language in a claim is limited to certain specific structural or additional functional
 characteristics (as opposed to "equivalents" thereof) where the specification does not
 describe the invention as being only those specific characteristics, the claim should
 not be allowed until the claim is amended to recite those specific structural or
 additional functional characteristics. Otherwise, a claim could be allowed having broad
 functional language which, in reality, is limited to only the specific structure or
 steps disclosed in the specification. This would be contrary to public policy of
 granting patents which provide adequate notice to the public as to a claim’s true
 scope.
 

**IV.** **APPLICANT MAY AMEND CLAIMS** Finally, as in the past, applicant has the opportunity during
 proceedings before the Office to amend the claims so that the claimed invention meets
 all the statutory criteria for patentability. An applicant may choose to amend the claim
 by further limiting the function so that there is no longer identity of function with
 that taught by the prior art element, or the applicant may choose to replace the claimed
 means- (or step-) plus-function limitation with specific structure, material or acts
 that are not described in the prior art.
