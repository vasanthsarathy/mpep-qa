# 2138 Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g) [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions
 of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP §
 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is subject to
 examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies to
 an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination of
 applications subject to those provisions.]*



#### *Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102   
 Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of right to patent.*


A person shall be entitled to a patent unless -


\*\*\*\*\*


* (g) (1) during the course of an interference conducted under
 **[section
 135](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303239)** or **[section 291](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306203)**, another inventor
 involved therein establishes, to the extent permitted in **[section 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**,
 that before such person’s invention thereof the invention was made by such other
 inventor and not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed, or (2) before such person’s
 invention thereof, the invention was made in this country by another inventor who
 had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it. In determining priority of
 invention under this subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective
 dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the
 reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to
 practice, from a time prior to conception by the other.



**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** bars the issuance of a patent where another made the invention
 in the United States before applicant and had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it.
 This section of **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** forms a basis for interference practice. See
 **[MPEP Chapter
 2300](mpep-2300.html#d0e237627)** for more information on interference procedure. See below
 and **[MPEP §§
 2138.01](s2138.html#d0e207148)**-**[2138.06](s2138.html#d0e207967)** for more information on the
 requirements of **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** issues such as conception, reduction to practice and
 diligence, while more commonly applied to interference matters, also arise in other
 contexts. 
 


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** may form the basis for an *ex parte* rejection if: (1) the subject matter at issue has been actually reduced to
 practice by another before the applicant’s invention; and (2) there has been no
 abandonment, suppression or concealment. See, e.g., *Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai
 Pharmaceutical Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 1205, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1020 (Fed. Cir.
 1991); *New Idea Farm Equipment Corp. v. Sperry Corp.,* 916 F.2d 1561,
 1566, 16 USPQ2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1990); *E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v.
 Phillips Petroleum Co.,* 849 F.2d 1430, 1434, 7 USPQ2d 1129, 1132 (Fed. Cir.
 1988); *Kimberly-Clark v. Johnson & Johnson,* 745 F.2d 1437, 1444-46,
 223 USPQ 603, 606-08 (Fed. Cir. 1984). To qualify as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, however, there must be evidence that the subject matter was
 actually reduced to practice, in that conception alone is not sufficient. See
 *Kimberly-Clark,* 745 F.2d at 1445, 223 USPQ at 607. While the filing
 of an application for patent is a constructive reduction to practice, the filing of an
 application does not in itself provide the evidence necessary to show an actual reduction
 to practice of any of the subject matter disclosed in the application as is necessary to
 provide the basis for an *ex parte* rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Thus, absent evidence showing an actual reduction to practice
 (which is generally not available during *ex parte* examination), the
 disclosure of a United States patent application publication or patent falls under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and not under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**.
 *Cf.**In re Zletz,* 893 F.2d 319, 323, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1989)
 (the disclosure in a reference United States patent does not fall under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** but under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**).
 


In addition, subject matter qualifying as prior art only under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** may also be the basis for an *ex parte*
 rejection under **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**. See *In re Bass,* 474 F.2d 1276,
 1283, 177 USPQ 178, 183 (CCPA 1973) (in an unsuccessful attempt to utilize a
 **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** affidavit relating to a combination application, applicants
 admitted that the subcombination screen of a copending application which issued as a patent
 was earlier conceived than the combination). **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, however,
 states that subsection (g) of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** will not preclude
 patentability where subject matter developed by another person, that would otherwise
 qualify under **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, and the claimed invention of an application under
 examination were owned by the same person, subject to an obligation of assignment to the
 same person, or involved in a joint research agreement, which meets the requirements of
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 103(c)(2) and (c)(3)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, at the time the invention was made. See
 **[MPEP §
 2146](s2146.html#d0e213206)**.
 


For additional examples of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** issues such as
 conception, reduction to practice and diligence outside the context of interference
 matters, see *In re Costello,* 717 F.2d 1346, 219 USPQ 389 (Fed. Cir.
 1983) (discussing the concepts of conception and constructive reduction to practice in the
 context of a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**), and *Kawai v.
 Metlesics,* 480 F.2d 880, 178 USPQ 158 (CCPA 1973) (holding constructive
 reduction to practice for priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** requires meeting the
 requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**).
 



# 2138.01 Interference Practice [R-08.2017]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies
 to an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination
 of applications subject to those provisions.]*

**I.** **PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g) IS THE BASIS OF INTERFERENCE PRACTICE**Subsection (g) of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is the
 basis of interference practice for determining priority of invention between two
 parties. See  *Bigham v. Godtfredsen,* 857 F.2d 1415, 1416, 8 USPQ2d
 1266, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 1988), **[35 U.S.C. 135](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303239)**, 37 CFR Part 41,
 Subparts D and E and **[MPEP Chapter 2300](mpep-2300.html#d0e237627)**. An interference is an *inter
 partes* proceeding directed at determining the first to invent as among
 the parties to the proceeding, involving two or more pending applications naming
 different inventors or one or more pending applications and one or more unexpired
 patents naming different inventors. The United States is unusual in having a first to
 invent rather than a first to file system in certain applications. *Paulik v.
 Rizkalla,* 760 F.2d 1270, 1272, 226 USPQ 224, 225 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (reviews the legislative history of the subsection in a concurring opinion by Judge
 Rich). The first of many to reduce an invention to practice around the same time will
 be the sole party to obtain a patent in some instances, *Radio Corp. of
 America**v.**Radio Eng’g Labs., Inc.,* 293 U.S. 1, 2, 21 USPQ 353, 353-4 (1934),
 unless another was the first to conceive and couple a later-in-time reduction to
 practice with diligence from a time just prior to when the second conceiver entered
 the field to the first conceiver’s reduction to practice. *Hull v.
 Davenport,* 90 F.2d 103, 105, 33 USPQ 506, 508 (CCPA 1937). See the
 priority time charts below illustrating this point. Upon conclusion of an
 interference, subject matter claimed by the losing party that was the basis of the
 interference is rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, unless
 the acts showing prior invention were not in this country.
 


It is noted that **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** requires that
 whoever invents or discovers the claimed invention is the party that must be named as
 the inventor(s) before a parent may be granted. Where it can be shown that an
 applicant has "derived" an invention from another, a rejection under
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is proper if applicable. *Ex parte
 Kusko,* 215 USPQ 972, 974 (Bd. App. 1981) ("most, if not all,
 determinations under **[[pre-AIA] Section 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** involve
 the question of whether one party derived an invention from another"); *Price
 v. Symsek,* 988 F.2d 1187, 1190, 26 USPQ2d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 (Although derivation and priority of invention both focus on inventorship, derivation
 addresses originality, i.e., who invented the subject matter, whereas priority
 focuses on which party invented the subject matter first.). 
 

**II.** **PRIORITY TIME CHARTS**The following priority time charts illustrate the award of invention
 priority in several situations. The time charts apply to interference proceedings and
 are also applicable to declarations or affidavits filed under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** to antedate references which are available as prior art
 under **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or **[102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Note, however, in the
 context of **[37
 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**, an applicant does not have to show that the
 invention was not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed from the time of an actual
 reduction to practice to a constructive reduction to practice because the length of
 time taken to file a patent application after an actual reduction to practice is
 generally of no consequence except in an interference proceeding. *Paulik v.
 Rizkalla,* 760 F.2d 1270, 226 USPQ 224 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See the
 discussion of abandonment, suppression, and concealment in **[MPEP §
 2138.03](s2138.html#d0e207478)**.
 


For purposes of analysis under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**, the conception and reduction to practice of the
 reference to be antedated are both considered to be on the effective filing date of
 domestic patent or foreign patent or the date of printed publication.
 


In the charts, C = conception, R = reduction to practice (either
 actual or constructive), Ra = actual reduction to practice, Rc = constructive
 reduction to practice, and TD = commencement of diligence.
 


**Example 1**![Priority Time Chart Example 1](graphics/2138_01-1.png)
A is awarded priority in an interference, or antedates B as a
 reference in the context of a declaration or affidavit filed under
 **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**, because A conceived the invention before B and
 constructively reduced the invention to practice before B reduced the invention to
 practice. The same result would be reached if the conception date was the same for
 both inventors A and B. 
 



**Example 2**![Priority Time Chart Example 2](graphics/2138_01-2.png)
A is awarded priority in an interference, or antedates B as a
 reference in the context of a declaration or affidavit filed under
 **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**, if A can show reasonable diligence from
 TD (a point just prior to B’s conception) until Rc
 because A conceived the invention before B, and diligently constructively reduced
 the invention to practice even though this was after B reduced the invention to
 practice.
 



**Example 3**![Priority Time Chart Example 3](graphics/2138_01-3.png)
A is awarded priority in an interference in the absence of
 abandonment, suppression, or concealment from Ra to Rc, because A conceived the
 invention before B, actually reduced the invention to practice before B reduced
 the invention to practice, and did not abandon, suppress, or conceal the invention
 after actually reducing the invention to practice and before constructively
 reducing the invention to practice.
 


A antedates B as a reference in the context of a declaration or
 affidavit filed under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** because A
 conceived the invention before B and actually reduced the invention to practice
 before B reduced the invention to practice.
 



**Example 4**![Priority Time Chart Example 4](graphics/2138_01-4.png)
A is awarded priority in an interference if A can show reasonable
 diligence from TD (a point just prior to B’s conception)
 until Ra in the absence of abandonment, suppression, or concealment from Ra to Rc,
 because A conceived the invention before B, diligently actually reduced the
 invention to practice (after B reduced the invention to practice), and did not
 abandon, suppress, or conceal the invention after actually reducing the invention
 to practice and before constructively reducing the invention to practice.
 


A antedates B as a reference in the context of a declaration or
 affidavit filed under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** because A
 conceived the invention before B, and diligently actually reduced the invention to
 practice, even though this was after B reduced the invention to practice.
 


**III.** **37 CFR 1.131 DOES NOT APPLY IN INTERFERENCE PROCEEDINGS**Interference practice operates to the exclusion of *ex
 parte* practice under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** which permits an
 applicant to show an actual date of invention prior to the effective date of a
 reference or activity applied under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, as long as the reference is not a statutory bar under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** or a U.S. patent application publication claiming
 the same patentable invention. *Ex parte Standish,* 10 USPQ2d 1454,
 1457 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1988) (An application claim to the "same patentable
 invention" claimed in a domestic patent requires interference rather than an
 affidavit under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** to antedate the patent. The term "same patentable
 invention" encompasses a claim that is either anticipated by or obvious in view of
 the subject matter recited in the patent claim.). Subject matter which is prior art
 under **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** and is subject to an interference is not open to
 further inquiry under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** during the
 interference proceeding.
 

**IV.** **LOST COUNTS IN AN INTERFERENCE ARE NOT, *PER SE,* STATUTORY
 PRIOR ART**Loss of an interference count alone does not make its subject matter
 statutory prior art to losing party; however, lost count
 subject matter that is available as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 may be used alone or in combination with other references under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.
 But see *In re Deckler,* 977 F.2d 1449, 24 USPQ2d 1448 (Fed. Cir.
 1992) (Under the principles of *res judicata* and *collateral estoppel,* Deckler was not entitled to claims that were
 patentably indistinguishable from the claim lost in interference even though the
 subject matter of the lost count was not available for use in an obviousness
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.).
 




# 2138.02 "The Invention Was Made in This Country" [R-11.2013]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies
 to an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination
 of applications subject to those provisions.]*


An invention is made when there is a conception and a reduction to
 practice. *Dunn v. Ragin,* 50 USPQ 472, 474 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1941).
 Prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is limited to an invention that is made.
 *In re Katz,* 687 F.2d 450, 454, 215 USPQ 14, 17 (CCPA 1982) (the
 publication of an article, alone, is not deemed a constructive reduction to practice,
 and therefore its disclosure does not prove that any invention within the meaning of
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** has ever been made). 
 


Subject matter under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is
 available only if made in this country. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**.
 *Kondo v. Martel,* 220 USPQ 47 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1983) (acts of
 conception, reduction to practice and diligence must be demonstrated in this country).
 Compare *Colbert v. Lofdahl,* 21 USPQ2d 1068, 1071 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1991) ("[i]f the invention is reduced to practice in a foreign country and
 knowledge of the invention was brought into this country and disclosed to others, the
 inventor can derive no benefit from the work done abroad and such knowledge is merely
 evidence of conception of the invention").
 


 In accordance with **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, a party
 involved in an interference proceeding under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 135](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303239)** or
 **[291](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306203)** may establish a date of invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**, as amended by
 GATT (Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994)) and NAFTA (Public Law 103-182, 107
 Stat. 2057 (1993)), provides that an applicant can establish a date of invention in a
 NAFTA member country on or after December 8, 1993 or in WTO member country other than a
 NAFTA member country on or after January 1, 1996. Accordingly, an interference count may
 be won or lost on the basis of establishment of invention by one of the parties in a
 NAFTA or WTO member country, thereby rendering the subject matter of that count
 unpatentable to the other party under the principles of *res judicata*
 and *collateral estoppel,* even though such subject matter is not
 available as statutory prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2138.01](s2138.html#d0e207148)** regarding lost interference counts which are not
 statutory prior art.

 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies
 to an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination
 of applications subject to those provisions.]*


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** generally makes available as prior art within the meaning
 of **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the prior invention of another who has not abandoned,
 suppressed or concealed it. *In re Bass,* 474 F.2d 1276, 177 USPQ 178
 (CCPA 1973); *In re Suska,* 589 F.2d 527, 200 USPQ 497 (CCPA 1979) (The
 result of applying the suppression and concealment doctrine is that the inventor who did
 not conceal (but was the *de facto* last inventor) is treated legally
 as the first to invent, while the *de facto* first inventor who
 suppressed or concealed is treated as a later inventor. The *de facto*
 first inventor, by his suppression and concealment, lost the right to rely on his actual
 date of invention not only for priority purposes, but also for purposes of avoiding the
 invention of the counts as prior art.).
 


"The courts have consistently held that an invention, though completed,
 is deemed abandoned, suppressed, or concealed if, within a reasonable time after
 completion, no steps are taken to make the invention publicly known. Thus failure to
 file a patent application; to describe the invention in a publicly disseminated
 document; or to use the invention publicly, have been held to constitute abandonment,
 suppression, or concealment." *Correge v. Murphy,* 705 F.2d 1326, 1330,
 217 USPQ 753, 756 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quoting *International Glass Co.**v.**United States,* 408 F.2d 395, 403, 159 USPQ 434, 441 (Ct. Cl. 1968)).
 In *Correge,* an invention was actually reduced to practice, 7 months
 later there was a public disclosure of the invention, and 8 months thereafter a patent
 application was filed. The court held filing a patent application within 1 year of a
 public disclosure is not an unreasonable delay, therefore reasonable diligence must only
 be shown between the date of the actual reduction to practice and the public disclosure
 to avoid the inference of abandonment.
 

**I.** **DURING AN INTERFERENCE PROCEEDING, AN INFERENCE OF SUPPRESSION OR CONCEALMENT
 MAY ARISE FROM DELAY IN FILING PATENT APPLICATION**Once an invention is actually reduced to practice an inventor need
 not rush to file a patent application. *Shindelar v. Holdeman,* 628
 F.2d 1337, 1341, 207 USPQ 112, 116 (CCPA 1980). The length of time taken to file a
 patent application after an actual reduction to practice is generally of no
 consequence except in an interference proceeding. *Paulik v.
 Rizkalla,* 760 F.2d 1270, 1271, 226 USPQ 225, 226 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (suppression or concealment may be deliberate or may arise due to an inference from a
 "too long" delay in filing a patent application). *Peeler v.
 Miller,* 535 F.2d 647, 656, 190 USPQ 117,124 (CCPA 1976) ("mere delay,
 without more, is not sufficient to establish suppression or concealment." "What we
 are deciding here is that Monsanto’s delay is not ‘merely delay’ and that Monsanto's
 justification for the delay is inadequate to overcome the inference of suppression
 created by the excessive delay." The word "mere" does not imply a total absence of a
 limit on the duration of delay. Whether any delay is "mere" is decided only on a
 case-by-case basis.).
 


Where a junior party in an interference relies upon an actual
 reduction to practice to demonstrate first inventorship, and where the hiatus in time
 between the date for the junior party's asserted reduction to practice and the filing
 of its application is unreasonably long, the hiatus may give rise to an inference
 that the junior party in fact suppressed or concealed the invention and the junior
 party will not be allowed to rely upon the earlier actual reduction to practice.
 *Young v. Dworkin,* 489 F.2d 1277, 1280 n.3, 180 USPQ 388, 391
 n.3 (CCPA 1974) (suppression and concealment issues are to be addressed on a
 case-by-case basis). 
 

**II.** **SUPPRESSION OR CONCEALMENT NEED NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO INVENTOR**Suppression or concealment need not be attributed to the inventor.
 *Peeler v. Miller,* 535 F.2d 647, 653-54, 190 USPQ 117, 122 (CCPA
 1976) ("four year delay from the time an inventor … completes his work … and the time
 his assignee-employer files a patent application is, *prima facie,*
 unreasonably long in an interference with a party who filed first"); *Shindelar v. Holdeman,* 628 F.2d 1337, 1341-42, 207 USPQ 112, 116-17
 (CCPA 1980) (A patent attorney’s workload will not preclude a holding of an
 unreasonable delay— the court identified that a total of 3 months was possibly
 excusable in regard to the filing of an application.).
 

**III.** **INFERENCE OF SUPPRESSION OR CONCEALMENT IS REBUTTABLE**Notwithstanding an inference of suppression or concealment due to
 time(s) of inactivity after reduction to practice, the senior party may still prevail
 if the senior party shows renewed activity on the invention that is just prior to the
 junior party’s entry into field coupled with the diligent filing of an application.
 *Lutzker**v.**Plet,* 843 F.2d 1364, 1367-69, 6 USPQ2d 1370, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir.
 1988) (activities directed towards commercialization not sufficient to rebut
 inference); *Holmwood v. Cherpeck,* 2 USPQ2d 1942, 1945 (Bd. Pat.
 App. & Inter. 1986) (the inference of suppression or concealment may be rebutted
 by showing activity directed to perfecting the invention, preparing the application,
 or preparing other compounds within the scope of the generic invention);
 *Engelhardt v. Judd,* 369 F.2d 408, 411, 151 USPQ 732, 735 (CCPA
 1966) ("We recognize that an inventor of a new series of compounds should not be
 forced to file applications piecemeal on each new member as it is synthesized,
 identified and tested for utility. A reasonable amount of time should be allowed for
 completion of the research project on the whole series of new compounds, and a
 further reasonable time period should then be allowed for drafting and filing the
 patent application(s) thereon."); *Bogoslowsky**v.**Huse,* 142 F.2d 75, 77, 61 USPQ 349, 351 (CCPA 1944) (The doctrine
 of suppression and concealment is not applicable to conception without an actual
 reduction to practice.).
 

**IV.** **ABANDONMENT**A finding of suppression or concealment may not amount to a finding
 of abandonment wherein a right to a patent is lost. *Steierman v.
 Connelly,* 197 USPQ 288, 289 (Comm'r Pat. 1976); *Correge v.
 Murphy,* 705 F.2d 1326, 1329, 217 USPQ 753, 755 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (an
 invention cannot be abandoned until it is first reduced to practice).

*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is

Conception has been defined as "the complete performance of the mental
 part of the inventive act" and it is "the formation in the mind of the inventor of a
 definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter
 to be applied in practice…." *Townsend v. Smith,* 36 F.2d 292, 295, 4
 USPQ 269, 271 (CCPA 1929). "[C]onception is established when the invention is made
 sufficiently clear to enable one skilled in the art to reduce it to practice without the
 exercise of extensive experimentation or the exercise of inventive skill."
 *Hiatt v. Ziegler,* 179 USPQ 757, 763 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1973).
 Conception has also been defined as a disclosure of an invention which enables one
 skilled in the art to reduce the invention to a practical form without "exercise of the
 inventive faculty." *Gunter v. Stream,* 573 F.2d 77, 197 USPQ 482 (CCPA
 1978). See also *Coleman v. Dines,* 754 F.2d 353, 224 USPQ 857 (Fed.
 Cir. 1985) (It is settled that in establishing conception a party must show possession
 of every feature recited in the count, and that every limitation of the count must have
 been known to the inventor at the time of the alleged conception. Conception must be
 proved by corroborating evidence.); *Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies
 Inc.,* 802 F. 2d 1367, 1376, 231 USPQ 81, 87 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Conception is
 the "formation in the mind of the inventor, of a definite and permanent idea of the
 complete and operative invention, as it is hereafter to be applied in practice.");
 *Hitzeman v. Rutter,* 243 F.3d 1345, 58 USPQ2d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2001)
 (Inventor’s "hope" that a genetically altered yeast would produce antigen particles
 having the particle size and sedimentation rates recited in the claims did not establish
 conception, since the inventor did not show that he had a "definite and permanent
 understanding" as to whether or how, or a reasonable expectation that, the yeast would
 produce the recited antigen particles.); *Staehelin v. Secher,* 24
 USPQ2d 1513, 1522 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) ("evidence of conception naming only
 one of the actual inventive entity inures to the benefit of and serves as evidence of
 conception by the complete inventive entity").
 

**I.** **CONCEPTION MUST BE DONE IN THE MIND OF THE INVENTOR**The inventor must form a definite and
 permanent idea of the complete and operable invention to establish conception.
 *Bosies v. Benedict,* 27 F.3d 539, 543, 30 USPQ2d 1862, 1865
 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Testimony by a noninventor as to the meaning of a variable of a
 generic compound described in an inventor’s notebook was insufficient as a matter of
 law to establish the meaning of the variable because the testimony was not probative
 of what the inventors conceived.). A person who shares in the conception of a claimed
 invention is a joint inventor of that invention. *In re VerHoef,*
 888 F.3d 1362, 1366-67, 126 F.2d 1561, 1564-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018).
 

**II.** **CONCEPTION REQUIRES CONTEMPORANEOUS RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF THE
 INVENTION**There must be a contemporaneous recognition and appreciation of the
 invention for there to be conception. *Silvestri v. Grant,* 496 F.2d
 593, 596, 181 USPQ 706, 708 (CCPA 1974) ("an accidental and unappreciated duplication
 of an invention does not defeat the patent right of one who, though later in time was
 the first to recognize that which constitutes the inventive subject matter");
 *Invitrogen,**Corp. v. Clontech Laboratories, Inc.,* 429 F.3d 1052, 1064,
 77 USPQ2d 1161, 1169 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (In situations where there is unrecognized
 accidental duplication, establishing conception requires evidence that the inventor
 actually made the invention and understood the invention to have the features that
 comprise the inventive subject matter at issue).*Langer v. Kaufman,*
 465 F.2d 915, 918, 175 USPQ 172, 174 (CCPA 1972) (new form of catalyst was not
 recognized when it was first produced; conception cannot be established *nunc
 pro tunc*). However, an inventor does not need to know that the invention
 will work for there to be complete conception. *Burroughs Wellcome Co. v.
 Barr Labs., Inc.,* 40 F.3d 1223, 1228, 32 USPQ2d 1915, 1919 (Fed. Cir.
 1994) (Draft patent application disclosing treatment of AIDS with AZT reciting
 dosages, forms, and routes of administration was sufficient to collaborate conception
 whether or not the inventors believed the inventions would work based on initial
 screening tests.) Furthermore, the inventor does not need to appreciate the
 patentability of the invention. *Dow Chem. Co. v. Astro-Valcour,
 Inc.,* 267 F.3d 1334, 1341, 60 USPQ2d 1519, 1523 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
 


The first to conceive of a species is not necessarily the first to
 conceive of the generic invention. *In re Jolley,* 308 F.3d 1317,
 1323 n.2, 64 USPQ2d 1901, 1905 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Further, while conception of a
 species within a genus may constitute conception of the genus, conception of one
 species and the genus may not constitute conception of another species in the genus.
 *Oka v. Youssefyeh,* 849 F.2d 581, 7 USPQ2d 1169 (Fed. Cir. 1988)
 (conception of a chemical requires both the idea of the structure of the chemical and
 possession of an operative method of making it). See also *Amgen, Inc. v.
 Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 1206, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1021
 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (in the isolation of a gene, defining a gene by its principal
 biological property is not sufficient for conception absent an ability to envision
 the detailed constitution as well as a method for obtaining it); *Fiers v.
 Revel,* 984 F.2d 1164, 1170, 25 USPQ2d 1601, 1605 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 ("[b]efore reduction to practice, conception only of a process for making a
 substance, without conception of a structural or equivalent definition of that
 substance, can at most constitute a conception of the substance claimed as a process"
 but cannot constitute conception of the substance; as "conception is not enablement,"
 conception of a purified DNA sequence coding for a specific protein by function and a
 method for its isolation that could be carried out by one of ordinary skill in the
 art is not conception of that material). See **[MPEP §§
 2106.04(b)](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c)** and **[2106.04(c)](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1)** for information on the subject matter
 eligibility of inventions involving isolated genes.
 


On rare occasions conception and reduction to practice occur
 simultaneously in unpredictable technologies. *Alpert v. Slatin,*
 305 F.2d 891, 894, 134 USPQ 296, 299 (CCPA 1962). "[I]n some unpredictable areas of
 chemistry and biology, there is no conception until the invention has been reduced to
 practice." *MacMillan v.**Moffett,* 432 F.2d 1237, 1234-40, 167 USPQ 550, 552-553 (CCPA
 1970). See also *Hitzeman v. Rutter,* 243 F.3d 1345, 58 USPQ2d 1161
 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (conception simultaneous with reduction to practice where appellant
 lacked reasonable certainty that yeast’s performance of certain intracellular
 processes would result in the claimed antigen particles); *Dunn v.
 Ragin,* 50 USPQ 472, 475 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1941) (a new variety of
 asexually reproduced plant is conceived and reduced to practice when it is grown and
 recognized as a new variety). Under these circumstances, conception is not complete
 if subsequent experimentation reveals factual uncertainty which "so undermines the
 specificity of the inventor’s idea that it is not yet a definite and permanent
 reflection of the complete invention as it will be used in practice."
 *Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc.,* 40 F.3d 1223, 1229,
 32 USPQ2d 1915, 1920 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
 

**III.** **A PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED APPLICATION WHICH WAS NOT COPENDING WITH A SUBSEQUENT
 APPLICATION IS EVIDENCE ONLY OF CONCEPTION**An abandoned application with which no subsequent application was
 copending serves to abandon benefit of the application’s filing as a constructive
 reduction to practice and the abandoned application is evidence only of conception.
 *In re Costello,* 717 F.2d 1346, 1350, 219 USPQ 389, 392 (Fed.
 Cir. 1983).
 




# 2138.05 "Reduction to Practice" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies
 to an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination
 of applications subject to those provisions.]*


Reduction to practice may be an actual reduction or a constructive
 reduction to practice which occurs when a patent application on the claimed invention is
 filed. The filing of a patent application serves as conception and constructive
 reduction to practice of the subject matter described in the application. Thus the
 inventor need not provide evidence of either conception or actual reduction to practice
 when relying on the content of the patent application. *Hyatt v.
 Boone,* 146 F.3d 1348, 1352, 47 USPQ2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1998). A
 reduction to practice can be done by another on behalf of the inventor. *De
 Solms v.**Schoenwald,* 15 USPQ2d 1507, 1510 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990).
 "While the filing of the original application theoretically constituted a constructive
 reduction to practice at the time, the subsequent abandonment of that application also
 resulted in an abandonment of the benefit of that filing as a constructive reduction to
 practice. The filing of the original application is, however, evidence of conception of
 the invention." *In re Costello,* 717 F.2d 1346, 1350, 219 USPQ 389,
 392 (Fed. Cir. 1983)(The second application was not co-pending with the original
 application and it did not reference the original application. Because of the
 requirements of **[35
 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** had not been satisfied, the filing of the original
 application was not recognized as constructive reduction to practice of the
 invention.).
 

**I.** **CONSTRUCTIVE REDUCTION TO PRACTICE REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH 35 U.S.C. 112(a)
 or PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, FIRST PARAGRAPH**When a party to an interference seeks the benefit of an
 earlier-filed U.S. patent application, the earlier application must meet the
 requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** and **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph for the subject matter of the count. The earlier application must meet the
 enablement requirement and must contain a written description of the subject matter
 of the interference count. *Hyatt v. Boone,* 146 F.3d 1348, 1352,
 47 USPQ2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Proof of a constructive reduction to practice
 requires sufficient disclosure under the "how to use" and "how to make" requirements
 of **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. *Kawai v. Metlesics,* 480 F.2d 880, 886, 178 USPQ 158,
 163 (CCPA 1973) (A constructive reduction to practice is not proven unless the
 specification discloses a practical utility where one would not be obvious. Prior art
 which disclosed an anticonvulsant compound which differed from the claimed compound
 only in the absence of a -CH2- group connecting two functional
 groups was not sufficient to establish utility of the claimed compound because the
 compounds were not so closely related that they could be presumed to have the same
 utility.). The purpose of the written description requirement is "to ensure that the
 inventor had possession, as of the filing date of the application relied on, of the
 specific subject matter later claimed by him." *In re Edwards,* 568
 F.2d 1349, 1351-52, 196 USPQ 465, 467 (CCPA 1978). The written description must
 include all of the limitations of the interference count, or the applicant must show
 that any absent text is necessarily comprehended in the description provided and
 would have been so understood at the time the patent application was filed.
 Furthermore, the written description must be sufficient, when the entire
 specification is considered, such that the "necessary and only reasonable
 construction" that would be given it by a person skilled in the art is one that
 clearly supports each positive limitation in the count. *Hyatt v.
 Boone,* 146 F.3d at 1354-55, 47 USPQ2d at 1130-1132 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The
 claim could be read as describing subject matter other than that of the count and
 thus did not establish that the applicant was in possession of the invention of the
 count.). See also *Bigham v. Godtfredsen,* 857 F.2d 1415, 1417,
 8 USPQ2d 1266, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("[t]he generic term halogen comprehends a
 limited number of species, and ordinarily constitutes a sufficient written
 description of the common halogen species," except where the halogen species are
 patentably distinct). 
 

**II.** **REQUIREMENTS TO ESTABLISH ACTUAL REDUCTION TO PRACTICE** "In an interference proceeding, a party seeking to establish an
 actual reduction to practice must satisfy a two-prong test: (1) the party constructed
 an embodiment or performed a process that met every element of the interference
 count, and (2) the embodiment or process operated for its intended purpose."
 *Eaton v. Evans,* 204 F.3d 1094, 1097, 53 USPQ2d 1696, 1698 (Fed.
 Cir. 2000).
 


The same evidence sufficient for a constructive reduction to
 practice may be insufficient to establish an actual reduction to practice, which
 requires a showing of the invention in a physical or tangible form that shows every
 element of the count. *Wetmore v. Quick,* 536 F.2d 937, 942, 190
 USPQ 223, 227 (CCPA 1976). For an actual reduction to practice, the invention must
 have been sufficiently tested to demonstrate that it will work for its intended
 purpose, but it need not be in a commercially satisfactory stage of development. See,
 e.g., *Scott v. Finney,* 34 F.3d 1058, 1062, 32 USPQ2d 1115, 1118-19
 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citing numerous cases wherein the character of the testing
 necessary to support an actual reduction to practice varied with the complexity of
 the invention and the problem it solved). If a device is so simple, and its purpose
 and efficacy so obvious, construction alone is sufficient to demonstrate workability.
 *King Instrument Corp. v. Otari Corp.,* 767 F.2d 853, 860, 226
 USPQ 402, 407 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 


For additional cases pertaining to the requirements necessary to
 establish actual reduction to practice see *DSL Dynamic Sciences, Ltd. v.
 Union Switch & Signal, Inc.,* 928 F.2d 1122, 1126, 18 USPQ2d 1152,
 1155 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("events occurring after an alleged actual reduction to
 practice can call into question whether reduction to practice has in fact occurred");
 *Fitzgerald v. Arbib,* 268 F.2d 763, 765-66, 122 USPQ 530, 531-32
 (CCPA 1959) ("the reduction to practice of a three-dimensional design invention
 requires the production of an article embodying that design" in "other than a mere
 drawing"); *Birmingham v. Randall,* 171 F.2d 957, 80 USPQ 371, 372
 (CCPA 1948) (To establish an actual reduction to practice of an invention directed to
 a method of making a product, it is not enough to show that the method was performed.
 "[S]uch an invention is not reduced to practice until it is established that the
 product made by the process is satisfactory, and [ ] this may require successful
 testing of the product."). 
 

**III.** **TESTING REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AN ACTUAL REDUCTION TO PRACTICE**"The nature of testing which is required to establish a reduction to
 practice depends on the particular facts of each case, especially the nature of the
 invention." *Gellert v. Wanberg,* 495 F.2d 779, 783, 181 USPQ 648,
 652 (CCPA 1974) ("an invention may be tested sufficiently … where less than all of
 the conditions of actual use are duplicated by the tests"); *Wells v.
 Fremont,* 177 USPQ 22, 24-5 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1972) ("even where tests are
 conducted under ‘bench’ or laboratory conditions, those conditions must ‘fully
 duplicate each and every condition of actual use’ or if they do not, then the
 evidence must establish a relationship between the subject matter, the test condition
 and the intended functional setting of the invention," but it is not required that
 all the conditions of all actual uses be duplicated, such as rain, snow, mud, dust
 and submersion in water). 
 

**IV.** **REDUCTION TO PRACTICE REQUIRES RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF THE
 INVENTION**The invention must be recognized and appreciated for a reduction to
 practice to occur. "The rule that conception and reduction to practice cannot be
 established nunc pro tunc simply requires that in order for an experiment to
 constitute an actual reduction to practice, there must have been contemporaneous
 appreciation of the invention at issue by the inventor…. Subsequent testing or later
 recognition may not be used to show that a party had contemporaneous appreciation of
 the invention. However, evidence of subsequent testing may be admitted for the
 purpose of showing that an embodiment was produced and that it met the limitations of
 the count." *Cooper v. Goldfarb,* 154 F.3d 1321, 1331, 47 USPQ2d
 1896, 1904 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). *Meitzner v.
 Corte,* 537 F.2d 524, 528, 190 USPQ 407, 410 (CCPA 1976) (there can be no
 conception or reduction to practice of a new form or of a process using such a new
 form of an otherwise old composition where there has been no recognition or
 appreciation of the existence of the new form); *Estee Lauder, Inc. v.
 L’Oreal S.A.,* 129 F.3d 588, 593, 44 USPQ2d 1610, 1615 (Fed. Cir. 1997)
 ("[W]hen testing is necessary to establish utility, there must be recognition and
 appreciation that the tests were successful for reduction to practice to occur." A
 showing that testing was completed before the critical date, and that testing
 ultimately proved successful, was held insufficient to establish a reduction to
 practice before the critical date, since the success of the testing was not
 appreciated or recognized until after the critical date.); *Parker v.
 Frilette,* 462 F.2d 544, 547, 174 USPQ 321, 324 (CCPA 1972) ("[an]
 inventor need not understand precisely why his invention works in order to achieve an
 actual reduction to practice"). 
 

**V.** **RECOGNITION OF THE INVENTION BY ANOTHER MAY INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE
 INVENTOR** "Inurement involves a claim by an inventor that, as a matter of
 law, the acts of another person should accrue to the benefit of the inventor."
 *Cooper v. Goldfarb,* 154 F.3d 1321, 1331, 47 USPQ2d 1896, 1904
 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Before a non-inventor’s recognition of the utility of the invention
 can inure to the benefit of the inventor, the following three-prong test must be met:
 (1) the inventor must have conceived of the invention, (2) the inventor must have had
 an expectation that the embodiment tested would work for the intended purpose of the
 invention, and (3) the inventor must have submitted the embodiment for testing for
 the intended purpose of the invention. *Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron
 Corp.,* 220 F.3d 1345, 1354, 55 USPQ2d 1636, 1643 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In
 *Genentech,* a non-inventor hired by the inventors to test yeast
 samples for the presence of the fusion protein encoded by the DNA construct of the
 invention recognized the growth-enhancing property of the fusion protein, but did not
 communicate this recognition to the inventors. The court found that because the
 inventors did not submit the samples for testing growth-promoting activity, the
 intended purpose of the invention, the third prong was not satisfied and the
 uncommunicated recognition of the activity of the fusion protein by the non-inventor
 did not inure to the benefit of the inventor. See also *Cooper v.
 Goldfarb,* 240 F.3d 1378, 1385, 57 USPQ2d 1990, 1995 (Fed. Cir. 2001)
 (Cooper sent to Goldfarb samples of a material for use in vascular grafts. At the
 time the samples were sent, Cooper was unaware of the importance of the fibril length
 of the material. Cooper did not at any time later convey to, or request from,
 Goldfarb any information regarding fibril length. Therefore, Goldfarb’s determination
 of the fibril lengths of the material could not inure to Cooper’s benefit.). 
 

**VI.** **IN AN INTERFERENCE PROCEEDING, ALL LIMITATIONS OF A COUNT MUST BE REDUCED TO
 PRACTICE**The device reduced to practice must include every limitation of the
 count. *Fredkin v. Irasek,* 397 F.2d 342, 158 USPQ 280, 285 (CCPA
 1968); every limitation in a count is material and must be proved to establish an
 actual reduction to practice.  *Meitzner v. Corte,* 537 F.2d 524,
 528, 190 USPQ 407, 410 (CCPA 1976). See also *Hull v. Bonis,* 214
 USPQ 731, 734 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1982) (no doctrine of equivalents—remedy is a
 preliminary motion to amend the count to conform to the proofs). 
 

**VII.** **CLAIMED INVENTION IS NOT ACTUALLY REDUCED TO PRACTICE UNLESS THERE IS A KNOWN
 UTILITY**Utility for the invention must be known at the time of the reduction
 to practice. *Wiesner v. Weigert,* 666 F.2d 582, 588, 212 USPQ 721,
 726 (CCPA 1981) (except for plant and design inventions); *Azar v.
 Burns,* 188 USPQ 601, 604 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1975) (a composition and a
 method cannot be actually reduced to practice unless the composition and the product
 produced by the method have a practical utility);  *Ciric v.
 Flanigen,* 511 F.2d 1182, 1185, 185 USPQ 103, 105-6 (CCPA 1975) ("when a
 count does not recite any particular utility, evidence establishing a substantial
 utility for any purpose is sufficient to prove a reduction to practice"; "the
 demonstrated similarity of ion exchange and adsorptive properties between the newly
 discovered zeolites and known crystalline zeolites … have established utility for the
 zeolites of the count"); *Engelhardt v. Judd,* 369 F.2d 408, 411,
 151 USPQ 732, 735 (CCPA 1966) (When considering an actual reduction to practice as a
 bar to patentability for claims to compounds, it is sufficient to successfully
 demonstrate utility of the compounds in animals for somewhat different pharmaceutical
 purposes than those asserted in the specification for humans.); *Rey-Bellet
 v. Engelhardt,* 493 F.2d 1380, 1384, 181 USPQ 453, 455 (CCPA 1974) (Two
 categories of tests on laboratory animals have been considered adequate to show
 utility and reduction to practice: first, tests carried out to prove utility in
 humans where there is a satisfactory correlation between humans and animals, and
 second, tests carried out to prove utility for treating animals.).
 

**VIII.** **A PROBABLE UTILITY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH UTILITY**A probable utility does not establish a practical utility, which is
 established by actual testing or where the utility can be "foretold with certainty."
 *Bindra v. Kelly,* 206 USPQ 570, 575 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1979)
 (Reduction to practice was not established for an intermediate useful in the
 preparation of a second intermediate with a known utility in the preparation of a
 pharmaceutical. The record established there was a high degree of probability of a
 successful preparation because one skilled in the art may have been motivated, in the
 sense of **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, to prepare the second intermediate from the first
 intermediate. However, a strong probability of utility is not sufficient to establish
 practical utility.); *Wu v. Jucker,* 167 USPQ 467, 472 (Bd. Pat.
 Inter. 1968) (screening test where there was an indication of possible utility is
 insufficient to establish practical utility). But see *Nelson v.
 Bowler,* 628 F.2d 853, 858, 206 USPQ 881, 885 (CCPA 1980) (Relevant
 evidence is judged as a whole for its persuasiveness in linking observed properties
 to suggested uses. Reasonable correlation between the two is sufficient for an actual
 reduction to practice.).
 




# 2138.06 "Reasonable Diligence" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies
 to an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination
 of applications subject to those provisions.]*


The diligence of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** relates to
 reasonable "attorney-diligence" and "engineering-diligence" *(Keizer v.
 Bradley,* 270 F.2d 396, 397, 123 USPQ 215, 216 (CCPA 1959)), which does not
 require that "an inventor or his attorney … drop all other work and concentrate on the
 particular invention involved…." *Emery v. Ronden,* 188 USPQ 264, 268
 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1974). 
 

**I.** **CRITICAL PERIOD FOR ESTABLISHING DILIGENCE BETWEEN ONE WHO WAS FIRST TO
 CONCEIVE BUT LATER TO REDUCE TO PRACTICE**The critical period for diligence for a first conceiver but second
 reducer begins not at the time of conception of the first conceiver but just prior to
 the entry in the field of the party who was first to reduce to practice and continues
 until the first conceiver reduces to practice. *Hull v. Davenport,*
 90 F.2d 103, 105, 33 USPQ 506, 508 (CCPA 1937) ("lack of diligence from the time of
 conception to the time immediately preceding the conception date of the second
 conceiver is not regarded as of importance except as it may have a bearing upon his
 subsequent acts"). What serves as the entry date into the field of a first reducer is
 dependent upon what is being relied on by the first reducer, e.g., conception plus
 reasonable diligence to reduction to practice *(Fritsch v. Lin,* 21
 USPQ2d 1731, 1734 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991), *Emery v.
 Ronden,* 188 USPQ 264, 268 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1974)); an actual reduction
 to practice or a constructive reduction to practice by the filing of either a U.S.
 application *(Rebstock v. Flouret,* 191 USPQ 342, 345 (Bd. Pat.
 Inter. 1975)) or reliance upon priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** of a foreign
 application *(Justus v. Appenzeller,* 177 USPQ 332, 339 (Bd. Pat.
 Inter. 1971) (chain of priorities under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** and
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** denied for failure
 to supply certified copy of the foreign application during pendency of the
 application that was filed within the twelve month period prescribed by
 **[35 U.S.C.
 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**)). 
 

**II.** **THE ENTIRE PERIOD DURING WHICH DILIGENCE IS REQUIRED MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY
 EITHER AFFIRMATIVE ACTS OR ACCEPTABLE EXCUSES**"A patent owner need not prove the inventor
 *continuously* exercised reasonable diligence throughout the
 critical period; it must show there was *reasonably continuous*
 diligence." *Perfect Surgical Techniques, Inc. v. Olympus Am.,
 Inc.,* 841 F.3d 1004, 1009, 120 USPQ2d 1605, 1609 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
 (emphasis in original) (citing *Tyco Healthcare Grp. v. Ethicon EndoSurgery,
 Inc.,* 774 F.3d 968, 975, 112 USPQ2d 1979 (Fed. Cir. 2014) and
 *Monsanto Co. v. Mycogen Plant Sci., Inc.,* 261 F.3d 1356, 1370,
 59 USPQ2d 1930, 1939 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).
 


An applicant must account for the entire period during which
 diligence is required. *Gould v. Schawlow,* 363 F.2d 908, 919, 150
 USPQ 634, 643 (CCPA 1966) (Merely stating that there were no weeks or months that the
 invention was not worked on is not enough.); *In re Harry,* 333 F.2d
 920, 923, 142 USPQ 164, 166 (CCPA 1964) (statement that the subject matter "was
 diligently reduced to practice" is not a showing but a mere pleading). A 2-day period
 lacking activity has been held to be fatal. *In re Mulder,* 716 F.2d
 1542, 1545, 219 USPQ 189, 193 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (**[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** issue); *Fitzgerald v. Arbib,* 268 F.2d
 763, 766, 122 USPQ 530, 532 (CCPA 1959) (Less than 1 month of inactivity during the
 critical period shows a lack of diligence. Efforts to exploit an invention
 commercially do not constitute diligence in reducing it to practice. An actual
 reduction to practice in the case of a design for a three-dimensional article
 requires that it should be embodied in some structure other than a mere drawing.);
 *Kendall v. Searles,* 173 F.2d 986, 993, 81 USPQ 363, 369 (CCPA
 1949) (Evidence of diligence must be specific as to dates and facts.). 
 


The period during which diligence is required must be accounted for
 by either affirmative acts or acceptable excuses. *Rebstock v.
 Flouret,* 191 USPQ 342, 345 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1975); *Rieser v.
 Williams,* 225 F.2d 419, 423, 118 USPQ 96, 100 (CCPA 1958) (Being last to
 reduce to practice, party cannot prevail unless he has shown that he was first to
 conceive and that he exercised reasonable diligence during the critical period from
 just prior to opponent’s entry into the field); *Griffith v.
 Kanamaru,* 816 F.2d 624, 2 USPQ2d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Court generally
 reviewed cases on excuses for inactivity including vacation extended by ill health
 and daily job demands, and held lack of university funding and personnel are not
 acceptable excuses.); *Litchfield v. Eigen,* 535 F.2d 72, 190 USPQ
 113 (CCPA 1976) (budgetary limits and availability of animals for testing not
 sufficiently described); *Morway v. Bondi,* 203 F.2d 741, 749, 97
 USPQ 318, 323 (CCPA 1953) (voluntarily laying aside inventive concept in pursuit of
 other projects is generally not an acceptable excuse although there may be
 circumstances creating exceptions); *Anderson v. Crowther,* 152 USPQ
 504, 512 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1965) (preparation of routine periodic reports covering all
 accomplishments of the laboratory insufficient to show diligence); *Wu v.
 Jucker,* 167 USPQ 467, 472-73 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1968) (applicant
 improperly allowed test data sheets to accumulate to a sufficient amount to justify
 interfering with equipment then in use on another project); *Tucker v.
 Natta,* 171 USPQ 494,498 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1971) ("[a]ctivity directed
 toward the reduction to practice of a genus does not establish, *prima
 facie,* diligence toward the reduction to practice of a species embraced
 by said genus"); *Justus v. Appenzeller,* 177 USPQ 332, 340-1 (Bd.
 Pat. Inter. 1971) (Although it is possible that patentee could have reduced the
 invention to practice in a shorter time by relying on stock items rather than by
 designing a particular piece of hardware, patentee exercised reasonable diligence to
 secure the required hardware to actually reduce the invention to practice. "[I]n
 deciding the question of diligence it is immaterial that the inventor may not have
 taken the expeditious course….").
 


Examiners should weigh the body of evidence to make
 the determination of whether there was reasonably continuous diligence for the entire
 critical period. This determination should be made with the purpose of the diligence
 requirement in mind, which "is to assure that, in light of the evidence as a whole,
 ‘the invention as not abandoned or unreasonably delayed.’" *Perfect Surgical
 Techniques, Inc. v. Olympus Am., Inc.* (*Perfect
 Surgical*), 841 F.3d 1004, 1009, 120 USPQ2d 1605, 1609 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
 (citations omitted). In *Perfect Surgical*, the Federal Circuit
 stated:
 




> 
> Under this standard, an inventor is not
>  required to work on reducing his invention to practice every day during the
>  critical period. … And periods of inactivity within the critical period do not
>  automatically vanquish a patent owner's claim of reasonable diligence…. In
>  determining whether an invention antedates another, the point of the diligence

>  intervals of time where the patent owner has failed to substantiate some sort
>  of activity. It is to assure that, in light of the evidence as a whole, "the
>  invention was not abandoned or unreasonably delayed." ... That an inventor

 120 USPQ2d at 1609 (citations omitted).
 

**III.** **WORK RELIED UPON TO SHOW REASONABLE DILIGENCE MUST BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE
 REDUCTION TO PRACTICE**The work relied upon to show reasonable diligence must be directly
 related to the reduction to practice of the invention in issue. *Naber v.
 Cricchi,* 567 F.2d 382, 384, 196 USPQ 294, 296 (CCPA 1977),
 *cert. denied,* 439 U.S. 826 (1978). See also *Scott v.
 Koyama,* 281 F.3d 1243, 1248-49, 61 USPQ2d 1856, 1859 (Fed. Cir. 2002)
 (Activities directed at building a plant to practice the claimed process of producing
 tetrafluoroethane on a large scale constituted efforts toward actual reduction to
 practice, and thus were evidence of diligence. The court distinguished cases where
 diligence was not found because inventors either discontinued development or failed
 to complete the invention while pursuing financing or other commercial activity.);
 *In re Jolley,* 308 F.3d 1317, 1326-27, 64 USPQ2d 1901, 1908-09
 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (diligence found based on research and procurement activities
 related to the subject matter of the interference count). "[U]nder some circumstances
 an inventor should also be able to rely on work on closely related inventions as
 support for diligence toward the reduction to practice on an invention in issue."
 *Ginos v. Nedelec,* 220 USPQ 831, 836 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1983)
 (work on other closely related compounds that were considered to be part of the same
 invention and which were included as part of a grandparent application). "The work
 relied upon must be directed to attaining a reduction to practice of the subject
 matter of the counts. It is not sufficient that the activity relied on concerns
 related subject matter." *Gunn v. Bosch,* 181 USPQ 758, 761 (Bd.
 Pat. Inter. 1973) (An actual reduction to practice of the invention at issue which
 occurred when the inventor was working on a different invention "was fortuitous, and
 not the result of a continuous intent or effort to reduce to practice the invention
 here in issue. Such fortuitousness is inconsistent with the exercise of diligence
 toward reduction to practice of that invention." 181 USPQ at 761. Furthermore,
 evidence drawn towards work on improvement of samples or specimens generally already
 in use at the time of conception that are but one element of the oscillator circuit
 of the count does not show diligence towards the construction and testing of the
 overall combination.); *Broos v. Barton,* 142 F.2d 690, 691, 61 USPQ
 447, 448 (CCPA 1944) (preparation of application in U.S. for foreign filing
 constitutes diligence); *De Solms v. Schoenwald,* 15 USPQ2d 1507
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990) (principles of diligence must be given to
 inventor’s circumstances including skill and time; requirement of corroboration
 applies only to testimony of inventor); *Huelster v. Reiter,* 168
 F.2d 542, 78 USPQ 82 (CCPA 1948) (if inventor was not able to make an actual
 reduction to practice of the invention, he must also show why he was not able to
 constructively reduce the invention to practice by the filing of an application).
 

**IV.** **DILIGENCE REQUIRED IN PREPARING AND FILING PATENT APPLICATION**The diligence of attorney in preparing and filing patent application
 inures to the benefit of the inventor. Conception was established at least as early
 as the date a draft of a patent application was finished by a patent attorney on
 behalf of the inventor. Conception is less a matter of signature than it is one of
 disclosure. Attorney does not prepare a patent application on behalf of particular
 named persons, but on behalf of the true inventive entity. Six days to execute and
 file application is acceptable. *Haskell v. Coleburne,* 671 F.2d
 1362, 213 USPQ 192, 195 (CCPA 1982). See also *Bey v. Kollonitsch,*
 806 F.2d 1024, 231 USPQ 967 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Reasonable diligence is all that is
 required of the attorney. Reasonable diligence is established if attorney worked
 reasonably hard on the application during the continuous critical period. If the
 attorney has a reasonable backlog of unrelated cases which the attorney takes up in
 chronological order and carries out expeditiously, that is sufficient. Work on a
 related case(s) that contributed substantially to the ultimate preparation of an
 application can be credited as diligence.). In "the preparation" of a patent
 application, "the absence of evidence that an inventor and his attorney revised or
 discussed the application on a daily basis is alone insufficient to determine that
 the invention was abandoned or unreasonably delayed." *Perfect Surgical
 Techniques, Inc. v. Olympus Am., Inc.,* 841 F.3d 1004, 1009, 120 USPQ2d
 1605, 1609 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 
 

**V.** **END OF DILIGENCE PERIOD IS MARKED BY EITHER ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE REDUCTION
 TO PRACTICE**"[I]t is of no moment that the end of that period [for diligence] is
 fixed by a constructive, rather than an actual, reduction to practice."
 *Justus v. Appenzeller,* 177 USPQ 332, 340-41 (Bd. Pat. Inter.
 1971).

# 2138.01 Interference Practice [R-08.2017]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to

**I.** **PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g) IS THE BASIS OF INTERFERENCE PRACTICE**Subsection (g) of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is the
 basis of interference practice for determining priority of invention between two

 1266, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 1988), **[35 U.S.C. 135](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303239)**, 37 CFR Part 41,
 Subparts D and E and **[MPEP Chapter 2300](mpep-2300.html#d0e237627)**. An interference is an *inter
 partes* proceeding directed at determining the first to invent as among
 the parties to the proceeding, involving two or more pending applications naming
 different inventors or one or more pending applications and one or more unexpired
 patents naming different inventors. The United States is unusual in having a first to
 invent rather than a first to file system in certain applications. *Paulik v.
 Rizkalla,* 760 F.2d 1270, 1272, 226 USPQ 224, 225 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (reviews the legislative history of the subsection in a concurring opinion by Judge
 Rich). The first of many to reduce an invention to practice around the same time will
 be the sole party to obtain a patent in some instances, *Radio Corp. of
 America**v.**Radio Eng’g Labs., Inc.,* 293 U.S. 1, 2, 21 USPQ 353, 353-4 (1934),
 unless another was the first to conceive and couple a later-in-time reduction to
 practice with diligence from a time just prior to when the second conceiver entered
 the field to the first conceiver’s reduction to practice. *Hull v.
 Davenport,* 90 F.2d 103, 105, 33 USPQ 506, 508 (CCPA 1937). See the
 priority time charts below illustrating this point. Upon conclusion of an
 interference, subject matter claimed by the losing party that was the basis of the
 interference is rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, unless
 the acts showing prior invention were not in this country.
 


It is noted that **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** requires that
 whoever invents or discovers the claimed invention is the party that must be named as
 the inventor(s) before a parent may be granted. Where it can be shown that an
 applicant has "derived" an invention from another, a rejection under
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is proper if applicable. *Ex parte
 Kusko,* 215 USPQ 972, 974 (Bd. App. 1981) ("most, if not all,
 determinations under **[[pre-AIA] Section 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** involve
 the question of whether one party derived an invention from another"); *Price
 v. Symsek,* 988 F.2d 1187, 1190, 26 USPQ2d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 (Although derivation and priority of invention both focus on inventorship, derivation
 addresses originality, i.e., who invented the subject matter, whereas priority
 focuses on which party invented the subject matter first.). 
 

**II.** **PRIORITY TIME CHARTS**The following priority time charts illustrate the award of invention
 priority in several situations. The time charts apply to interference proceedings and
 are also applicable to declarations or affidavits filed under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** to antedate references which are available as prior art
 under **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or **[102(e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. Note, however, in the
 context of **[37
 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**, an applicant does not have to show that the
 invention was not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed from the time of an actual
 reduction to practice to a constructive reduction to practice because the length of
 time taken to file a patent application after an actual reduction to practice is
 generally of no consequence except in an interference proceeding. *Paulik v.
 Rizkalla,* 760 F.2d 1270, 226 USPQ 224 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See the
 discussion of abandonment, suppression, and concealment in **[MPEP §
 2138.03](s2138.html#d0e207478)**.
 


For purposes of analysis under **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**, the conception and reduction to practice of the
 reference to be antedated are both considered to be on the effective filing date of
 domestic patent or foreign patent or the date of printed publication.
 


In the charts, C = conception, R = reduction to practice (either
 actual or constructive), Ra = actual reduction to practice, Rc = constructive
 reduction to practice, and TD = commencement of diligence.
 


**Example 1**![Priority Time Chart Example 1](graphics/2138_01-1.png)
A is awarded priority in an interference, or antedates B as a
 reference in the context of a declaration or affidavit filed under
 **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**, because A conceived the invention before B and
 constructively reduced the invention to practice before B reduced the invention to
 practice. The same result would be reached if the conception date was the same for
 both inventors A and B. 
 



**Example 2**![Priority Time Chart Example 2](graphics/2138_01-2.png)
A is awarded priority in an interference, or antedates B as a
 reference in the context of a declaration or affidavit filed under
 **[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)**, if A can show reasonable diligence from
 TD (a point just prior to B’s conception) until Rc
 because A conceived the invention before B, and diligently constructively reduced
 the invention to practice even though this was after B reduced the invention to
 practice.
 



**Example 3**![Priority Time Chart Example 3](graphics/2138_01-3.png)
A is awarded priority in an interference in the absence of
 abandonment, suppression, or concealment from Ra to Rc, because A conceived the
 invention before B, actually reduced the invention to practice before B reduced
 the invention to practice, and did not abandon, suppress, or conceal the invention
 after actually reducing the invention to practice and before constructively
 reducing the invention to practice.
 


A antedates B as a reference in the context of a declaration or
 affidavit filed under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** because A
 conceived the invention before B and actually reduced the invention to practice
 before B reduced the invention to practice.
 



**Example 4**![Priority Time Chart Example 4](graphics/2138_01-4.png)
A is awarded priority in an interference if A can show reasonable
 diligence from TD (a point just prior to B’s conception)
 until Ra in the absence of abandonment, suppression, or concealment from Ra to Rc,
 because A conceived the invention before B, diligently actually reduced the
 invention to practice (after B reduced the invention to practice), and did not
 abandon, suppress, or conceal the invention after actually reducing the invention
 to practice and before constructively reducing the invention to practice.
 


A antedates B as a reference in the context of a declaration or
 affidavit filed under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** because A
 conceived the invention before B, and diligently actually reduced the invention to
 practice, even though this was after B reduced the invention to practice.
 


**III.** **37 CFR 1.131 DOES NOT APPLY IN INTERFERENCE PROCEEDINGS**Interference practice operates to the exclusion of *ex
 parte* practice under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** which permits an
 applicant to show an actual date of invention prior to the effective date of a
 reference or activity applied under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, as long as the reference is not a statutory bar under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395)** or a U.S. patent application publication claiming
 the same patentable invention. *Ex parte Standish,* 10 USPQ2d 1454,
 1457 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1988) (An application claim to the "same patentable
 invention" claimed in a domestic patent requires interference rather than an
 affidavit under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** to antedate the patent. The term "same patentable
 invention" encompasses a claim that is either anticipated by or obvious in view of
 the subject matter recited in the patent claim.). Subject matter which is prior art
 under **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302424)** and is subject to an interference is not open to
 further inquiry under **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** during the
 interference proceeding.
 

**IV.** **LOST COUNTS IN AN INTERFERENCE ARE NOT, *PER SE,* STATUTORY
 PRIOR ART**Loss of an interference count alone does not make its subject matter
 statutory prior art to losing party; however, lost count
 subject matter that is available as prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 may be used alone or in combination with other references under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.
 But see *In re Deckler,* 977 F.2d 1449, 24 USPQ2d 1448 (Fed. Cir.
 1992) (Under the principles of *res judicata* and *collateral estoppel,* Deckler was not entitled to claims that were
 patentably indistinguishable from the claim lost in interference even though the
 subject matter of the lost count was not available for use in an obviousness
 rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.).

 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP

 of applications subject to those provisions.]*


An invention is made when there is a conception and a reduction to
 practice. *Dunn v. Ragin,* 50 USPQ 472, 474 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1941).
 Prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is limited to an invention that is made.
 *In re Katz,* 687 F.2d 450, 454, 215 USPQ 14, 17 (CCPA 1982) (the
 publication of an article, alone, is not deemed a constructive reduction to practice,
 and therefore its disclosure does not prove that any invention within the meaning of
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** has ever been made). 
 


Subject matter under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** is
 available only if made in this country. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**.
 *Kondo v. Martel,* 220 USPQ 47 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1983) (acts of
 conception, reduction to practice and diligence must be demonstrated in this country).
 Compare *Colbert v. Lofdahl,* 21 USPQ2d 1068, 1071 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1991) ("[i]f the invention is reduced to practice in a foreign country and
 knowledge of the invention was brought into this country and disclosed to others, the
 inventor can derive no benefit from the work done abroad and such knowledge is merely
 evidence of conception of the invention").
 


 In accordance with **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, a party
 involved in an interference proceeding under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 135](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303239)** or
 **[291](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306203)** may establish a date of invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**. **[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**, as amended by
 GATT (Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994)) and NAFTA (Public Law 103-182, 107
 Stat. 2057 (1993)), provides that an applicant can establish a date of invention in a
 NAFTA member country on or after December 8, 1993 or in WTO member country other than a
 NAFTA member country on or after January 1, 1996. Accordingly, an interference count may
 be won or lost on the basis of establishment of invention by one of the parties in a
 NAFTA or WTO member country, thereby rendering the subject matter of that count
 unpatentable to the other party under the principles of *res judicata*
 and *collateral estoppel,* even though such subject matter is not
 available as statutory prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. See

# 2138.03 "By Another Who Has Not Abandoned, Suppressed, or Concealed It" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies
 to an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination
 of applications subject to those provisions.]*


**[Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** generally makes available as prior art within the meaning
 of **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the prior invention of another who has not abandoned,
 suppressed or concealed it. *In re Bass,* 474 F.2d 1276, 177 USPQ 178
 (CCPA 1973); *In re Suska,* 589 F.2d 527, 200 USPQ 497 (CCPA 1979) (The
 result of applying the suppression and concealment doctrine is that the inventor who did
 not conceal (but was the *de facto* last inventor) is treated legally
 as the first to invent, while the *de facto* first inventor who
 suppressed or concealed is treated as a later inventor. The *de facto*
 first inventor, by his suppression and concealment, lost the right to rely on his actual
 date of invention not only for priority purposes, but also for purposes of avoiding the
 invention of the counts as prior art.).
 


"The courts have consistently held that an invention, though completed,
 is deemed abandoned, suppressed, or concealed if, within a reasonable time after
 completion, no steps are taken to make the invention publicly known. Thus failure to
 file a patent application; to describe the invention in a publicly disseminated
 document; or to use the invention publicly, have been held to constitute abandonment,
 suppression, or concealment." *Correge v. Murphy,* 705 F.2d 1326, 1330,
 217 USPQ 753, 756 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quoting *International Glass Co.**v.**United States,* 408 F.2d 395, 403, 159 USPQ 434, 441 (Ct. Cl. 1968)).
 In *Correge,* an invention was actually reduced to practice, 7 months
 later there was a public disclosure of the invention, and 8 months thereafter a patent
 application was filed. The court held filing a patent application within 1 year of a
 public disclosure is not an unreasonable delay, therefore reasonable diligence must only
 be shown between the date of the actual reduction to practice and the public disclosure
 to avoid the inference of abandonment.
 

**I.** **DURING AN INTERFERENCE PROCEEDING, AN INFERENCE OF SUPPRESSION OR CONCEALMENT
 MAY ARISE FROM DELAY IN FILING PATENT APPLICATION**Once an invention is actually reduced to practice an inventor need
 not rush to file a patent application. *Shindelar v. Holdeman,* 628
 F.2d 1337, 1341, 207 USPQ 112, 116 (CCPA 1980). The length of time taken to file a
 patent application after an actual reduction to practice is generally of no
 consequence except in an interference proceeding. *Paulik v.
 Rizkalla,* 760 F.2d 1270, 1271, 226 USPQ 225, 226 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (suppression or concealment may be deliberate or may arise due to an inference from a
 "too long" delay in filing a patent application). *Peeler v.
 Miller,* 535 F.2d 647, 656, 190 USPQ 117,124 (CCPA 1976) ("mere delay,
 without more, is not sufficient to establish suppression or concealment." "What we
 are deciding here is that Monsanto’s delay is not ‘merely delay’ and that Monsanto's
 justification for the delay is inadequate to overcome the inference of suppression
 created by the excessive delay." The word "mere" does not imply a total absence of a
 limit on the duration of delay. Whether any delay is "mere" is decided only on a
 case-by-case basis.).
 


Where a junior party in an interference relies upon an actual
 reduction to practice to demonstrate first inventorship, and where the hiatus in time
 between the date for the junior party's asserted reduction to practice and the filing
 of its application is unreasonably long, the hiatus may give rise to an inference
 that the junior party in fact suppressed or concealed the invention and the junior
 party will not be allowed to rely upon the earlier actual reduction to practice.
 *Young v. Dworkin,* 489 F.2d 1277, 1280 n.3, 180 USPQ 388, 391
 n.3 (CCPA 1974) (suppression and concealment issues are to be addressed on a
 case-by-case basis). 
 

**II.** **SUPPRESSION OR CONCEALMENT NEED NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO INVENTOR**Suppression or concealment need not be attributed to the inventor.
 *Peeler v. Miller,* 535 F.2d 647, 653-54, 190 USPQ 117, 122 (CCPA
 1976) ("four year delay from the time an inventor … completes his work … and the time
 his assignee-employer files a patent application is, *prima facie,*
 unreasonably long in an interference with a party who filed first"); *Shindelar v. Holdeman,* 628 F.2d 1337, 1341-42, 207 USPQ 112, 116-17
 (CCPA 1980) (A patent attorney’s workload will not preclude a holding of an
 unreasonable delay— the court identified that a total of 3 months was possibly
 excusable in regard to the filing of an application.).
 

**III.** **INFERENCE OF SUPPRESSION OR CONCEALMENT IS REBUTTABLE**Notwithstanding an inference of suppression or concealment due to
 time(s) of inactivity after reduction to practice, the senior party may still prevail
 if the senior party shows renewed activity on the invention that is just prior to the
 junior party’s entry into field coupled with the diligent filing of an application.
 *Lutzker**v.**Plet,* 843 F.2d 1364, 1367-69, 6 USPQ2d 1370, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir.
 1988) (activities directed towards commercialization not sufficient to rebut
 inference); *Holmwood v. Cherpeck,* 2 USPQ2d 1942, 1945 (Bd. Pat.
 App. & Inter. 1986) (the inference of suppression or concealment may be rebutted
 by showing activity directed to perfecting the invention, preparing the application,
 or preparing other compounds within the scope of the generic invention);
 *Engelhardt v. Judd,* 369 F.2d 408, 411, 151 USPQ 732, 735 (CCPA
 1966) ("We recognize that an inventor of a new series of compounds should not be
 forced to file applications piecemeal on each new member as it is synthesized,
 identified and tested for utility. A reasonable amount of time should be allowed for
 completion of the research project on the whole series of new compounds, and a
 further reasonable time period should then be allowed for drafting and filing the
 patent application(s) thereon."); *Bogoslowsky**v.**Huse,* 142 F.2d 75, 77, 61 USPQ 349, 351 (CCPA 1944) (The doctrine
 of suppression and concealment is not applicable to conception without an actual
 reduction to practice.).
 

**IV.** **ABANDONMENT**A finding of suppression or concealment may not amount to a finding
 of abandonment wherein a right to a patent is lost. *Steierman v.
 Connelly,* 197 USPQ 288, 289 (Comm'r Pat. 1976); *Correge v.
 Murphy,* 705 F.2d 1326, 1329, 217 USPQ 753, 755 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (an
 invention cannot be abandoned until it is first reduced to practice).

# 2138.04 "Conception" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is

Conception has been defined as "the complete performance of the mental
 part of the inventive act" and it is "the formation in the mind of the inventor of a
 definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention as it is thereafter
 to be applied in practice…." *Townsend v. Smith,* 36 F.2d 292, 295, 4
 USPQ 269, 271 (CCPA 1929). "[C]onception is established when the invention is made
 sufficiently clear to enable one skilled in the art to reduce it to practice without the
 exercise of extensive experimentation or the exercise of inventive skill."
 *Hiatt v. Ziegler,* 179 USPQ 757, 763 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1973).
 Conception has also been defined as a disclosure of an invention which enables one
 skilled in the art to reduce the invention to a practical form without "exercise of the
 inventive faculty." *Gunter v. Stream,* 573 F.2d 77, 197 USPQ 482 (CCPA
 1978). See also *Coleman v. Dines,* 754 F.2d 353, 224 USPQ 857 (Fed.
 Cir. 1985) (It is settled that in establishing conception a party must show possession
 of every feature recited in the count, and that every limitation of the count must have
 been known to the inventor at the time of the alleged conception. Conception must be
 proved by corroborating evidence.); *Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies
 Inc.,* 802 F. 2d 1367, 1376, 231 USPQ 81, 87 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Conception is
 the "formation in the mind of the inventor, of a definite and permanent idea of the
 complete and operative invention, as it is hereafter to be applied in practice.");
 *Hitzeman v. Rutter,* 243 F.3d 1345, 58 USPQ2d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2001)
 (Inventor’s "hope" that a genetically altered yeast would produce antigen particles
 having the particle size and sedimentation rates recited in the claims did not establish
 conception, since the inventor did not show that he had a "definite and permanent
 understanding" as to whether or how, or a reasonable expectation that, the yeast would
 produce the recited antigen particles.); *Staehelin v. Secher,* 24
 USPQ2d 1513, 1522 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) ("evidence of conception naming only
 one of the actual inventive entity inures to the benefit of and serves as evidence of
 conception by the complete inventive entity").
 

**I.** **CONCEPTION MUST BE DONE IN THE MIND OF THE INVENTOR**The inventor must form a definite and
 permanent idea of the complete and operable invention to establish conception.
 *Bosies v. Benedict,* 27 F.3d 539, 543, 30 USPQ2d 1862, 1865
 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Testimony by a noninventor as to the meaning of a variable of a
 generic compound described in an inventor’s notebook was insufficient as a matter of
 law to establish the meaning of the variable because the testimony was not probative
 of what the inventors conceived.). A person who shares in the conception of a claimed
 invention is a joint inventor of that invention. *In re VerHoef,*
 888 F.3d 1362, 1366-67, 126 F.2d 1561, 1564-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018).
 

**II.** **CONCEPTION REQUIRES CONTEMPORANEOUS RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF THE
 INVENTION**There must be a contemporaneous recognition and appreciation of the
 invention for there to be conception. *Silvestri v. Grant,* 496 F.2d
 593, 596, 181 USPQ 706, 708 (CCPA 1974) ("an accidental and unappreciated duplication
 of an invention does not defeat the patent right of one who, though later in time was
 the first to recognize that which constitutes the inventive subject matter");
 *Invitrogen,**Corp. v. Clontech Laboratories, Inc.,* 429 F.3d 1052, 1064,
 77 USPQ2d 1161, 1169 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (In situations where there is unrecognized
 accidental duplication, establishing conception requires evidence that the inventor
 actually made the invention and understood the invention to have the features that
 comprise the inventive subject matter at issue).*Langer v. Kaufman,*
 465 F.2d 915, 918, 175 USPQ 172, 174 (CCPA 1972) (new form of catalyst was not
 recognized when it was first produced; conception cannot be established *nunc
 pro tunc*). However, an inventor does not need to know that the invention
 will work for there to be complete conception. *Burroughs Wellcome Co. v.
 Barr Labs., Inc.,* 40 F.3d 1223, 1228, 32 USPQ2d 1915, 1919 (Fed. Cir.
 1994) (Draft patent application disclosing treatment of AIDS with AZT reciting
 dosages, forms, and routes of administration was sufficient to collaborate conception
 whether or not the inventors believed the inventions would work based on initial
 screening tests.) Furthermore, the inventor does not need to appreciate the
 patentability of the invention. *Dow Chem. Co. v. Astro-Valcour,
 Inc.,* 267 F.3d 1334, 1341, 60 USPQ2d 1519, 1523 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
 


The first to conceive of a species is not necessarily the first to
 conceive of the generic invention. *In re Jolley,* 308 F.3d 1317,
 1323 n.2, 64 USPQ2d 1901, 1905 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Further, while conception of a
 species within a genus may constitute conception of the genus, conception of one
 species and the genus may not constitute conception of another species in the genus.
 *Oka v. Youssefyeh,* 849 F.2d 581, 7 USPQ2d 1169 (Fed. Cir. 1988)
 (conception of a chemical requires both the idea of the structure of the chemical and
 possession of an operative method of making it). See also *Amgen, Inc. v.
 Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.,* 927 F.2d 1200, 1206, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1021
 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (in the isolation of a gene, defining a gene by its principal
 biological property is not sufficient for conception absent an ability to envision
 the detailed constitution as well as a method for obtaining it); *Fiers v.
 Revel,* 984 F.2d 1164, 1170, 25 USPQ2d 1601, 1605 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 ("[b]efore reduction to practice, conception only of a process for making a
 substance, without conception of a structural or equivalent definition of that
 substance, can at most constitute a conception of the substance claimed as a process"
 but cannot constitute conception of the substance; as "conception is not enablement,"
 conception of a purified DNA sequence coding for a specific protein by function and a
 method for its isolation that could be carried out by one of ordinary skill in the
 art is not conception of that material). See **[MPEP §§
 2106.04(b)](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c)** and **[2106.04(c)](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1)** for information on the subject matter
 eligibility of inventions involving isolated genes.
 


On rare occasions conception and reduction to practice occur
 simultaneously in unpredictable technologies. *Alpert v. Slatin,*
 305 F.2d 891, 894, 134 USPQ 296, 299 (CCPA 1962). "[I]n some unpredictable areas of
 chemistry and biology, there is no conception until the invention has been reduced to
 practice." *MacMillan v.**Moffett,* 432 F.2d 1237, 1234-40, 167 USPQ 550, 552-553 (CCPA
 1970). See also *Hitzeman v. Rutter,* 243 F.3d 1345, 58 USPQ2d 1161
 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (conception simultaneous with reduction to practice where appellant
 lacked reasonable certainty that yeast’s performance of certain intracellular
 processes would result in the claimed antigen particles); *Dunn v.
 Ragin,* 50 USPQ 472, 475 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1941) (a new variety of
 asexually reproduced plant is conceived and reduced to practice when it is grown and
 recognized as a new variety). Under these circumstances, conception is not complete
 if subsequent experimentation reveals factual uncertainty which "so undermines the
 specificity of the inventor’s idea that it is not yet a definite and permanent
 reflection of the complete invention as it will be used in practice."
 *Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc.,* 40 F.3d 1223, 1229,
 32 USPQ2d 1915, 1920 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
 

**III.** **A PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED APPLICATION WHICH WAS NOT COPENDING WITH A SUBSEQUENT
 APPLICATION IS EVIDENCE ONLY OF CONCEPTION**An abandoned application with which no subsequent application was
 copending serves to abandon benefit of the application’s filing as a constructive
 reduction to practice and the abandoned application is evidence only of conception.
 *In re Costello,* 717 F.2d 1346, 1350, 219 USPQ 389, 392 (Fed.
 Cir. 1983).

# 2138.05 "Reduction to Practice" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies
 to an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination
 of applications subject to those provisions.]*


Reduction to practice may be an actual reduction or a constructive
 reduction to practice which occurs when a patent application on the claimed invention is
 filed. The filing of a patent application serves as conception and constructive
 reduction to practice of the subject matter described in the application. Thus the
 inventor need not provide evidence of either conception or actual reduction to practice
 when relying on the content of the patent application. *Hyatt v.
 Boone,* 146 F.3d 1348, 1352, 47 USPQ2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1998). A
 reduction to practice can be done by another on behalf of the inventor. *De
 Solms v.**Schoenwald,* 15 USPQ2d 1507, 1510 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990).
 "While the filing of the original application theoretically constituted a constructive
 reduction to practice at the time, the subsequent abandonment of that application also
 resulted in an abandonment of the benefit of that filing as a constructive reduction to
 practice. The filing of the original application is, however, evidence of conception of
 the invention." *In re Costello,* 717 F.2d 1346, 1350, 219 USPQ 389,
 392 (Fed. Cir. 1983)(The second application was not co-pending with the original
 application and it did not reference the original application. Because of the
 requirements of **[35
 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** had not been satisfied, the filing of the original
 application was not recognized as constructive reduction to practice of the
 invention.).
 

**I.** **CONSTRUCTIVE REDUCTION TO PRACTICE REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH 35 U.S.C. 112(a)
 or PRE-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, FIRST PARAGRAPH**When a party to an interference seeks the benefit of an
 earlier-filed U.S. patent application, the earlier application must meet the
 requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)** and **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph for the subject matter of the count. The earlier application must meet the
 enablement requirement and must contain a written description of the subject matter
 of the interference count. *Hyatt v. Boone,* 146 F.3d 1348, 1352,
 47 USPQ2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Proof of a constructive reduction to practice
 requires sufficient disclosure under the "how to use" and "how to make" requirements
 of **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. *Kawai v. Metlesics,* 480 F.2d 880, 886, 178 USPQ 158,
 163 (CCPA 1973) (A constructive reduction to practice is not proven unless the
 specification discloses a practical utility where one would not be obvious. Prior art
 which disclosed an anticonvulsant compound which differed from the claimed compound
 only in the absence of a -CH2- group connecting two functional
 groups was not sufficient to establish utility of the claimed compound because the
 compounds were not so closely related that they could be presumed to have the same
 utility.). The purpose of the written description requirement is "to ensure that the
 inventor had possession, as of the filing date of the application relied on, of the
 specific subject matter later claimed by him." *In re Edwards,* 568
 F.2d 1349, 1351-52, 196 USPQ 465, 467 (CCPA 1978). The written description must
 include all of the limitations of the interference count, or the applicant must show
 that any absent text is necessarily comprehended in the description provided and
 would have been so understood at the time the patent application was filed.
 Furthermore, the written description must be sufficient, when the entire
 specification is considered, such that the "necessary and only reasonable
 construction" that would be given it by a person skilled in the art is one that
 clearly supports each positive limitation in the count. *Hyatt v.
 Boone,* 146 F.3d at 1354-55, 47 USPQ2d at 1130-1132 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The
 claim could be read as describing subject matter other than that of the count and
 thus did not establish that the applicant was in possession of the invention of the
 count.). See also *Bigham v. Godtfredsen,* 857 F.2d 1415, 1417,
 8 USPQ2d 1266, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("[t]he generic term halogen comprehends a
 limited number of species, and ordinarily constitutes a sufficient written
 description of the common halogen species," except where the halogen species are
 patentably distinct). 
 

**II.** **REQUIREMENTS TO ESTABLISH ACTUAL REDUCTION TO PRACTICE** "In an interference proceeding, a party seeking to establish an
 actual reduction to practice must satisfy a two-prong test: (1) the party constructed
 an embodiment or performed a process that met every element of the interference
 count, and (2) the embodiment or process operated for its intended purpose."
 *Eaton v. Evans,* 204 F.3d 1094, 1097, 53 USPQ2d 1696, 1698 (Fed.
 Cir. 2000).
 


The same evidence sufficient for a constructive reduction to
 practice may be insufficient to establish an actual reduction to practice, which
 requires a showing of the invention in a physical or tangible form that shows every
 element of the count. *Wetmore v. Quick,* 536 F.2d 937, 942, 190
 USPQ 223, 227 (CCPA 1976). For an actual reduction to practice, the invention must
 have been sufficiently tested to demonstrate that it will work for its intended
 purpose, but it need not be in a commercially satisfactory stage of development. See,
 e.g., *Scott v. Finney,* 34 F.3d 1058, 1062, 32 USPQ2d 1115, 1118-19
 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citing numerous cases wherein the character of the testing
 necessary to support an actual reduction to practice varied with the complexity of
 the invention and the problem it solved). If a device is so simple, and its purpose
 and efficacy so obvious, construction alone is sufficient to demonstrate workability.
 *King Instrument Corp. v. Otari Corp.,* 767 F.2d 853, 860, 226
 USPQ 402, 407 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
 


For additional cases pertaining to the requirements necessary to
 establish actual reduction to practice see *DSL Dynamic Sciences, Ltd. v.
 Union Switch & Signal, Inc.,* 928 F.2d 1122, 1126, 18 USPQ2d 1152,
 1155 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("events occurring after an alleged actual reduction to
 practice can call into question whether reduction to practice has in fact occurred");
 *Fitzgerald v. Arbib,* 268 F.2d 763, 765-66, 122 USPQ 530, 531-32
 (CCPA 1959) ("the reduction to practice of a three-dimensional design invention
 requires the production of an article embodying that design" in "other than a mere
 drawing"); *Birmingham v. Randall,* 171 F.2d 957, 80 USPQ 371, 372
 (CCPA 1948) (To establish an actual reduction to practice of an invention directed to
 a method of making a product, it is not enough to show that the method was performed.
 "[S]uch an invention is not reduced to practice until it is established that the
 product made by the process is satisfactory, and [ ] this may require successful
 testing of the product."). 
 

**III.** **TESTING REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AN ACTUAL REDUCTION TO PRACTICE**"The nature of testing which is required to establish a reduction to
 practice depends on the particular facts of each case, especially the nature of the
 invention." *Gellert v. Wanberg,* 495 F.2d 779, 783, 181 USPQ 648,
 652 (CCPA 1974) ("an invention may be tested sufficiently … where less than all of
 the conditions of actual use are duplicated by the tests"); *Wells v.
 Fremont,* 177 USPQ 22, 24-5 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1972) ("even where tests are
 conducted under ‘bench’ or laboratory conditions, those conditions must ‘fully
 duplicate each and every condition of actual use’ or if they do not, then the
 evidence must establish a relationship between the subject matter, the test condition
 and the intended functional setting of the invention," but it is not required that
 all the conditions of all actual uses be duplicated, such as rain, snow, mud, dust
 and submersion in water). 
 

**IV.** **REDUCTION TO PRACTICE REQUIRES RECOGNITION AND APPRECIATION OF THE
 INVENTION**The invention must be recognized and appreciated for a reduction to
 practice to occur. "The rule that conception and reduction to practice cannot be
 established nunc pro tunc simply requires that in order for an experiment to
 constitute an actual reduction to practice, there must have been contemporaneous
 appreciation of the invention at issue by the inventor…. Subsequent testing or later
 recognition may not be used to show that a party had contemporaneous appreciation of
 the invention. However, evidence of subsequent testing may be admitted for the
 purpose of showing that an embodiment was produced and that it met the limitations of
 the count." *Cooper v. Goldfarb,* 154 F.3d 1321, 1331, 47 USPQ2d
 1896, 1904 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). *Meitzner v.
 Corte,* 537 F.2d 524, 528, 190 USPQ 407, 410 (CCPA 1976) (there can be no
 conception or reduction to practice of a new form or of a process using such a new
 form of an otherwise old composition where there has been no recognition or
 appreciation of the existence of the new form); *Estee Lauder, Inc. v.
 L’Oreal S.A.,* 129 F.3d 588, 593, 44 USPQ2d 1610, 1615 (Fed. Cir. 1997)
 ("[W]hen testing is necessary to establish utility, there must be recognition and
 appreciation that the tests were successful for reduction to practice to occur." A
 showing that testing was completed before the critical date, and that testing
 ultimately proved successful, was held insufficient to establish a reduction to
 practice before the critical date, since the success of the testing was not
 appreciated or recognized until after the critical date.); *Parker v.
 Frilette,* 462 F.2d 544, 547, 174 USPQ 321, 324 (CCPA 1972) ("[an]
 inventor need not understand precisely why his invention works in order to achieve an
 actual reduction to practice"). 
 

**V.** **RECOGNITION OF THE INVENTION BY ANOTHER MAY INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE
 INVENTOR** "Inurement involves a claim by an inventor that, as a matter of
 law, the acts of another person should accrue to the benefit of the inventor."
 *Cooper v. Goldfarb,* 154 F.3d 1321, 1331, 47 USPQ2d 1896, 1904
 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Before a non-inventor’s recognition of the utility of the invention
 can inure to the benefit of the inventor, the following three-prong test must be met:
 (1) the inventor must have conceived of the invention, (2) the inventor must have had
 an expectation that the embodiment tested would work for the intended purpose of the
 invention, and (3) the inventor must have submitted the embodiment for testing for
 the intended purpose of the invention. *Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron
 Corp.,* 220 F.3d 1345, 1354, 55 USPQ2d 1636, 1643 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In
 *Genentech,* a non-inventor hired by the inventors to test yeast
 samples for the presence of the fusion protein encoded by the DNA construct of the
 invention recognized the growth-enhancing property of the fusion protein, but did not
 communicate this recognition to the inventors. The court found that because the
 inventors did not submit the samples for testing growth-promoting activity, the
 intended purpose of the invention, the third prong was not satisfied and the
 uncommunicated recognition of the activity of the fusion protein by the non-inventor
 did not inure to the benefit of the inventor. See also *Cooper v.
 Goldfarb,* 240 F.3d 1378, 1385, 57 USPQ2d 1990, 1995 (Fed. Cir. 2001)
 (Cooper sent to Goldfarb samples of a material for use in vascular grafts. At the
 time the samples were sent, Cooper was unaware of the importance of the fibril length
 of the material. Cooper did not at any time later convey to, or request from,
 Goldfarb any information regarding fibril length. Therefore, Goldfarb’s determination
 of the fibril lengths of the material could not inure to Cooper’s benefit.). 
 

**VI.** **IN AN INTERFERENCE PROCEEDING, ALL LIMITATIONS OF A COUNT MUST BE REDUCED TO
 PRACTICE**The device reduced to practice must include every limitation of the
 count. *Fredkin v. Irasek,* 397 F.2d 342, 158 USPQ 280, 285 (CCPA
 1968); every limitation in a count is material and must be proved to establish an
 actual reduction to practice.  *Meitzner v. Corte,* 537 F.2d 524,
 528, 190 USPQ 407, 410 (CCPA 1976). See also *Hull v. Bonis,* 214
 USPQ 731, 734 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1982) (no doctrine of equivalents—remedy is a
 preliminary motion to amend the count to conform to the proofs). 
 

**VII.** **CLAIMED INVENTION IS NOT ACTUALLY REDUCED TO PRACTICE UNLESS THERE IS A KNOWN
 UTILITY**Utility for the invention must be known at the time of the reduction
 to practice. *Wiesner v. Weigert,* 666 F.2d 582, 588, 212 USPQ 721,
 726 (CCPA 1981) (except for plant and design inventions); *Azar v.
 Burns,* 188 USPQ 601, 604 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1975) (a composition and a
 method cannot be actually reduced to practice unless the composition and the product
 produced by the method have a practical utility);  *Ciric v.
 Flanigen,* 511 F.2d 1182, 1185, 185 USPQ 103, 105-6 (CCPA 1975) ("when a
 count does not recite any particular utility, evidence establishing a substantial
 utility for any purpose is sufficient to prove a reduction to practice"; "the
 demonstrated similarity of ion exchange and adsorptive properties between the newly
 discovered zeolites and known crystalline zeolites … have established utility for the
 zeolites of the count"); *Engelhardt v. Judd,* 369 F.2d 408, 411,
 151 USPQ 732, 735 (CCPA 1966) (When considering an actual reduction to practice as a
 bar to patentability for claims to compounds, it is sufficient to successfully
 demonstrate utility of the compounds in animals for somewhat different pharmaceutical
 purposes than those asserted in the specification for humans.); *Rey-Bellet
 v. Engelhardt,* 493 F.2d 1380, 1384, 181 USPQ 453, 455 (CCPA 1974) (Two
 categories of tests on laboratory animals have been considered adequate to show
 utility and reduction to practice: first, tests carried out to prove utility in
 humans where there is a satisfactory correlation between humans and animals, and
 second, tests carried out to prove utility for treating animals.).
 

**VIII.** **A PROBABLE UTILITY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH UTILITY**A probable utility does not establish a practical utility, which is
 established by actual testing or where the utility can be "foretold with certainty."
 *Bindra v. Kelly,* 206 USPQ 570, 575 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1979)
 (Reduction to practice was not established for an intermediate useful in the
 preparation of a second intermediate with a known utility in the preparation of a
 pharmaceutical. The record established there was a high degree of probability of a
 successful preparation because one skilled in the art may have been motivated, in the
 sense of **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, to prepare the second intermediate from the first
 intermediate. However, a strong probability of utility is not sufficient to establish
 practical utility.); *Wu v. Jucker,* 167 USPQ 467, 472 (Bd. Pat.
 Inter. 1968) (screening test where there was an indication of possible utility is
 insufficient to establish practical utility). But see *Nelson v.
 Bowler,* 628 F.2d 853, 858, 206 USPQ 881, 885 (CCPA 1980) (Relevant
 evidence is judged as a whole for its persuasiveness in linking observed properties
 to suggested uses. Reasonable correlation between the two is sufficient for an actual
 reduction to practice.).

# 2138.06 "Reasonable Diligence" [R-10.2019]


*[Editor Note: This MPEP section **has limited applicability** to
 applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF)
 provisions of the AIA as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**. See
 **[MPEP
 § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** et seq. to determine whether an application is
 subject to examination under the FITF provisions, **[MPEP §
 2159.03](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_13adb_2f9)** for the conditions under which this section applies
 to an AIA application, and **[MPEP § 2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** et seq. for examination
 of applications subject to those provisions.]*


The diligence of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** relates to
 reasonable "attorney-diligence" and "engineering-diligence" *(Keizer v.
 Bradley,* 270 F.2d 396, 397, 123 USPQ 215, 216 (CCPA 1959)), which does not
 require that "an inventor or his attorney … drop all other work and concentrate on the
 particular invention involved…." *Emery v. Ronden,* 188 USPQ 264, 268
 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1974). 
 

**I.** **CRITICAL PERIOD FOR ESTABLISHING DILIGENCE BETWEEN ONE WHO WAS FIRST TO
 CONCEIVE BUT LATER TO REDUCE TO PRACTICE**The critical period for diligence for a first conceiver but second
 reducer begins not at the time of conception of the first conceiver but just prior to
 the entry in the field of the party who was first to reduce to practice and continues
 until the first conceiver reduces to practice. *Hull v. Davenport,*
 90 F.2d 103, 105, 33 USPQ 506, 508 (CCPA 1937) ("lack of diligence from the time of
 conception to the time immediately preceding the conception date of the second
 conceiver is not regarded as of importance except as it may have a bearing upon his
 subsequent acts"). What serves as the entry date into the field of a first reducer is
 dependent upon what is being relied on by the first reducer, e.g., conception plus
 reasonable diligence to reduction to practice *(Fritsch v. Lin,* 21
 USPQ2d 1731, 1734 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991), *Emery v.
 Ronden,* 188 USPQ 264, 268 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1974)); an actual reduction
 to practice or a constructive reduction to practice by the filing of either a U.S.
 application *(Rebstock v. Flouret,* 191 USPQ 342, 345 (Bd. Pat.
 Inter. 1975)) or reliance upon priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** of a foreign
 application *(Justus v. Appenzeller,* 177 USPQ 332, 339 (Bd. Pat.
 Inter. 1971) (chain of priorities under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** and
 **[120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)** denied for failure
 to supply certified copy of the foreign application during pendency of the
 application that was filed within the twelve month period prescribed by
 **[35 U.S.C.
 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**)). 
 

**II.** **THE ENTIRE PERIOD DURING WHICH DILIGENCE IS REQUIRED MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY
 EITHER AFFIRMATIVE ACTS OR ACCEPTABLE EXCUSES**"A patent owner need not prove the inventor
 *continuously* exercised reasonable diligence throughout the
 critical period; it must show there was *reasonably continuous*
 diligence." *Perfect Surgical Techniques, Inc. v. Olympus Am.,
 Inc.,* 841 F.3d 1004, 1009, 120 USPQ2d 1605, 1609 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
 (emphasis in original) (citing *Tyco Healthcare Grp. v. Ethicon EndoSurgery,
 Inc.,* 774 F.3d 968, 975, 112 USPQ2d 1979 (Fed. Cir. 2014) and
 *Monsanto Co. v. Mycogen Plant Sci., Inc.,* 261 F.3d 1356, 1370,
 59 USPQ2d 1930, 1939 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).
 


An applicant must account for the entire period during which
 diligence is required. *Gould v. Schawlow,* 363 F.2d 908, 919, 150
 USPQ 634, 643 (CCPA 1966) (Merely stating that there were no weeks or months that the
 invention was not worked on is not enough.); *In re Harry,* 333 F.2d
 920, 923, 142 USPQ 164, 166 (CCPA 1964) (statement that the subject matter "was
 diligently reduced to practice" is not a showing but a mere pleading). A 2-day period
 lacking activity has been held to be fatal. *In re Mulder,* 716 F.2d
 1542, 1545, 219 USPQ 189, 193 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (**[37 CFR
 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** issue); *Fitzgerald v. Arbib,* 268 F.2d
 763, 766, 122 USPQ 530, 532 (CCPA 1959) (Less than 1 month of inactivity during the
 critical period shows a lack of diligence. Efforts to exploit an invention
 commercially do not constitute diligence in reducing it to practice. An actual
 reduction to practice in the case of a design for a three-dimensional article
 requires that it should be embodied in some structure other than a mere drawing.);
 *Kendall v. Searles,* 173 F.2d 986, 993, 81 USPQ 363, 369 (CCPA
 1949) (Evidence of diligence must be specific as to dates and facts.). 
 


The period during which diligence is required must be accounted for
 by either affirmative acts or acceptable excuses. *Rebstock v.
 Flouret,* 191 USPQ 342, 345 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1975); *Rieser v.
 Williams,* 225 F.2d 419, 423, 118 USPQ 96, 100 (CCPA 1958) (Being last to
 reduce to practice, party cannot prevail unless he has shown that he was first to
 conceive and that he exercised reasonable diligence during the critical period from
 just prior to opponent’s entry into the field); *Griffith v.
 Kanamaru,* 816 F.2d 624, 2 USPQ2d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Court generally
 reviewed cases on excuses for inactivity including vacation extended by ill health
 and daily job demands, and held lack of university funding and personnel are not
 acceptable excuses.); *Litchfield v. Eigen,* 535 F.2d 72, 190 USPQ
 113 (CCPA 1976) (budgetary limits and availability of animals for testing not
 sufficiently described); *Morway v. Bondi,* 203 F.2d 741, 749, 97
 USPQ 318, 323 (CCPA 1953) (voluntarily laying aside inventive concept in pursuit of
 other projects is generally not an acceptable excuse although there may be
 circumstances creating exceptions); *Anderson v. Crowther,* 152 USPQ
 504, 512 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1965) (preparation of routine periodic reports covering all
 accomplishments of the laboratory insufficient to show diligence); *Wu v.
 Jucker,* 167 USPQ 467, 472-73 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1968) (applicant
 improperly allowed test data sheets to accumulate to a sufficient amount to justify
 interfering with equipment then in use on another project); *Tucker v.
 Natta,* 171 USPQ 494,498 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1971) ("[a]ctivity directed
 toward the reduction to practice of a genus does not establish, *prima
 facie,* diligence toward the reduction to practice of a species embraced
 by said genus"); *Justus v. Appenzeller,* 177 USPQ 332, 340-1 (Bd.
 Pat. Inter. 1971) (Although it is possible that patentee could have reduced the
 invention to practice in a shorter time by relying on stock items rather than by
 designing a particular piece of hardware, patentee exercised reasonable diligence to
 secure the required hardware to actually reduce the invention to practice. "[I]n
 deciding the question of diligence it is immaterial that the inventor may not have
 taken the expeditious course….").
 


Examiners should weigh the body of evidence to make
 the determination of whether there was reasonably continuous diligence for the entire
 critical period. This determination should be made with the purpose of the diligence
 requirement in mind, which "is to assure that, in light of the evidence as a whole,
 ‘the invention as not abandoned or unreasonably delayed.’" *Perfect Surgical
 Techniques, Inc. v. Olympus Am., Inc.* (*Perfect
 Surgical*), 841 F.3d 1004, 1009, 120 USPQ2d 1605, 1609 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
 (citations omitted). In *Perfect Surgical*, the Federal Circuit
 stated:
 




> 
> Under this standard, an inventor is not
>  required to work on reducing his invention to practice every day during the
>  critical period. … And periods of inactivity within the critical period do not
>  automatically vanquish a patent owner's claim of reasonable diligence…. In
>  determining whether an invention antedates another, the point of the diligence
>  analysis is not to scour the patent owner's corroborating evidence in search of
>  intervals of time where the patent owner has failed to substantiate some sort
>  of activity. It is to assure that, in light of the evidence as a whole, "the
>  invention was not abandoned or unreasonably delayed." ... That an inventor
>  overseeing a study did not record its progress on a daily, weekly, or even
>  monthly basis does not mean the inventor necessarily abandoned his invention or
>  unreasonably delayed it. The same logic applies to the preparation of a patent
>  application: the absence of evidence that an inventor and his attorney revised
>  or discussed the application on a daily basis is alone insufficient to
>  determine that the invention was abandoned or unreasonably delayed. One must

**III.** **WORK RELIED UPON TO SHOW REASONABLE DILIGENCE MUST BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE
 REDUCTION TO PRACTICE**The work relied upon to show reasonable diligence must be directly
 related to the reduction to practice of the invention in issue. *Naber v.
 Cricchi,* 567 F.2d 382, 384, 196 USPQ 294, 296 (CCPA 1977),
 *cert. denied,* 439 U.S. 826 (1978). See also *Scott v.
 Koyama,* 281 F.3d 1243, 1248-49, 61 USPQ2d 1856, 1859 (Fed. Cir. 2002)
 (Activities directed at building a plant to practice the claimed process of producing
 tetrafluoroethane on a large scale constituted efforts toward actual reduction to
 practice, and thus were evidence of diligence. The court distinguished cases where
 diligence was not found because inventors either discontinued development or failed
 to complete the invention while pursuing financing or other commercial activity.);
 *In re Jolley,* 308 F.3d 1317, 1326-27, 64 USPQ2d 1901, 1908-09
 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (diligence found based on research and procurement activities
 related to the subject matter of the interference count). "[U]nder some circumstances
 an inventor should also be able to rely on work on closely related inventions as
 support for diligence toward the reduction to practice on an invention in issue."
 *Ginos v. Nedelec,* 220 USPQ 831, 836 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1983)
 (work on other closely related compounds that were considered to be part of the same
 invention and which were included as part of a grandparent application). "The work
 relied upon must be directed to attaining a reduction to practice of the subject
 matter of the counts. It is not sufficient that the activity relied on concerns
 related subject matter." *Gunn v. Bosch,* 181 USPQ 758, 761 (Bd.
 Pat. Inter. 1973) (An actual reduction to practice of the invention at issue which
 occurred when the inventor was working on a different invention "was fortuitous, and
 not the result of a continuous intent or effort to reduce to practice the invention
 here in issue. Such fortuitousness is inconsistent with the exercise of diligence
 toward reduction to practice of that invention." 181 USPQ at 761. Furthermore,
 evidence drawn towards work on improvement of samples or specimens generally already
 in use at the time of conception that are but one element of the oscillator circuit
 of the count does not show diligence towards the construction and testing of the
 overall combination.); *Broos v. Barton,* 142 F.2d 690, 691, 61 USPQ
 447, 448 (CCPA 1944) (preparation of application in U.S. for foreign filing
 constitutes diligence); *De Solms v. Schoenwald,* 15 USPQ2d 1507
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990) (principles of diligence must be given to
 inventor’s circumstances including skill and time; requirement of corroboration
 applies only to testimony of inventor); *Huelster v. Reiter,* 168
 F.2d 542, 78 USPQ 82 (CCPA 1948) (if inventor was not able to make an actual
 reduction to practice of the invention, he must also show why he was not able to
 constructively reduce the invention to practice by the filing of an application).
 

**IV.** **DILIGENCE REQUIRED IN PREPARING AND FILING PATENT APPLICATION**The diligence of attorney in preparing and filing patent application
 inures to the benefit of the inventor. Conception was established at least as early
 as the date a draft of a patent application was finished by a patent attorney on
 behalf of the inventor. Conception is less a matter of signature than it is one of
 disclosure. Attorney does not prepare a patent application on behalf of particular
 named persons, but on behalf of the true inventive entity. Six days to execute and
 file application is acceptable. *Haskell v. Coleburne,* 671 F.2d
 1362, 213 USPQ 192, 195 (CCPA 1982). See also *Bey v. Kollonitsch,*
 806 F.2d 1024, 231 USPQ 967 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Reasonable diligence is all that is
 required of the attorney. Reasonable diligence is established if attorney worked
 reasonably hard on the application during the continuous critical period. If the
 attorney has a reasonable backlog of unrelated cases which the attorney takes up in
 chronological order and carries out expeditiously, that is sufficient. Work on a
 related case(s) that contributed substantially to the ultimate preparation of an
 application can be credited as diligence.). In "the preparation" of a patent
 application, "the absence of evidence that an inventor and his attorney revised or
 discussed the application on a daily basis is alone insufficient to determine that
 the invention was abandoned or unreasonably delayed." *Perfect Surgical
 Techniques, Inc. v. Olympus Am., Inc.,* 841 F.3d 1004, 1009, 120 USPQ2d
 1605, 1609 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 
 

**V.** **END OF DILIGENCE PERIOD IS MARKED BY EITHER ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE REDUCTION
 TO PRACTICE**"[I]t is of no moment that the end of that period [for diligence] is
 fixed by a constructive, rather than an actual, reduction to practice."
 *Justus v. Appenzeller,* 177 USPQ 332, 340-41 (Bd. Pat. Inter.
 1971).
