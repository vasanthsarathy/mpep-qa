# 2125 Drawings as Prior Art [R-10.2019]

**I.** **DRAWINGS CAN BE USED AS PRIOR ART**Drawings and pictures can anticipate claims if they clearly show the
 structure which is claimed. *In re Mraz,* 455 F.2d 1069, 173 USPQ 25
 (CCPA 1972). However, the picture must show all the claimed structural features and how
 they are put together. *Jockmus v. Leviton,* 28 F.2d 812 (2d Cir.
 1928). The origin of the drawing is immaterial. For instance, drawings in a design
 patent can anticipate or make obvious the claimed invention as can drawings in utility
 patents. When the reference is a utility patent, it does not matter that the feature
 shown is unintended or unexplained in the specification. The drawings must be evaluated
 for what they reasonably disclose and suggest to one of ordinary skill in the art.
 *In re Aslanian,* 590 F.2d 911, 200 USPQ 500 (CCPA 1979). See
 **[MPEP §
 2121.04](s2121.html#d0e201980)** for more information on prior art drawings as "enabled
 disclosures."
 

**II.** **PROPORTIONS OF FEATURES IN A DRAWING ARE NOT EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL PROPORTIONS WHEN
 DRAWINGS ARE NOT TO SCALE**When the reference does not disclose that the drawings are to scale and
 is silent as to dimensions, arguments based on measurement of the drawing features are
 of little value. See *Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc. v. Avia Group Int’l,*
 222 F.3d 951, 956, 55 USPQ2d 1487, 1491 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (The disclosure gave no
 indication that the drawings were drawn to scale. "[I]t is well established that patent
 drawings do not define the precise proportions of the elements and may not be relied on
 to show particular sizes if the specification is completely silent on the issue.").
 However, the description of the article pictured can be relied on, in combination with
 the drawings, for what they would reasonably teach one of ordinary skill in the art.
 *In re Wright,* 569 F.2d 1124, 1127-28, 193 USPQ 332, 335-36 (CCPA
 1977) ("We disagree with the Solicitor’s conclusion, reached by a comparison of the
 relative dimensions of appellant’s and Bauer’s [the reference's] drawing figures, that
 Bauer ‘clearly points to the use of a chime length of roughly 1/2 to 1 inch for a
 whiskey barrel.’ This ignores the fact that Bauer does not disclose that his drawings
 are to scale. ... However, we agree with the Solicitor that Bauer’s teaching that
 whiskey losses are influenced by the distance the liquor needs to ‘traverse the pores of
 the wood’ (albeit in reference to the thickness of the barrelhead)" would have suggested
 the desirability of an increased chime length to one of ordinary skill in the art bent
 on further reducing whiskey losses." 569 F.2d at 1127, 193 USPQ at 335-36.)
