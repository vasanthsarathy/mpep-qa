# 2122 Discussion of Utility in the Prior Art [R-08.2017]

**UTILITY NEED NOT BE DISCLOSED IN REFERENCE**In order to constitute anticipatory prior art, a reference must
 identically disclose the claimed compound, but no utility need be disclosed by the
 reference. *In re**Schoenwald,* 964 F.2d 1122, 1124, 22 USPQ2d 1671, 1673 (Fed. Cir.
 1992) (The application claimed compounds used in ophthalmic compositions to treat dry
 eye syndrome. The examiner found a printed publication which disclosed the claimed
 compound but did not disclose a use for the compound. The court found that the claim was
 anticipated since the compound and a process of making it was taught by the reference.
 The court explained that "no utility need be disclosed for a reference to be
 anticipatory of a claim to an old compound." It is enough that the claimed compound is
 taught by the reference.). See also *Impax Labs. Inc. v. Aventis Pharm.
 Inc.,* 468 F.3d 1366, 1383, 81 USPQ2d 1001, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[P]roof
 of efficacy is not required for a prior art reference to be enabling for purposes of
 anticipation.").
