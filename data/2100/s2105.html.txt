# 2105 Patent Eligible Subject Matter — Living Subject Matter [R-10.2019]

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**Prior to 1980, it was widely believed that living subject matter was
 not eligible for patenting, either because such subject matter did not fall within a
 statutory category, or because it was a judicial exception to patent eligibility.
 However, the decision of the Supreme Court in *Diamond v. Chakrabarty,*
 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980), made it clear that the question of whether an
 invention embraces living matter is irrelevant to the issue of patent eligibility. Note,
 however, that Congress has excluded claims directed to or encompassing a human organism
 from eligibility. See The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), Pub. L. 112-29, sec.
 33(a), 125 Stat. 284 (September 16, 2011).
 

**II.** **LIVING SUBJECT MATTER MAY BE PATENT ELIGIBLE*** 

***A.*** ***Living Subject Matter May Be Directed To A Statutory Category*** In *Chakrabarty,* the Supreme Court held that a
 claim to a genetically engineered bacterium was directed to at least one of the four
 statutory categories, because the bacterium was a "manufacture" and/or a "composition
 of matter." In its opinion, the Court stated that "Congress plainly contemplated that
 the patent laws would be given wide scope" because it chose to draft
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** using "such expansive terms as ‘manufacture’ and
 ‘composition of matter,’ modified by the comprehensive ‘any.’" 447 U.S. at 308, 206
 USPQ at 197. The Court also determined that the distinction between living and
 inanimate things was not relevant for subject matter eligibility. 447 U.S. at 313,
 206 USPQ at 199. Thus, the Court held that living subject matter with markedly
 different characteristics from any found in nature, such as the claimed bacterium
 produced by genetic engineering, is not excluded from patent protection by
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. 447 U.S. at 310, 206 USPQ at 197.
 


Following the reasoning in
 *Chakrabarty,* the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences
 determined that animals are patentable subject matter under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 In *Ex parte Allen,* 2 USPQ2d 1425 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1987), the Board decided that a non-naturally occurring polyploid Pacific coast
 oyster could have been the proper subject of a patent under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 if all the criteria for patentability were satisfied. Shortly after the
 *Allen* decision, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks
 issued a notice (Animals - Patentability, 1077 O.G. 24, April 21, 1987) stating that
 the Patent and Trademark Office "now considers nonnaturally occurring, non-human
 multicellular living organisms, including animals, to be patentable subject matter
 within the scope of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 


With respect to plant subject matter, the Supreme
 Court held that patentable subject matter under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** includes newly
 developed plant breeds, even though plant protection is also available under the
 Plant Patent Act (**[35 U.S.C. 161](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304416)** - **[164](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304454)**) and the Plant Variety
 Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 *et. seq.*). *J.E.M. Ag
 Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’ l, Inc.,* 534 U.S. 124, 143-46, 60
 USPQ2d 1865, 1874 (2001) (The scope of coverage of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 is not limited by the Plant Patent Act or the Plant Variety Protection Act; each
 statute can be regarded as effective because of its different requirements and
 protections).
 


See **[MPEP §
 2106.03](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397)** for a discussion of the categories of statutory
 subject matter. 
 

***B.******Living Subject Matter May Be Eligible for Patent Protection***The Supreme Court in *Chakrabarty*
 held a claim to a genetically engineered bacterium eligible, because the claimed
 bacterium was not a "product of nature" exception. As the Court explained, the
 modified bacterium was patentable because the patent claim was not to a "hitherto
 unknown natural phenomenon," but instead had "markedly different characteristics from
 any found in nature," due to the additional plasmids and resultant capacity for
 degrading oil. 447 U.S. at 309-10, 206 USPQ at 197.
 


Subsequent judicial decisions have made clear that the Supreme
 Court’s decision in *Chakrabarty* is "central" to the eligibility
 inquiry with respect to nature-based products. See, *e.g., Association for
 Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,* 569 U.S. 576, 590, 106
 USPQ2d 1972, 1979 (2013). For example, the Federal Circuit has indicated that
 "discoveries that possess ‘markedly different characteristics from any found in
 nature,’ … are eligible for patent protection." *In re Roslin Institute
 (Edinburgh),* 750 F.3d 1333, 1336, 110 USPQ2d 1668, 1671 (Fed. Cir. 2014)
 (quoting *Chakrabarty,* 447 U.S. at 310, 206 USPQ2d at 197). In
 *Roslin,* the claimed invention was a live-born clone of a
 pre-existing, non-embryonic, donor mammal selected from cattle, sheep, pigs, and
 goats. An embodiment of the claimed invention was the famous Dolly the Sheep, which
 the court stated was "the first mammal ever cloned from an adult somatic cell."
 Despite acknowledging that the method used to create the claimed clones "constituted
 a breakthrough in scientific discovery", the court relied on
 *Chakrabarty* in holding the claims ineligible because "Dolly
 herself is an exact genetic replica of another sheep and does not possess ‘markedly
 different characteristics from any [farm animals] found in nature.’"
 *Roslin,* 750 F.3d at 1337, 110 USPQ2d at 1671.
 


See **[MPEP §
 2106.04](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0)** for a discussion of the judicial exceptions in
 general, **[MPEP § 2106.04(b)](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c)**, subsection II, for a discussion of
 products of nature, and **[MPEP § 2106.04(c)](s2106.html#ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1)** for a discussion
 of the markedly different characteristics analysis that examiners should use to
 determine whether a nature-based product such as living subject matter is eligible
 for patent protection. 
 

**III.** **HUMAN ORGANISMS ARE NONSTATUTORY SUBJECT MATTER**Congress has excluded claims directed to or encompassing
 a human organism from patentability. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), Public
 Law 112-29, **[sec. 33(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#aiasec33limitonissuance)**, 125 Stat. 284,
 states:
 



> 
>  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no patent
>  may issue on a claim directed to or encompassing a human organism.
>  
> 
> 
> 


The legislative history of the AIA includes the following
 statement, which sheds light on the meaning of this provision:
 



> 
> [T]he U.S. Patent Office has already issued patents on
>  genes, stems cells, animals with human genes, and a host of non-biologic products
>  used by humans, but it has not issued patents on claims directed to human organisms,
>  including human embryos and fetuses. My amendment would not affect the former, but
>  would simply affirm the latter.
>  
> 
> 
> 


157 Cong. Rec. E1177-04 (testimony of Representative Dave
 Weldon previously presented in connection with the Consolidated Appropriations Act,
 2004, Public Law 108-199, 634, 118 Stat. 3, 101, and later resubmitted with regard to
 the AIA; see 149 Cong. Rec. E2417-01). Thus, **[section 33(a) of the
 AIA](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#aiasec33limitonissuance)** codifies existing Office policy that human organisms are not
 patent-eligible subject matter. 
 


If the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claimed invention as a
 whole encompasses a human organism, then a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and
 **[AIA
 sec. 33(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#aiasec33limitonissuance)** must be made indicating that the claimed invention is
 directed to a human organism and is therefore nonstatutory subject matter. Furthermore,
 the claimed invention must be examined with regard to all issues pertinent to
 patentability, and any applicable rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, or
 **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** must also be made. 
 


Use form paragraph **[7.04.03](#fp7.04.03)** to reject a claim under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[AIA sec. 33(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#aiasec33limitonissuance)**.
 


# ¶ 7.04.03 Human Organism


Section 33(a) of the America Invents Act reads as
 follows
 


Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no patent may
 issue on a claim directed to or encompassing a human organism.
 


Claim **[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and
 section 33(a) of the America Invents Act as being directed to or encompassing a human
 organism. See also Animals - Patentability, 1077 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 24 (April 21, 1987)
 (indicating that human organisms are excluded from the scope of patentable subject matter
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**). **[2]**
