# 2182 Search and Identification of the Prior Art [R-08.2017]


The application of a prior art reference to a means- (or step-)
 plus-function limitation requires that the prior art element perform the identical function
 specified in the claim. However, if a prior art reference only teaches identity of function
 to that specified in a claim, then an examiner carries the initial
 burden of proof for showing that the prior art structure or step is the same as or
 equivalent to the structure, material, or acts described in the specification which has
 been identified as corresponding to the claimed means- (or step-) plus-function. Similarly,
 if the prior art reference teaches the identical structure or acts but is silent about
 performing the claimed function, a reasonable presumption is that the prior art structure
 inherently performs the same function. The examiner must provide a "sound basis for
 believing" that the prior art structure or acts would be capable of performing the claimed
 function. *In re Spada,* 911 F.2d 705, 708, 15 USPQ2d 1655, 1658 (Fed.
 Cir. 1990). See **[MPEP §
 2114](s2114.html#d0e201520)**, subsection I, for more information on establishing
 inherency for functional limitations. 
 


The means- (or step-) plus- function limitation should be interpreted in a
 manner consistent with the specification disclosure. The Federal Circuit explained the two
 step analysis involved in construing means- (or step-) plus- function limitations in
 *Golight Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,* 355 F.3d 1327, 1333-34, 69
 USPQ2d 1481, 1486 (Fed. Cir. 2004):

If the specification defines what is meant by the limitation for the
 purposes of the claimed invention, the examiner should interpret the limitation as having
 that meaning. If no definition is provided, some judgment must be exercised in determining
 the scope of the limitation. See, e.g., *B. Braun Medical, Inc. v. Abbott
 Labs.,* 124 F.3d 1419, 1424, 43 USPQ2d 1896, 1900 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("We hold
 that, pursuant to [**[35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, sixth paragraph], structure disclosed in the
 specification is ‘corresponding’ structure only if the specification or prosecution history
 clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim. This duty
 to link or associate structure to function is the *quid pro quo* for the
 convenience of employing **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, paragraph 6." The court refused to interpret a
 means-plus-function limitation as corresponding to a disclosed valve seat structure, as
 argued by patentee, since there was no indication in the specification or prosecution
 history that this structure corresponds to the recited function, and there was an
 explicitly clear association between that function and a traverse cross section bar
 structure disclosed in the specification.).
