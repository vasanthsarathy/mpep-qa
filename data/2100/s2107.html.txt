# 2107 Guidelines for Examination of Applications for Compliance with the
 Utility Requirement [R-11.2013]

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**The following Guidelines establish the policies and procedures to be
 followed by Office personnel in the evaluation of any patent application for compliance
 with the utility requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. These Guidelines have been promulgated to assist Office personnel in their
 review of applications for compliance with the utility requirement. The Guidelines do
 not alter the substantive requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, nor
 are they designed to obviate the examiner’s review of applications for compliance with
 all other statutory requirements for patentability. The Guidelines do not constitute
 substantive rulemaking and hence do not have the force and effect of law. Rejections
 will be based upon the substantive law, and it is these rejections which are appealable.
 Consequently, any perceived failure by Office personnel to follow these Guidelines is
 neither appealable nor petitionable.
 

**II.** **EXAMINATION GUIDELINES FOR THE UTILITY REQUIREMENT** Office personnel are to adhere to the following procedures when
 reviewing patent applications for compliance with the "useful invention" ("utility")
 requirement of **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. 
 


* (A) Read the claims and the supporting written description.
	+ (1) Determine what the applicant has claimed, noting any
	 specific embodiments of the invention.
	+ (2) Ensure that the claims define statutory subject matter
	 (i.e., a process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or
	 improvement thereof).
	+ (3) If at any time during the examination, it becomes readily
	 apparent that the claimed invention has a well-established utility, do not
	 impose a rejection based on lack of utility. An invention has a
	 well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary skill in the art would
	 immediately appreciate why the invention is useful based on the
	 characteristics of the invention (e.g., properties or applications of a
	 product or process), and (ii) the utility is specific, substantial, and
	 credible.
* (B) Review the claims and the supporting written description to
 determine if the applicant has asserted for the claimed invention any specific and
 substantial utility that is credible:
	+ (1) If the applicant has asserted that the claimed invention is
	 useful for any particular practical purpose (i.e., it has a "specific and
	 substantial utility") and the assertion would be considered credible by a
	 person of ordinary skill in the art, do not impose a rejection based on lack
	 of utility.
		- (i) A claimed invention must have a specific and
		 substantial utility. This requirement excludes "throw-away,"
		 "insubstantial," or "nonspecific" utilities, such as the use of a
		 complex invention as landfill, as a way of satisfying the utility
		 requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
		- (ii) Credibility is assessed from the perspective of one
		 of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure and any other
		 evidence of record (e.g., test data, affidavits or declarations from
		 experts in the art, patents or printed publications) that is probative
		 of the applicant’s assertions. An applicant need only provide one
		 credible assertion of specific and substantial utility for each
		 claimed invention to satisfy the utility requirement.
	+ (2) If no assertion of specific and substantial utility for the
	 claimed invention made by the applicant is credible, and the claimed
	 invention does not have a readily apparent well-established utility, reject
	 the claim(s) under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** on the
	 grounds that the invention as claimed lacks utility. Also reject the claims
	 under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
	 **[pre-AIA
	 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, on the basis that the
	 disclosure fails to teach how to use the invention as claimed. The
	 **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
	 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)**, first paragraph, rejection
	 imposed in conjunction with a **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** rejection
	 should incorporate by reference the grounds of the corresponding
	 **[35
	 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** rejection.
	+ (3) If the applicant has not asserted any specific and
	 substantial utility for the claimed invention and it does not have a readily
	 apparent well-established utility, impose a rejection under
	 **[35
	 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, emphasizing that the applicant has not
	 disclosed a specific and substantial utility for the invention. Also impose
	 a separate rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
	 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)**, first paragraph, on the basis
	 that the applicant has not disclosed how to use the invention due to the
	 lack of a specific and substantial utility. The **[35 U.S.C.
	 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** rejections
	 shift the burden of coming forward with evidence to the applicant to:
		- (i) Explicitly identify a specific and substantial
		 utility for the claimed invention; and
		- (ii) Provide evidence that one of ordinary skill in the
		 art would have recognized that the identified specific and substantial
		 utility was well-established at the time of filing. The examiner
		 should review any subsequently submitted evidence of utility using the
		 criteria outlined above. The examiner should also ensure that there is
		 an adequate nexus between the evidence and the properties of the now
		 claimed subject matter as disclosed in the application as filed. That
		 is, the applicant has the burden to establish a probative relation
		 between the submitted evidence and the originally disclosed properties
		 of the claimed invention.
	+ (C) Any rejection based on lack of utility should include a
	 detailed explanation why the claimed invention has no specific and
	 substantial credible utility. Whenever possible, the examiner should provide
	 documentary evidence regardless of publication date (e.g., scientific or
	 technical journals, excerpts from treatises or books, or U.S. or foreign
	 patents) to support the factual basis for the *prima facie*
	 showing of no specific and substantial credible utility. If documentary
	 evidence is not available, the examiner should specifically explain the
	 scientific basis for his or her factual conclusions.
		- (1) Where the asserted utility is not specific or
		 substantial, a *prima facie* showing must establish
		 that it is more likely than not that a person of ordinary skill in the
		 art would not consider that any utility asserted by the applicant
		 would be specific and substantial. The *prima facie*
		 showing must contain the following elements:
			* (i) An explanation that clearly sets forth the
			 reasoning used in concluding that the asserted utility for the
			 claimed invention is not both specific and substantial nor
			 well-established;
			* (ii) Support for factual findings relied upon in
			 reaching this conclusion; and
			* (iii) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of
			 record, including utilities taught in the closest prior art.
		- (2) Where the asserted specific and substantial utility
		 is not credible, a *prima facie* showing of no
		 specific and substantial credible utility must establish that it is
		 more likely than not that a person skilled in the art would not
		 consider credible any specific and substantial utility asserted by the
		 applicant for the claimed invention. The *prima
		 facie* showing must contain the following elements:
			* (i) An explanation that clearly sets forth the
			 reasoning used in concluding that the asserted specific and
			 substantial utility is not credible;
			* (ii) Support for factual findings relied upon in
			 reaching this conclusion; and
			* (iii) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of
			 record, including utilities taught in the closest prior art.
		- (3) Where no specific and substantial utility is
		 disclosed or is well-established, a *prima facie* showing of no specific and substantial utility need only
		 establish that applicant has not asserted a utility and that, on the
		 record before the examiner, there is no known well-established
		 utility.
	+ (D) A rejection based on lack of utility should not be
	 maintained if an asserted utility for the claimed invention would be
	 considered specific, substantial, and credible by a person of ordinary skill
	 in the art in view of all evidence of record.


Office personnel are reminded that they must treat as true a statement
 of fact made by an applicant in relation to an asserted utility, unless countervailing
 evidence can be provided that shows that one of ordinary skill in the art would have a
 legitimate basis to doubt the credibility of such a statement. Similarly, Office
 personnel must accept an opinion from a qualified expert that is based upon relevant
 facts whose accuracy is not being questioned; it is improper to disregard the opinion
 solely because of a disagreement over the significance or meaning of the facts
 offered.
 


Once a *prima facie* showing of no specific and
 substantial credible utility has been properly established, the applicant bears the
 burden of rebutting it. The applicant can do this by amending the claims, by providing
 reasoning or arguments, or by providing evidence in the form of a declaration under
 **[37 CFR
 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)** or a patent or a printed publication that rebuts the basis
 or logic of the *prima facie* showing. If the applicant responds to the
 *prima facie* rejection, the Office personnel should review the
 original disclosure, any evidence relied upon in establishing the *prima
 facie* showing, any claim amendments, and any new reasoning or evidence
 provided by the applicant in support of an asserted specific and substantial credible
 utility. It is essential for Office personnel to recognize, fully consider and respond
 to each substantive element of any response to a rejection based on lack of utility.
 Only where the totality of the record continues to show that the asserted utility is not
 specific, substantial, and credible should a rejection based on lack of utility be
 maintained.
 


If the applicant satisfactorily rebuts a *prima facie*
 rejection based on lack of utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, withdraw the
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** rejection and the corresponding rejection imposed under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)**, first
 paragraph.
 



# 2107.01 General Principles Governing Utility Rejections [R-10.2019]



#### *35 U.S.C. 101   
 Inventions patentable*


Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,
 manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may
 obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this
 title.
 



See **[MPEP
 § 2107](s2107.html#d0e198469)** for guidelines for the examination of applications for
 compliance with the utility requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 


The Office must examine each application to ensure compliance with the
 "useful invention" or utility requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. In discharging this
 obligation, however, Office personnel must keep in mind several general principles that
 control application of the utility requirement. **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** has been interpreted
 as imposing four purposes. First, **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** limits an inventor to
 ONE patent for a claimed invention. If more than one patent is sought, a patent
 applicant will receive a statutory double patenting rejection for claims included in
 more than one application that are directed to the same invention. See
  **[MPEP §
 804](s804.html#d0e98894)**. Second, the inventor(s) must be the applicant in an
 application filed before September 16, 2012, (except as otherwise provided in
 **[pre-AIA 37 CFR
 1.41(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317757)**) and the inventor or each joint inventor must be
 identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012. See
 **[MPEP §
 2109](s2109.html#ch2100_d2c183_22374_28b)** for a detailed discussion of inventorship,
 **[MPEP §
 602.01(c)](s602.html#d0e4830ss602)***et seq.* for details regarding correction of inventorship,
 **[MPEP §
 2157](s2157.html#ch2100_d20034_1bb92_e7)** for rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[115](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302875912)** for failure
 to set forth the correct inventorship, and **[MPEP § 2137](s2137.html#d0e206570)** for rejections under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** (for applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**) for failure to set forth the correct inventorship. Third,
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** defines which categories of inventions are eligible for patent
 protection. An invention that is not a machine, an article of manufacture, a composition
 or a process cannot be patented. See *Diamond**v.**Chakrabarty,* 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980);
 *Diamond**v.**Diehr,* 450 U.S. 175, 209 USPQ 1 (1981); *In re
 Nuijten,* 500 F.3d 1346, 1354, 84 USPQ2d 1495, 1500 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
 Fourth, **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** serves to ensure that patents are granted on only those
 inventions that are "useful." This second purpose has a Constitutional footing — Article
 I, Section 8 of the Constitution authorizes Congress to provide exclusive rights to
 inventors to promote the "useful arts." See *Carl Zeiss Stiftung**v.**Renishaw PLC,* 945 F.2d 1173, 20 USPQ2d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Thus,
 to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, an applicant must
 claim an invention that is statutory subject matter and must show that the claimed
 invention is "useful" for some purpose either explicitly or implicitly. Application of
 this latter element of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** is the focus of these guidelines.
 


Deficiencies under the "useful invention" requirement of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** will arise in one of two forms. The first is where it is not
 apparent why the invention is "useful." This can occur when an applicant fails to
 identify any specific and substantial utility for the invention or fails to disclose
 enough information about the invention to make its usefulness immediately apparent to
 those familiar with the technological field of the invention. *Brenner**v.**Manson,* 383 U.S. 519, 148 USPQ 689 (1966); *In re
 Fisher,* 421 F.3d 1365, 76 USPQ2d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2005); *In re
 Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 26 USPQ2d 1600 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The second type of
 deficiency arises in the rare instance where an assertion of specific and substantial
 utility for the invention made by an applicant is not credible.
 

**I.** **SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIAL REQUIREMENTS**To satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, an invention must
 be "useful." Courts have recognized that the term "useful" used with reference to the
 utility requirement can be a difficult term to define. *Brenner**v.**Manson,* 383 U.S. 519, 529, 148 USPQ 689, 693 (1966) (simple
 everyday word like "useful" can be "pregnant with ambiguity when applied to the facts
 of life."). Where an applicant has set forth a specific and substantial utility,
 courts have been reluctant to uphold a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 solely on the basis that the applicant’s opinion as to the nature of the specific and
 substantial utility was inaccurate. For example, in *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 206 USPQ 881 (CCPA 1980), the court reversed
 a finding by the Office that the applicant had not set forth a "practical" utility
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. In this case the applicant asserted that the composition
 was "useful" in a particular pharmaceutical application and provided evidence to
 support that assertion. Courts have used the labels "practical utility," "substantial
 utility," or "specific utility" to refer to this aspect of the "useful invention"
 requirement of **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has
 stated:
 



> 
> Practical utility is a shorthand way of attributing "real-world"
>  value to claimed subject matter. In other words, one skilled in the art can use a
>  claimed discovery in a manner which provides some immediate benefit to the
>  public.
>  
> 
> 
> 


*Nelson v. Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA
 1980).
 


Practical considerations require the Office to rely on the
 inventor’s understanding of the invention in determining whether and in what regard
 an invention is believed to be "useful." Because of this, Office personnel should
 focus on and be receptive to assertions made by the applicant that an invention is
 "useful" for a particular reason. 
 

***A.******Specific Utility***A "specific utility" is *specific* to the
 subject matter claimed and can "provide a well-defined and particular benefit to
 the public." *In re Fisher,* 421 F.3d 1365, 1371, 76 USPQ2d 1225,
 1230 (Fed. Cir. 2005). This contrasts with a *general* utility
 that would be applicable to the broad class of the invention. Office personnel
 should distinguish between situations where an applicant has disclosed a specific
 use for or application of the invention and situations where the applicant merely
 indicates that the invention may prove useful without identifying with specificity
 why it is considered useful. For example, indicating that a
 compound may be useful in treating unspecified disorders, or that the compound has
 "useful biological" properties, would not be sufficient to define a specific
 utility for the compound. See, e.g., *In re Kirk,* 376 F.2d 936,
 153 USPQ 48 (CCPA 1967); *In re Joly,* 376 F.2d 906, 153 USPQ 45
 (CCPA 1967). Similarly, a claim to a polynucleotide whose use is disclosed simply
 as a "gene probe" or "chromosome marker" would not be considered to be
 *specific* in the absence of a disclosure of a specific DNA
 target. See *In re Fisher,* 421 F.3d at 1374, 76 USPQ2d at 1232
 ("Any EST [expressed sequence tag] transcribed from any gene in the maize genome
 has the potential to perform any one of the alleged uses…. Nothing about
 [applicant’s] seven alleged uses set the five claimed ESTs apart from the more
 than 32,000 ESTs disclosed in the [ ] application or indeed from any EST derived
 from any organism. Accordingly, we conclude that [applicant] has only disclosed
 general uses for its claimed ESTs, not specific ones that satisfy
 **[§
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**."). A general statement of diagnostic utility, such as
 diagnosing an unspecified disease, would ordinarily be insufficient absent a
 disclosure of what condition can be diagnosed. Contrast the situation where an
 applicant discloses a specific biological activity and reasonably correlates that
 activity to a disease condition. Assertions falling within the latter category are
 sufficient to identify a specific utility for the invention. Assertions that fall
 in the former category are insufficient to define a specific utility for the
 invention, especially if the assertion takes the form of a general statement that
 makes it clear that a "useful" invention may arise from
 what has been disclosed by the applicant. *Knapp v.**Anderson,* 477 F.2d 588, 177 USPQ 688 (CCPA 1973).
 

***B.******Substantial Utility*** "[A]n application must show that an invention is useful to the
 public as disclosed in its current form, not that it may prove useful at some
 future date after further research. Simply put, to satisfy the ‘substantial’
 utility requirement, an asserted use must show that the claimed invention has a
 significant and presently available benefit to the public."
 *Fisher,* 421 F.3d at 1371, 76 USPQ2d at 1230. The claims at
 issue in *Fisher* were directed to expressed sequence tags
 (ESTs), which are short nucleotide sequences that can be used to discover what
 genes and downstream proteins are expressed in a cell. The court held that "the
 claimed ESTs can be used only to gain further information about the underlying
 genes and the proteins encoded for by those genes. The claimed ESTs themselves are
 not an end of [applicant’s] research effort, but only tools to be used along the
 way in the search for a practical utility…. [Applicant] does not identify the
 function for the underlying protein-encoding genes. Absent such identification, we
 hold that the claimed ESTs have not been researched and understood to the point of
 providing an immediate, well-defined, real world benefit to the public meriting
 the grant of a patent." *Id.* at 1376, 76 USPQ2d at 1233-34).
 Thus a "substantial utility" defines a "real world" use. Utilities that require or
 constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a "real
 world" context of use are not substantial utilities. For example, both a
 therapeutic method of treating a known or newly discovered disease and an assay
 method for identifying compounds that themselves have a "substantial utility"
 define a "real world" context of use. An assay that measures the presence of a
 material which has a stated correlation to a predisposition to the onset of a
 particular disease condition would also define a "real world" context of use in
 identifying potential candidates for preventive measures or further monitoring. On
 the other hand, the following are examples of situations that require or
 constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a "real
 world" context of use and, therefore, do not define "substantial utilities":
 


* (A) Basic research such as studying the properties of the
 claimed product itself or the mechanisms in which the material is
 involved;
* (B) A method of treating an *unspecified*
 disease or condition;
* (C) A method of assaying for or identifying a material that
 itself has no specific and/or substantial utility;
* (D) A method of making a material that itself has no specific,
 substantial, and credible utility; and
* (E) A claim to an intermediate product for use in making a
 final product that has no specific, substantial and credible utility.


Office personnel must be careful not to interpret the phrase
 "immediate benefit to the public" or similar formulations in other cases to mean
 that products or services based on the claimed invention must be "currently
 available" to the public in order to satisfy the utility requirement. See, e.g.,
 *Brenner v. Manson,* 383 U.S. 519, 534-35, 148 USPQ 689, 695
 (1966). Rather, any reasonable use that an applicant has identified for the
 invention that can be viewed as providing a public benefit should be accepted as
 sufficient, at least with regard to defining a "substantial" utility.
 

***C.******Research Tools***Some confusion can result when one attempts to label certain
 types of inventions as not being capable of having a specific and substantial
 utility based on the setting in which the invention is to be used. One example is
 inventions to be used in a research or laboratory setting. Many research tools
 such as gas chromatographs, screening assays, and nucleotide sequencing techniques
 have a clear, specific and unquestionable utility (e.g., they are useful in
 analyzing compounds). An assessment that focuses on whether an invention is useful
 only in a research setting thus does not address whether the invention is in fact
 "useful" in a patent sense. Instead, Office personnel must distinguish between
 inventions that have a specifically identified substantial utility and inventions
 whose asserted utility requires further research to identify or reasonably
 confirm. Labels such as "research tool," "intermediate" or "for research purposes"
 are not helpful in determining if an applicant has identified a specific and
 substantial utility for the invention. 
 

**II.** **WHOLLY INOPERATIVE INVENTIONS; "INCREDIBLE" UTILITY**An invention that is "inoperative" (i.e., it does not operate to
 produce the results claimed by the patent applicant) is not a "useful" invention in
 the meaning of the patent law. See, e.g., *Newman**v.**Quigg,* 877 F.2d 1575, 1581, 11 USPQ2d 1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 1989);
 *In re Harwood,* 390 F.2d 985, 989, 156 USPQ 673, 676 (CCPA 1968)
 ("An inoperative invention, of course, does not satisfy the requirement of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** that an invention be useful."). However, as the Federal
 Circuit has stated, "[t]o violate **[[35 U.S.C.] 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** the claimed
 device must be totally incapable of achieving a useful
 result." *Brooktree Corp.**v.**Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.,* 977 F.2d 1555, 1571, 24 USPQ2d 1401,
 1412 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (emphasis added). See also *E.I. du Pont De Nemours and
 Co.**v.**Berkley and Co.,* 620 F.2d 1247, 1260 n.17, 205 USPQ 1, 10 n.17
 (8th Cir. 1980) ("A small degree of utility is sufficient . . . The claimed invention
 must only be capable of performing some beneficial function . . . An invention does
 not lack utility merely because the particular embodiment disclosed in the patent
 lacks perfection or performs crudely . . . A commercially successful product is not
 required . . . Nor is it essential that the invention accomplish all its intended
 functions . . . or operate under all conditions . . . partial success being
 sufficient to demonstrate patentable utility . . . In short, the defense of
 non-utility cannot be sustained without proof of total incapacity." If an invention
 is only partially successful in achieving a useful result, a
 rejection of the claimed invention as a whole based on a lack of utility is not
 appropriate. See *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed.
 Cir. 1995); *In re Gardner,* 475 F.2d 1389, 177 USPQ 396 (CCPA),
 *reh’g denied,* 480 F.2d 879 (CCPA 1973); *In re
 Marzocchi,* 439 F.2d 220, 169 USPQ 367 (CCPA 1971).
 


Situations where an invention is found to be "inoperative" and
 therefore lacking in utility are rare, and rejections maintained solely on this
 ground by a federal court even rarer. In many of these cases, the utility asserted by
 the applicant was thought to be "incredible in the light of the knowledge of the art,
 or factually misleading" when initially considered by the Office. *In re
 Citron,* 325 F.2d 248, 253, 139 USPQ 516, 520 (CCPA 1963). Other cases
 suggest that on initial evaluation, the Office considered the asserted utility to be
 inconsistent with known scientific principles or "speculative at best" as to whether
 attributes of the invention necessary to impart the asserted utility were actually
 present in the invention. *In re Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ
 209 (CCPA 1977). However cast, the underlying finding by the court in these cases was
 that, based on the factual record of the case, it was clear
 that the invention could not and did not work as the inventor claimed it did. Indeed,
 the use of many labels to describe a single problem (e.g., a false assertion
 regarding utility) has led to some of the confusion that exists today with regard to
 a rejection based on the "utility" requirement. Examples of such cases include: an
 invention asserted to change the taste of food using a magnetic field
 *(Fregeau**v.**Mossinghoff,* 776 F.2d 1034, 227 USPQ 848 (Fed. Cir. 1985)), a
 perpetual motion machine *(Newman**v.**Quigg,* 877 F.2d 1575, 11 USPQ2d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 1989)), a flying
 machine operating on "flapping or flutter function" *(In re
 Houghton,* 433 F.2d 820, 167 USPQ 687 (CCPA 1970)), a "cold fusion"
 process for producing energy *(In re Swartz,* 232 F.3d 862, 56
 USPQ2d 1703 (Fed. Cir. 2000)), a method for increasing the energy output of fossil
 fuels upon combustion through exposure to a magnetic field *(In re
 Ruskin,* 354 F.2d 395, 148 USPQ 221 (CCPA 1966)), uncharacterized
 compositions for curing a wide array of cancers *(In re Citron,* 325
 F.2d 248, 139 USPQ 516 (CCPA 1963)), and a method of controlling the aging process
 *(In re Eltgroth,* 419 F.2d 918, 164 USPQ 221 (CCPA 1970)). These
 examples are fact specific and should not be applied as a
 *per se* rule. Thus, in view of the rare nature of such cases,
 Office personnel should not label an asserted utility "incredible," "speculative" or
 otherwise unless it is clear that a rejection based on "lack of utility" is
 proper.
 

**III.** **THERAPEUTIC OR PHARMACOLOGICAL UTILITY**Inventions asserted to have utility in the treatment of human or
 animal disorders are subject to the same legal requirements for utility as inventions
 in any other field of technology. *In re Chilowsky,* 229 F.2d 457,
 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956) ("There appears to be no basis in the statutes
 or decisions for requiring any more conclusive evidence of operativeness in one type
 of case than another. The character and amount of evidence needed may vary, depending
 on whether the alleged operation described in the application appears to accord with
 or to contravene established scientific principles or to depend upon principles
 alleged but not generally recognized, but the degree of certainty as to the ultimate
 fact of operativeness or inoperativeness should be the same in all cases");
 *In re Gazave,* 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967)
 ("Thus, in the usual case where the mode of operation alleged can be readily
 understood and conforms to the known laws of physics and chemistry, operativeness is
 not questioned, and no further evidence is required."). As such, pharmacological or
 therapeutic inventions that provide any "immediate benefit to
 the public" satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. The utility being asserted in
 *Nelson* related to a compound with pharmacological utility.
 *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980). Office
 personnel should rely on *Nelson* and other cases as providing
 general guidance when evaluating the utility of an invention that is based on any
 therapeutic, prophylactic, or pharmacological activities of that invention. 
 


Courts have repeatedly found that the mere
 identification of a pharmacological activity of a compound
 that is relevant to an asserted pharmacological use provides an "immediate benefit to
 the public" and thus satisfies the utility requirement. As the Court of Customs and
 Patent Appeals held in *Nelson**v.**Bowler*:
 



> 
> Knowledge of the pharmacological activity of any compound is
>  obviously beneficial to the public. It is inherently faster and easier to combat
>  illnesses and alleviate symptoms when the medical profession is armed with an
>  arsenal of chemicals having known pharmacological activities. Since it is crucial
>  to provide researchers with an incentive to disclose pharmacological activities in
>  as many compounds as possible, we conclude that adequate proof of any such
>  activity constitutes a showing of practical utility.
>  
> 
> 
> 


*Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980).
 


In *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* the court addressed the practical utility requirement in
 the context of an interference proceeding. Bowler challenged the patentability of the
 invention claimed by Nelson on the basis that Nelson had failed to sufficiently and
 persuasively disclose in his application a practical utility for the invention.
 Nelson had developed and claimed a class of synthetic prostaglandins modeled on
 naturally occurring prostaglandins. Naturally occurring prostaglandins are bioactive
 compounds that, at the time of Nelson’s application, had a recognized value in
 pharmacology (e.g., the stimulation of uterine smooth muscle which resulted in labor
 induction or abortion, the ability to raise or lower blood pressure, etc.). To
 support the utility he identified in his disclosure, Nelson included in his
 application the results of tests demonstrating the bioactivity of his new substituted
 prostaglandins relative to the bioactivity of naturally occurring prostaglandins. The
 court concluded that Nelson had satisfied the practical utility requirement in
 identifying the synthetic prostaglandins as pharmacologically active compounds. In
 reaching this conclusion, the court considered and rejected arguments advanced by
 Bowler that attacked the evidentiary basis for Nelson’s assertions that the compounds
 were pharmacologically active.
 


In *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885
 (CCPA 1980), an inventor claimed protection for pharmaceutical compositions for
 treating leukemia. The active ingredient in the compositions was a structural analog
 to a known anticancer agent. The applicant provided evidence showing that the claimed
 analogs had the same general pharmaceutical activity as the known anticancer agents.
 The court reversed the Board’s finding that the asserted pharmaceutical utility was
 "incredible," pointing to the evidence that showed the relevant pharmacological
 activity.
 


In *Cross**v.**Iizuka,* 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Federal
 Circuit affirmed a finding by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences that a
 pharmacological utility had been disclosed in the application of one party to an
 interference proceeding. The invention that was the subject of the interference count
 was a chemical compound used for treating blood disorders. Cross had challenged the
 evidence in Iizuka’s specification that supported the claimed utility. However, the
 Federal Circuit relied extensively on *Nelson**v.**Bowler* in finding that Iizuka’s application had sufficiently
 disclosed a pharmacological utility for the compounds. It distinguished the case from
 cases where only a generalized "nebulous" expression, such as "biological
 properties," had been disclosed in a specification. Such statements, the court held,
 "convey little explicit indication regarding the utility of a compound."
 *Cross,* 753 F.2d at 1048, 224 USPQ at 745 (citing *In re
 Kirk,* 376 F.2d 936, 941, 153 USPQ 48, 52 (CCPA 1967)).
 


Similarly, courts have found utility for therapeutic inventions
 despite the fact that an applicant is at a very early stage in the development of a
 pharmaceutical product or therapeutic regimen based on a claimed pharmacological or
 bioactive compound or composition. The Federal Circuit, in *Cross**v.**Iizuka,* 753 F.2d 1040, 1051, 224 USPQ 739, 747-48 (Fed. Cir.
 1985), commented on the significance of data from *in vitro* testing
 that showed pharmacological activity:
 



> 
> We perceive no insurmountable difficulty, under appropriate
>  circumstances, in finding that the first link in the screening chain, *in
>  vitro* testing, may establish a practical utility for the compound in
>  question. Successful *in vitro* testing will marshal resources
>  and direct the expenditure of effort to further *in vivo* testing
>  of the most potent compounds, thereby providing an immediate benefit to the
>  public, analogous to the benefit provided by the showing of an *in
>  vivo* utility.
>  
> 
> 
> 


The Federal Circuit has reiterated that therapeutic utility
 sufficient under the patent laws is not to be confused with the requirements of the
 FDA with regard to safety and efficacy of drugs to marketed in the United States.
 



> 
> FDA approval, however, is not a prerequisite for finding a
>  compound useful within the meaning of the patent laws. *Scott v.**Finney,* 34 F.3d 1058, 1063, 32 USPQ2d 1115, 1120 [(Fed.Cir.
>  1994)]. Usefulness in patent law, and in particular in the context of
>  pharmaceutical inventions, necessarily includes the expectation of further
>  research and development. The stage at which an invention in this field becomes
>  useful is well before it is ready to be administered to humans. Were we to require
>  Phase II testing in order to prove utility, the associated costs would prevent
>  many companies from obtaining patent protection on promising new inventions,
>  thereby eliminating an incentive to pursue, through research and development,
>  potential cures in many crucial areas such as the treatment of cancer.
>  
> 
> 
> 


*In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995).
 Accordingly, Office personnel should not construe **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, under the logic of
 "practical" utility or otherwise, to require that an applicant demonstrate that a
 therapeutic agent based on a claimed invention is a safe or fully effective drug for
 humans. See, e.g., *In re Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209
 (CCPA 1977); *In re Hartop,* 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962);
 *In re Anthony,* 414 F.2d 1383, 162 USPQ 594 (CCPA 1969);
 *In re Watson,* 517 F.2d 465, 186 USPQ 11 (CCPA 1975).
 


These general principles are equally applicable to situations where
 an applicant has claimed a process for treating a human or animal disorder. In such
 cases, the asserted utility is usually clear — the invention is asserted to be useful
 in treating the particular disorder. If the asserted utility is
 credible, there is no basis to challenge such a claim on
 the basis that it lacks utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 


 See **[MPEP § 2107.03](s2107.html#d0e200058)** for special considerations for asserted
 therapeutic or pharmacological utilities.
 

**IV.** **RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, FIRST
 PARAGRAPH, AND 35 U.S.C. 101** A deficiency under the utility prong of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 also creates a deficiency under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. See *In re
 Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995); *In re
 Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 1326 n.10, 206 USPQ 885, 889 n.11 (CCPA 1980);
 *In re Fouche,* 439 F.2d 1237, 1243, 169 USPQ 429, 434 (CCPA
 1971) ("If such compositions are in fact useless, appellant’s specification cannot
 have taught how to use them."). Courts have also cast the **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**/**[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** relationship such
 that **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** presupposes compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 See *In re Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 1200-1201, 26 USPQ2d 1600, 1603
 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("The how to use prong of **[section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** incorporates as a
 matter of law the requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** that the
 specification disclose as a matter of fact a practical utility for the invention. ...
 If the application fails as a matter of fact to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. §
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, then the application also fails as a matter of law to enable
 one of ordinary skill in the art to use the invention under **[35 U.S.C. §
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**."); *In re Kirk,* 376 F.2d 936, 942, 153 USPQ
 48, 53 (CCPA 1967) ("Necessarily, compliance with **[§ 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** requires a description of
 how to use presently useful inventions, otherwise an applicant would anomalously be
 required to teach how to use a useless invention."). For example, the Federal Circuit
 noted, "[o]bviously, if a claimed invention does not have utility, the specification
 cannot enable one to use it." *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d
 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). As such, a rejection properly imposed under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 for lack of utility should be accompanied with a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. It is equally clear that a rejection based on "lack of utility," whether
 grounded upon **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** or **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)**, first paragraph, rests on the same basis (i.e., the
 asserted utility is not credible). To avoid confusion, any lack of utility rejection
 that is imposed on the basis of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** should be
 accompanied by a rejection based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35

 paragraph, rejection should be set out as a separate rejection that incorporates by
 reference the factual basis and conclusions set forth in the **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 rejection. The **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, rejection should indicate that
 because the invention as claimed does not have utility, a person skilled in the art
 would not be able to use the invention as claimed, and as such, the claim is
 defective under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35

 paragraph, rejection based on lack of utility should not be imposed or maintained
 unless an appropriate basis exists for imposing a utility rejection under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. In other words, Office personnel should not impose a
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, rejection grounded on a "lack of utility" basis unless a **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 rejection is proper. In particular, the factual showing needed to impose a rejection
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** must be provided if a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, is to be imposed on "lack of utility" grounds.
 


It is important to recognize that **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, addresses matters other than those related to the question of whether or
 not an invention lacks utility. These matters include whether the claims are fully
 supported by the disclosure *(In re Vaeck,* 947 F.2d 488, 495, 20
 USPQ2d 1438, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1991)), whether the applicant has provided an enabling
 disclosure of the claimed subject matter *(In re Wright,* 999 F.2d
 1557, 1561-1562, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1513 (Fed. Cir. 1993)), whether the applicant has
 provided an adequate written description of the invention and whether the applicant
 has disclosed the best mode of practicing the claimed invention *(Chemcast
 Corp.**v.**Arco Indus. Corp.,* 913 F.2d 923, 927-928, 16 USPQ2d 1033,
 1036-1037 (Fed. Cir. 1990)). See also *Transco Products Inc.**v. Performance Contracting Inc.,* 38 F.3d 551, 32 USPQ2d 1077 (Fed.
 Cir. 1994); *Glaxo Inc.**v.**Novopharm Ltd.,* 52 F.3d 1043, 34 USPQ2d 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The
 fact that an applicant has disclosed a specific utility for an invention and provided
 a credible basis supporting that specific utility does not provide a basis for
 concluding that the claims comply with all the requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. For example, if an applicant has claimed a process of treating a certain
 disease condition with a certain compound and provided a credible basis for asserting
 that the compound is useful in that regard, but to actually practice the invention as
 claimed a person skilled in the relevant art would have to engage in an undue amount
 of experimentation, the claim may be defective under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 but not **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. To avoid confusion during examination, any rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, based on grounds other than "lack of utility" should be imposed separately
 from any rejection imposed due to "lack of utility" under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 and **[35

 paragraph.
 




# 2107.02 Procedural Considerations Related to Rejections for Lack of
 Utility [R-10.2019]

**I.** **THE CLAIMED INVENTION IS THE FOCUS OF THE UTILITY REQUIREMENT**The claimed invention is the focus of the assessment of whether an
 applicant has satisfied the utility requirement. Each claim (i.e., each "invention"),
 therefore, must be evaluated on its own merits for compliance with all statutory
 requirements. Generally speaking, however, a dependent claim will define an invention
 that has utility if the independent claim from which the dependent claim depends is
 drawn to the same statutory class of invention as the dependent claim and the
 independent claim defines an invention having utility. An exception to this general
 rule is where the utility specified for the invention defined in a dependent claim
 differs from that indicated for the invention defined in the independent claim from
 which the dependent claim depends. Where an applicant has established utility for a
 species that falls within an identified genus of compounds, and presents a generic
 claim covering the genus, as a general matter, that claim should be treated as being
 sufficient under **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. Only where it can be established that other species
 clearly encompassed by the claim do not have utility should a rejection be imposed on
 the generic claim. In such cases, the applicant should be encouraged to amend the
 generic claim so as to exclude the species that lack utility. 
 


It is common and sensible for an applicant to identify several
 specific utilities for an invention, particularly where the invention is a product
 (e.g., a machine, an article of manufacture or a composition of matter). However,
 regardless of the category of invention that is claimed (e.g., product or process),
 an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific utility for the
 claimed invention to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**; additional statements of utility, even if not "credible,"
 do not render the claimed invention lacking in utility. See, e.g.,
 *Raytheon**v.**Roper,* 724 F.2d 951, 958, 220 USPQ 592, 598 (Fed. Cir. 1983),
 *cert. denied,* 469 U.S. 835 (1984) ("When a properly claimed
 invention meets at least one stated objective, utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 is clearly shown."); *In re Gottlieb,* 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ
 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) ("Having found that the antibiotic is useful for some purpose,
 it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other purposes
 ‘indicated’ in the specification as possibly useful."); *In re
 Malachowski,* 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1976);
 *Hoffman**v.**Klaus,* 9 USPQ2d 1657 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1988). Thus, if
 applicant makes one credible assertion of utility, utility for the claimed invention
 as a whole is established.
 


Statements made by the applicant in the specification or incident to
 prosecution of the application before the Office cannot, standing alone, be the basis
 for a lack of utility rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** or
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**. *Tol-O-Matic, Inc.**v.**Proma Produkt-Und Mktg. Gesellschaft m.b.h.,* 945 F.2d 1546, 1553,
 20 USPQ2d 1332, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (It is not required that a particular
 characteristic set forth in the prosecution history be achieved in order to satisfy
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.). An applicant may include statements in the specification
 whose technical accuracy cannot be easily confirmed if those statements are not
 necessary to support the patentability of an invention with regard to any statutory
 basis. Thus, the Office should not require an applicant to strike nonessential
 statements relating to utility from a patent disclosure, regardless of the technical
 accuracy of the statement or assertion it presents. Office personnel should also be
 especially careful not to read into a claim unclaimed results, limitations or
 embodiments of an invention. See *Carl Zeiss Stiftung**v.**Renishaw PLC,* 945 F.2d 1173, 20 USPQ2d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 1991);
 *In re Krimmel,* 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961). Doing so
 can inappropriately change the relationship of an asserted utility to the claimed
 invention and raise issues not relevant to examination of that claim.
 

**II.** **IS THERE AN ASSERTED OR WELL-ESTABLISHED UTILITY FOR THE CLAIMED
 INVENTION?**Upon initial examination, the examiner should review the
 specification to determine if there are any statements asserting that the claimed
 invention is useful for any particular purpose. A complete disclosure should include
 a statement which identifies a specific and substantial utility for the invention. 
 

***A.******An Asserted Utility Must Be Specific and Substantial***A statement of specific and substantial utility should fully and
 clearly explain why the applicant believes the invention is useful. Such
 statements will usually explain the purpose of or how the invention may be used
 (e.g., a compound is believed to be useful in the treatment of a particular
 disorder). Regardless of the form of statement of utility, it must enable one
 ordinarily skilled in the art to understand why the applicant believes the claimed
 invention is useful. 
 


Except where an invention has a well-established utility, the
 failure of an applicant to specifically identify why an invention is believed to
 be useful renders the claimed invention deficient under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. In such cases, the applicant
 has failed to identify a "specific and substantial utility" for the claimed
 invention. For example, a statement that a composition has an unspecified
 "biological activity" or that does not explain why a composition with that
 activity is believed to be useful fails to set forth a "specific and substantial
 utility." *Brenner**v.**Manson,* 383 US 519, 148 USPQ 689 (1966) (general assertion of
 similarities to known compounds known to be useful without sufficient
 corresponding explanation why claimed compounds are believed to be similarly
 useful insufficient under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**); *In re
 Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 1201, 26 USPQ2d 1600, 1604 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 (disclosure that composition is "plastic-like" and can form "films" not sufficient
 to identify specific and substantial utility for invention); *In re
 Kirk,* 376 F.2d 936, 153 USPQ 48 (CCPA 1967) (indication that compound
 is "biologically active" or has "biological properties" insufficient standing
 alone). See also *In re Joly,* 376 F.2d 906, 153 USPQ 45 (CCPA
 1967); *Kawai**v.**Metlesics,* 480 F.2d 880, 890, 178 USPQ 158, 165 (CCPA 1973)
 (contrasting description of invention as sedative which did suggest specific
 utility to general suggestion of "pharmacological effects on the central nervous
 system" which did not). In contrast, a disclosure that identifies a particular
 biological activity of a compound and explains how that activity can be utilized
 in a particular therapeutic application of the compound does contain an assertion
 of specific and substantial utility for the invention.
 


Situations where an applicant either fails to indicate why an
 invention is considered useful, or where the applicant inaccurately describes the
 utility should rarely arise. One reason for this is that applicants are required
 to disclose the best mode known to them of practicing the invention at the time
 they file their application. An applicant who omits a description of the specific
 and substantial utility of the invention, or who incompletely describes that
 utility, may encounter problems with respect to the best mode requirement of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph.
 

***B.******No Statement of Utility for the Claimed Invention in the Specification
 Does Not Per Se Negate Utility***Occasionally, an applicant will not explicitly state in the
 specification or otherwise assert a specific and substantial utility for the
 claimed invention. If no statements can be found asserting a specific and
 substantial utility for the claimed invention in the specification, Office
 personnel should determine if the claimed invention has a well-established
 utility. An invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary
 skill in the art would immediately appreciate why the invention is useful based on
 the characteristics of the invention (e.g., properties or applications of a
 product or process), and (ii) the utility is specific, substantial, and credible.
 If an invention has a well- established utility, rejections under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, based on lack of utility should
 not be imposed. *In re Folkers,* 344 F.2d 970, 145 USPQ 390 (CCPA
 1965). For example, if an application teaches the cloning and characterization of
 the nucleotide sequence of a well-known protein such as insulin, and those skilled
 in the art at the time of filing knew that insulin had a well-established use, it
 would be improper to reject the claimed invention as lacking utility solely
 because of the omitted statement of specific and substantial utility.
 


If a person of ordinary skill would not immediately recognize a
 specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention (i.e., why it would be
 useful) based on the characteristics of the invention or statements made by the
 applicant, the examiner should reject the application under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, as failing to identify a
 specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention. The rejection should
 clearly indicate that the basis of the rejection is that the application fails to
 identify a specific and substantial utility for the invention. The rejection
 should also specify that the applicant must reply by indicating why the invention
 is believed useful and where support for any subsequently asserted utility can be
 found in the specification as filed. See **[MPEP § 2701](s2701.html#d0e271945)**.
 


If the applicant subsequently indicates why the invention is
 useful, Office personnel should review that assertion according to the standards
 articulated below for review of the credibility of an asserted utility.
 

**III.** **EVALUATING THE CREDIBILITY OF AN ASSERTED UTILITY*** 

***A.******An Asserted Utility Creates a Presumption of Utility***In most cases, an applicant’s assertion of utility creates a
 presumption of utility that will be sufficient to satisfy the utility requirement
 of **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. See, e.g., *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d
 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); *In re Irons,* 340 F.2d 974, 144
 USPQ 351 (CCPA 1965); *In re Langer,* 503 F.2d 1380, 183 USPQ 288
 (CCPA 1974); *In re Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154, 1159, 196 USPQ 209,
 212-13 (CCPA 1977). As the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals stated in
 *In re Langer*:
 



> 
> As a matter of Patent Office practice, a specification which
>  contains a disclosure of utility which corresponds in scope to the subject
>  matter sought to be patented must be taken as sufficient
>  to satisfy the utility requirement of **[§ 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** for the entire
>  claimed subject matter unless there is a reason for one
>  skilled in the art to question the objective truth of the statement of utility
>  or its scope.
>  
> 
> 
> 


*In re Langer,* 503 F.2d at 1391, 183 USPQ at 297 (emphasis in
 original). The "Langer" test for utility has been used by both the Federal Circuit
 and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in evaluation of rejections under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, where the rejection is based on a deficiency under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. In *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34
 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the Federal Circuit explicitly adopted the Court of
 Customs and Patent Appeals formulation of the "Langer" standard for
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph rejections, as it was expressed in a slightly reworded format in
 *In re Marzocchi,* 439 F.2d 220, 223, 169 USPQ 367, 369 (CCPA
 1971), namely:
 



> 
> [A] specification disclosure which contains a teaching of the
>  manner and process of making and using the invention in terms which correspond
>  in scope to those used in describing and defining the subject matter sought to
>  be patented must be taken as in compliance with the
>  enabling requirement of the first paragraph of **[§ 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**
>  unless there is reason to doubt the objective truth of the statements contained
>  therein which must be relied on for enabling support. (emphasis added).
>  
> 
> 
> 


Thus, *Langer* and subsequent cases direct the
 Office to presume that a statement of utility made by an applicant is true. See
 *In re Langer,* 503 F.2d at 1391, 183 USPQ at 297; *In
 re Malachowski,* 530 F.2d 1402, 1404, 189 USPQ 432, 435 (CCPA 1976);
 *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995).
 For obvious reasons of efficiency and in deference to an applicant’s understanding
 of the invention, when a statement of utility is evaluated, Office personnel
 should not begin by questioning the truth of the statement of utility. Instead,
 any inquiry must start by asking if there is any reason to question the truth of
 the statement of utility. This can be done by simply evaluating the logic of the
 statements made, taking into consideration any evidence cited by the applicant. If
 the asserted utility is credible (i.e., believable based on the record or the
 nature of the invention), a rejection based on "lack of utility" is not
 appropriate. Clearly, Office personnel should not begin an evaluation of utility
 by assuming that an asserted utility is likely to be false, based on the technical
 field of the invention or for other general reasons.
 


Compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** is a question of
 fact. *Raytheon**v.**Roper,* 724 F.2d 951, 956, 220 USPQ 592, 596 (Fed. Cir. 1983)
 *cert. denied,* 469 U.S. 835 (1984). Thus, to overcome the
 presumption of truth that an assertion of utility by the applicant enjoys, Office
 personnel must establish that it is more likely than not that one of ordinary
 skill in the art would doubt (i.e., "question") the truth of the statement of
 utility. The evidentiary standard to be used throughout *ex
 parte* examination in setting forth a rejection is a preponderance of
 the totality of the evidence under consideration. *In re
 Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992)
 ("After evidence or argument is submitted by the applicant in response,
 patentability is determined on the totality of the record, by a preponderance of
 evidence with due consideration to persuasiveness of argument."); *In re
 Corkill,* 771 F.2d 1496, 1500, 226 USPQ 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1985). A
 preponderance of the evidence exists when it suggests that it is more likely than
 not that the assertion in question is true. *Herman**v.**Huddleston,* 459 U.S. 375, 390 (1983). To do this, Office
 personnel must provide evidence sufficient to show that the statement of asserted
 utility would be considered "false" by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Of
 course, a person of ordinary skill must have the benefit of both facts and
 reasoning in order to assess the truth of a statement. This means that if the
 applicant has presented facts that support the reasoning used in asserting a
 utility, Office personnel must present countervailing facts and reasoning
 sufficient to establish that a person of ordinary skill would not believe the
 applicant’s assertion of utility. *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34
 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The initial evidentiary standard used during
 evaluation of this question is a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., the totality
 of facts and reasoning suggest that it is more likely than not that the statement
 of the applicant is false). 
 

***B.******When Is an Asserted Utility Not Credible?***Where an applicant has specifically asserted that an invention
 has a particular utility, that assertion cannot simply be dismissed by Office
 personnel as being "wrong," even when there may be reason to believe that the
 assertion is not entirely accurate. Rather, Office personnel must determine if the
 assertion of utility is credible (i.e., whether the
 assertion of utility is believable to a person of ordinary skill in the art based
 on the totality of evidence and reasoning provided). An assertion is credible
 unless (A) the logic underlying the assertion is seriously flawed, or (B) the
 facts upon which the assertion is based are inconsistent with the logic underlying
 the assertion. Credibility as used in this context refers to the reliability of
 the statement based on the logic and facts that are offered by the applicant to
 support the assertion of utility.
 


One situation where an assertion of utility would not be
 considered credible is where a person of ordinary skill would consider the
 assertion to be "incredible in view of contemporary knowledge" and where nothing
 offered by the applicant would counter what contemporary knowledge might otherwise
 suggest. Office personnel should be careful, however, not to label certain types
 of inventions as "incredible" or "speculative" as such labels do not provide the
 correct focus for the evaluation of an assertion of utility. "Incredible utility"
 is a conclusion, not a starting point for analysis under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. A conclusion that an asserted utility is incredible can
 be reached only after the Office has evaluated both the assertion of the applicant
 regarding utility and any evidentiary basis of that
 assertion. The Office should be particularly careful not to start with a
 presumption that an asserted utility is, *per se,* "incredible"
 and then proceed to base a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** on that
 presumption.
 


Rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** based on a lack
 of credible utility have been sustained by federal courts when, for example, the
 applicant failed to disclose any utility for the invention or asserted a utility
 that could only be true if it violated a scientific principle, such as the second
 law of thermodynamics, or a law of nature, or was wholly
 inconsistent with contemporary knowledge in the art. *In re
 Gazave,* 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967). Special care
 should be taken when assessing the credibility of an asserted therapeutic utility
 for a claimed invention. In such cases, a previous lack of success in treating a
 disease or condition, or the absence of a proven animal model for testing the
 effectiveness of drugs for treating a disorder in humans, should not, standing
 alone, serve as a basis for challenging the asserted utility under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. See **[MPEP § 2107.03](s2107.html#d0e200058)** for additional
 guidance with regard to therapeutic or pharmacological utilities.
 

**IV.** **INITIAL BURDEN IS ON THE OFFICE TO ESTABLISH A *PRIMA FACIE*
 CASE AND PROVIDE EVIDENTIARY SUPPORT THEREOF**To properly reject a claimed invention under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**,
 the Office must (A) make a *prima facie* showing that the claimed
 invention lacks utility, and (B) provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for factual
 assumptions relied upon in establishing the *prima facie* showing.
 *In re Gaubert,* 524 F.2d 1222, 1224, 187 USPQ 664, 666 (CCPA
 1975) "Accordingly, the PTO must do more than merely question operability - it must
 set forth factual reasons which would lead one skilled in the art to question the
 objective truth of  the statement of operability." If the Office cannot develop a
 proper *prima facie* case and provide evidentiary support for a
 rejection under **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, a rejection on this ground should not be imposed.
 See, e.g., *In re Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443,
 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("[T]he examiner bears the initial burden, on review of the
 prior art or on any other ground, of presenting a *prima facie* case
 of unpatentability. If that burden is met, the burden of coming forward with evidence
 or argument shifts to the applicant.... If examination at the initial stage does not
 produce a *prima facie* case of unpatentability, then without more
 the applicant is entitled to grant of the patent."). See also
 *Fregeau**v.**Mossinghoff,* 776 F.2d 1034, 227 USPQ 848 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (applying *prima facie* case law to **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**);
 *In re Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 223 USPQ 785 (Fed. Cir. 1984). 
 


The *prima facie* showing must be set forth in a
 well-reasoned statement. Any rejection based on lack of utility should include a
 detailed explanation why the claimed invention has no specific and substantial
 credible utility. Whenever possible, the examiner should provide documentary evidence
 regardless of publication date (e.g., scientific or technical journals, excerpts from
 treatises or books, or U.S. or foreign patents) to support the factual basis for the
 *prima facie* showing of no specific and substantial credible
 utility. If documentary evidence is not available, the examiner should specifically
 explain the scientific basis for the examiner's factual conclusions.
 


 Where the asserted utility is not specific or substantial, a
 *prima facie* showing must establish that it is more likely than
 not that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not consider that any utility
 asserted by the applicant would be specific and substantial. The *prima
 facie* showing must contain the following elements:
 


* (A) An explanation that clearly sets forth the reasoning used in
 concluding that the asserted utility for the claimed invention is neither both
 specific and substantial nor well-established;
* (B) Support for factual findings relied upon in reaching this
 conclusion; and
* (C) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of record, including
 utilities taught in the closest prior art.


Where the asserted specific and substantial utility is not credible,
 a *prima facie* showing of no specific and substantial credible
 utility must establish that it is more likely than not that a person skilled in the
 art would not consider credible any specific and substantial utility asserted by the
 applicant for the claimed invention. The *prima facie* showing must
 contain the following elements:
 


* (A) An explanation that clearly sets forth the reasoning used in
 concluding that the asserted specific and substantial utility is not
 credible;
* (B) Support for factual findings relied upon in reaching this
 conclusion; and
* (C) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of record, including
 utilities taught in the closest prior art.


Where no specific and substantial utility is disclosed or is
 well-established, a *prima facie* showing of no specific and
 substantial utility need only establish that applicant has not asserted a utility and
 that, on the record before the examiner, there is no known well-established
 utility.
 


It is imperative that Office personnel use specificity in setting
 forth and initial rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and support any
 factual conclusions made in the *prima facie* showing. 
 


By using specificity, the applicant will be able to identify the
 assumptions made by the Office in setting forth the rejection and will be able to
 address those assumptions properly.
 


Use form paragraphs **[7.04.01](#fp7.04.01)** and
 **[7.05.02](#fp7.05.02)**
 through **[7.05.04](#fp.7.05.04)** to reject claims under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 for failure to satisfy the utility requirement.

 Specifically, because the claimed invention is not supported by either a **[5]**
 asserted utility or a well established utility for the reasons set forth above, one skilled in
 the art clearly would not know how to use the claimed invention.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. Where the specification would not enable one skilled in the art to
 make the claimed invention, or where alternative reasons support the enablement
 rejection, a separate rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, enablement should be made using the factors
 set forth in *In re Wands*, 858 F.2d 731, 8 USPQ2d 1400 (Fed. Cir.
 1988) and an undue experimentation analysis. See **[MPEP §§ 2164](s2164.html#d0e215224)** - **[2164.08(c)](s2164.html#d0e216899)**.
* 2. Use Format A, B, or C below as
 appropriate.
	+ Format A:- (a) Insert the same claim numbers in
		 brackets 1 and 4.
		- (b) Insert --specific and substantial--
		 in inserts 2 and 5.
		- (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation
		 as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a specific and
		 substantial asserted utility or a well established
		 utility.
		- (d) Format A is to be used when there is
		 no asserted utility and when there is an asserted utility but that
		 utility is not specific and substantial.
	+ Format B:- (a) Insert the same claim numbers in
		 brackets 1 and 4.
		- (b) Insert --credible-- in inserts 2 and
		 5.
		- (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation
		 as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a credible
		 asserted utility or a well established utility.
	+ Format C:- For claims that have multiple utilities, some of which
		 are not specific and substantial, some of which are not credible, but none of
		 which are specific, substantial and credible:
			* (a) Insert the same claim numbers in brackets 1 and
			 4.
			* (b) Insert --specific and substantial asserted
			 utility, a credible-- in inserts 2 and 5.
			* (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation as to why the
			 claimed invention is not supported by either a specific and substantial
			 asserted utility, a credible asserted utility or a well established
			 utility. Each utility should be addressed.


**V.** **EVIDENTIARY REQUESTS BY AN EXAMINER TO SUPPORT AN ASSERTED UTILITY**In appropriate situations the Office may require an applicant to
 substantiate an asserted utility for a claimed invention. See *In re
 Pottier,* 376 F.2d 328, 330, 153 USPQ 407, 408 (CCPA 1967) ("When the
 operativeness of any process would be deemed unlikely by one of ordinary skill in the
 art, it is not improper for the examiner to call for evidence of operativeness.").
 See also *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 1327, 206 USPQ 885, 890
 (CCPA 1980); *In re Citron,* 325 F.2d 248, 139 USPQ 516 (CCPA 1963);
  *In re Novak,* 306 F.2d 924, 928, 134 USPQ 335, 337 (CCPA1962).
 In *In re Citron,* the court held that when an "alleged utility
 appears to be incredible in the light of the knowledge of the art, or factually
 misleading, applicant must establish the asserted utility by acceptable proof." 325
 F.2d at 253, 139 USPQ at 520. The court approved of the board’s decision which
 affirmed the rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** "in view
 of the art knowledge of the lack of a cure for cancer and the absence of any
 clinical data to substantiate the allegation." 325 F.2d at 252, 139
 USPQ at 519 (emphasis in original). The court thus established a higher burden on the
 applicant where the statement of use is incredible or misleading. In such a case, the
 examiner should challenge the use and require sufficient evidence of operativeness.
 The purpose of this authority is to enable an applicant to cure an otherwise
 defective factual basis for the operability of an invention. Because this is a
 curative authority (e.g., evidence is requested to enable an applicant to support an
 assertion that is inconsistent with the facts of record in the application), Office
 personnel should indicate not only why the factual record is defective in relation to
 the assertions of the applicant, but also, where appropriate, what type of
 evidentiary showing can be provided by the applicant to remedy the problem.
 


Requests for additional evidence should be imposed rarely, and only
 if necessary to support the scientific credibility of the asserted utility (e.g., if
 the asserted utility is not consistent with the evidence of record and current
 scientific knowledge). As the Federal Circuit recently noted, "[o]nly after the PTO
 provides evidence showing that one of ordinary skill in the art would reasonably
 doubt the asserted utility does the burden shift to the applicant to provide rebuttal
 evidence sufficient to convince such a person of the invention’s asserted utility."
 *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995)
 (citing *In re Bundy,* 642 F.2d 430, 433, 209 USPQ 48, 51 (CCPA
 1981)). In *Brana,* the court pointed out that the purpose of
 treating cancer with chemical compounds does not
 suggest, *per se,* an incredible utility. Where the prior
 art disclosed "structurally similar compounds to those claimed by applicants which
 have been proven *in vivo* to be effective as chemotherapeutic
 agents against various tumor models . . ., one skilled in the art would be without
 basis to reasonably doubt applicants’ asserted utility on its face." 51 F.3d at 1566,
 34 USPQ2d at 1441. As courts have stated, "it is clearly improper for the examiner to
 make a demand for further test data, which as evidence would be essentially redundant
 and would seem to serve for nothing except perhaps to unduly burden the applicant."
 *In re Isaacs,* 347 F.2d 887, 890, 146 USPQ 193, 196 (CCPA
 1965).
 

**VI.** **CONSIDERATION OF A REPLY TO A *PRIMA FACIE* REJECTION FOR
 LACK OF UTILITY**If a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** has been properly
 imposed, along with a corresponding rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut the *prima
 facie* showing. *In re Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24
 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("The examiner bears the initial burden, on review
 of the prior art or on any other ground, of presenting a *prima
 facie* case of unpatentability. If that burden is met, the burden of
 coming forward with evidence or argument shifts to the applicant. . . After evidence
 or argument is submitted by the applicant in response, patentability is determined on
 the totality of the record, by a preponderance of evidence with due consideration to
 persuasiveness of argument."). An applicant can do this using any combination of the
 following: amendments to the claims, arguments or reasoning, or new evidence
 submitted in an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)**, or in a printed
 publication. New evidence provided by an applicant must be relevant to the issues
 raised in the rejection. For example, declarations in which conclusions are set forth
 without establishing a nexus between those conclusions and the supporting evidence,
 or which merely express opinions, may be of limited probative value with regard to
 rebutting a *prima facie* case. *In re Grunwell,*
 609 F.2d 486, 203 USPQ 1055 (CCPA 1979); *In re Buchner,* 929 F.2d
 660, 18 USPQ2d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1991). See **[MPEP § 716.01(a)](s716.html#d0e92557)** through
 **[MPEP
 § 716.01(c)](s716.html#d0e92659)**.
 


If the applicant responds to the *prima facie*
 rejection, Office personnel should review the original disclosure, any evidence
 relied upon in establishing the *prima facie* showing, any claim
 amendments, and any new reasoning or evidence provided by the applicant in support of
 an asserted specific and substantial credible utility. It is essential for Office
 personnel to recognize, fully consider and respond to each substantive element of any
 response to a rejection based on lack of utility. Only where the totality of the
 record continues to show that the asserted utility is not specific, substantial, and
 credible should a rejection based on lack of utility be maintained. If the record as
 a whole would make it more likely than not that the asserted utility for the claimed
 invention would be considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art, the
 Office cannot maintain the rejection. *In re Rinehart,* 531 F.2d
 1048, 1052, 189 USPQ 143, 147 (CCPA 1976).
 

**VII.** **EVALUATION OF EVIDENCE RELATED TO UTILITY**There is no predetermined amount or character of evidence that must
 be provided by an applicant to support an asserted utility, therapeutic or otherwise.
 Rather, the character and amount of evidence needed to support an asserted utility
 will vary depending on what is claimed *(Ex parte Ferguson,* 117
 USPQ 229 (Bd. App. 1957)), and whether the asserted utility appears to contravene
 established scientific principles and beliefs. *In re Gazave,* 379
 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967); *In re Chilowsky,*
 229 F.2d 457, 462, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956). Furthermore, the applicant does not
 have to provide evidence sufficient to establish that an asserted utility is true
 "beyond a reasonable doubt." *In re Irons,* 340 F.2d 974, 978, 144
 USPQ 351, 354 (CCPA 1965). Nor must an applicant provide evidence such that it
 establishes an asserted utility as a matter of statistical certainty.
 *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856-57, 206 USPQ 881, 883-84 (CCPA 1980)
 (reversing the Board and rejecting Bowler’s arguments that the evidence of utility
 was statistically insignificant. The court pointed out that a rigorous correlation is
 not necessary when the test is reasonably predictive of the response). See also
 *Rey-Bellet**v.**Englehardt,* 493 F.2d 1380, 181 USPQ 453 (CCPA 1974) (data from
 animal testing is relevant to asserted human therapeutic utility if there is a
 "satisfactory correlation between the effect on the animal and that ultimately
 observed in human beings"). Instead, evidence will be sufficient if, considered as a
 whole, it leads a person of ordinary skill in the art to conclude that the asserted
 utility is more likely than not true.
 




# 2107.03 Special Considerations for Asserted Therapeutic or
 Pharmacological Utilities [R-08.2012]


The federal courts have consistently reversed rejections by the Office
 asserting a lack of utility for inventions claiming a pharmacological or therapeutic
 utility where an applicant has provided evidence that reasonably supports such a
 utility. In view of this, Office personnel should be particularly careful in their
 review of evidence provided in support of an asserted therapeutic or pharmacological
 utility.
 

**I.** **A REASONABLE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE EVIDENCE AND THE ASSERTED UTILITY IS
 SUFFICIENT**As a general matter, evidence of pharmacological or other biological
 activity of a compound will be relevant to an asserted therapeutic use if there is a
 reasonable correlation between the activity in question and
 the asserted utility. *Cross**v. Iizuka,* 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985);
 *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980);
 *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 206 USPQ 881 (CCPA 1980). An applicant can
 establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically relevant data
 documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or reasoning,
 documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any combination
 thereof. The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists between a
 particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a matter of
 statistical certainty, nor does he or she have to provide actual evidence of success
 in treating humans where such a utility is asserted. Instead, as the courts have
 repeatedly held, all that is required is a reasonable correlation between the
 activity and the asserted use. *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 857, 206 USPQ 881, 884 (CCPA 1980).
 

**II.** **STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY TO COMPOUNDS WITH ESTABLISHED UTILITY**Courts have routinely found evidence of structural similarity to a
 compound known to have a particular therapeutic or pharmacological utility as being
 supportive of an assertion of therapeutic utility for a new compound. In *In
 re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980), the claimed
 compounds were found to have utility based on a finding of a close structural
 relationship to daunorubicin and doxorubicin and shared pharmacological activity with
 those compounds, both of which were known to be useful in cancer chemotherapy. The
 evidence of close structural similarity with the known compounds was presented in
 conjunction with evidence demonstrating substantial activity of the claimed
 compounds in animals customarily employed for screening anticancer agents. Such
 evidence should be given appropriate weight in determining whether one skilled in the
 art would find the asserted utility credible. Office personnel should evaluate not
 only the existence of the structural relationship, but also the reasoning used by the
 applicant or a declarant to explain why that structural similarity is believed to be
 relevant to the applicant's assertion of utility.
 

**III.** **DATA FROM *IN VITRO* OR ANIMAL TESTING IS GENERALLY
 SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THERAPEUTIC UTILITY**If reasonably correlated to the particular therapeutic or
 pharmacological utility, data generated using *in vitro* assays, or
 from testing in an animal model or a combination thereof almost invariably will be
 sufficient to establish therapeutic or pharmacological utility for a compound,
 composition or process. A cursory review of cases involving therapeutic inventions
 where **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** was the dispositive issue illustrates the fact that the
 federal courts are not particularly receptive to rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 based on inoperability. Most striking is the fact that in those cases where an
 applicant supplied a reasonable evidentiary showing supporting an asserted
 therapeutic utility, almost uniformly the **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**-based rejection was
 reversed. See, e.g., *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ 1436 (Fed.
 Cir. 1995); *Cross**v. Iizuka,* 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985);
 *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980);
 *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980);
 *In re Malachowski,* 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1976);
 *In re Gaubert,* 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1975);
 *In re Gazave,* 379 F.2d 973, 154 USPQ 92 (CCPA 1967);
 *In re Hartop,* 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962);
 *In re Krimmel,* 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961). Only in
 those cases where the applicant was unable to come forward with any relevant evidence
 to rebut a finding by the Office that the claimed invention was inoperative was a
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** rejection affirmed by the court. *In re
 Citron,* 325 F.2d 248, 253, 139 USPQ 516, 520 (CCPA 1963) (therapeutic
 utility for an uncharacterized biological extract not supported or scientifically
 credible); *In re Buting,* 418 F.2d 540, 543, 163 USPQ 689, 690
 (CCPA 1969) (record did not establish a credible basis for the assertion that the
 single class of compounds in question would be useful in treating disparate types of
 cancers); *In re Novak,* 306 F.2d 924, 134 USPQ 335 (CCPA 1962)
 (claimed compounds did not have capacity to effect physiological activity upon which
 utility claim based). Contrast, however, *In re Buting* to
 *In re Gardner,* 475 F.2d 1389, 177 USPQ 396 (CCPA 1973),
 *reh'g denied,* 480 F.2d 879 (CCPA 1973), in which the court held
 that utility for a genus was found to be supported through a showing of utility for
 one species. In no case has a federal court required an applicant to support an
 asserted utility with data from human clinical trials.
 


If an applicant provides data, whether from *in
 vitro* assays or animal tests or both, to support an asserted utility,
 and an explanation of why that data supports the asserted utility, the Office will
 determine if the data and the explanation would be viewed by one skilled in the art
 as being reasonably predictive of the asserted utility. See, e.g., *Ex parte
 Maas,* 9 USPQ2d 1746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987); *Ex parte
 Balzarini,* 21 USPQ2d 1892 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991). Office
 personnel must be careful to evaluate all factors that might influence the
 conclusions of a person of ordinary skill in the art as to this question, including
 the test parameters, choice of animal, relationship of the activity to the particular
 disorder to be treated, characteristics of the compound or composition, relative
 significance of the data provided and, most importantly, the explanation offered by
 the applicant as to why the information provided is believed to support the asserted
 utility. If the data supplied is consistent with the asserted utility, the Office
 cannot maintain a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 


Evidence does not have to be in the form of data from an
 art-recognized animal model for the particular disease or disease condition to which
 the asserted utility relates. Data from any test that the applicant reasonably
 correlates to the asserted utility should be evaluated substantively. Thus, an
 applicant may provide data generated using a particular animal model with an
 appropriate explanation as to why that data supports the asserted utility. The
 absence of a certification that the test in question is an industry-accepted model is
 not dispositive of whether data from an animal model is in fact relevant to the
 asserted utility. Thus, if one skilled in the art would accept the animal tests as
 being reasonably predictive of utility in humans, evidence
 from those tests should be considered sufficient to support the credibility of the
 asserted utility. *In re Hartop,* 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA
 1962); *In re Krimmel,* 292 F.2d 948, 953, 130 USPQ 215, 219 (CCPA
 1961); *Ex parte Krepelka,* 231 USPQ 746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1986). Office personnel should be careful not to find evidence unpersuasive simply
 because no animal model for the human disease condition had been established prior to
 the filing of the application. See *In re Chilowsky,* 229 F.2d 457,
 461, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956) ("The mere fact that something has not previously
 been done clearly is not, in itself, a sufficient basis for rejecting all
 applications purporting to disclose how to do it."); *In re Wooddy,*
 331 F.2d 636, 639, 141 USPQ 518, 520 (CCPA 1964) ("It appears that no one on earth is
 certain as of the present whether the process claimed will operate in the manner
 claimed. Yet absolute certainty is not required by the law. The mere fact that
 something has not previously been done clearly is not, in itself, a sufficient basis
 for rejecting all applications purporting to disclose how to do it.").
 

**IV.** **HUMAN CLINICAL DATA**Office personnel should not impose on applicants the unnecessary
 burden of providing evidence from human clinical trials. There is no decisional law
 that requires an applicant to provide data from human clinical trials to establish
 utility for an invention related to treatment of human disorders (see *In re
 Isaacs,* 347 F.2d 889, 146 USPQ 193 (CCPA 1963); *In re
 Langer,* 503 F.2d 1380, 183 USPQ 288 (CCPA 1974)), even with respect to
 situations where no art-recognized animal models existed for the human disease
 encompassed by the claims. *Ex parte Balzarini,* 21 USPQ2d 1892 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1991) (human clinical data is not required to demonstrate the
 utility of the claimed invention, even though those skilled in the art might not
 accept other evidence to establish the efficacy of the claimed therapeutic
 compositions and the operativeness of the claimed methods of treating humans). Before
 a drug can enter human clinical trials, the sponsor, often the
 applicant, must provide a convincing rationale to those
 especially skilled in the art (e.g., the Food and Drug
 Administration (FDA)) that the investigation may be successful. Such a rationale
 would provide a basis for the sponsor’s expectation that the investigation may be
 successful. In order to determine a protocol for phase I testing, the first phase of
 clinical investigation, some credible rationale of how the drug might be effective or
 could be effective would be necessary. Thus, as a general rule, if an
 applicant has initiated human clinical trials for a therapeutic product or
 process, Office personnel should presume that the applicant has established that
 the subject matter of that trial is reasonably predictive of having the asserted
 therapeutic utility.

**V.** **SAFETY AND EFFICACY CONSIDERATIONS**The Office must confine its review of patent applications to the
 statutory requirements of the patent law. Other agencies of the government have been
 assigned the responsibility of ensuring conformance to standards established by
 statute for the advertisement, use, sale or distribution of drugs. The FDA pursues a
 two-prong test to provide approval for testing. Under that test, a sponsor must show
 that the investigation does not pose an unreasonable and significant risk of illness
 or injury and that there is an acceptable rationale for the study. As a review
 matter, there must be a rationale for believing that the compound could be effective.
 If the use reviewed by the FDA is not set forth in the specification, FDA review may
 not satisfy **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. However, if the reviewed use is one set forth in
 the specification, Office personnel must be extremely hesitant to challenge utility.
 In such a situation, experts at the FDA have assessed the rationale for the drug or
 research study upon which an asserted utility is based and found it satisfactory.
 Thus, in challenging utility, Office personnel must be able to carry their burden
 that there is no sound rationale for the asserted utility even though experts
 designated by Congress to decide the issue have come to an opposite conclusion. "FDA
 approval, however, is not a prerequisite for finding a compound useful within the
 meaning of the patent laws." *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d
 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citing *Scott**v.**Finney,* 34 F.3d 1058, 1063, 32 USPQ2d 1115, 1120 (Fed. Cir.
 1994)).
 


Thus, while an applicant may on occasion need to provide evidence to
 show that an invention will work as claimed, it is improper for Office personnel to
 request evidence of safety in the treatment of humans, or regarding the
 degree of effectiveness. See *In re
 Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977); *In re
 Hartop,* 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962); *In re
 Anthony,* 414 F.2d 1383, 162 USPQ 594 (CCPA 1969); *In re
 Watson,* 517 F.2d 465, 186 USPQ 11 (CCPA 1975); *In re
 Krimmel,* 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961); *Ex parte
 Jovanovics,* 211 USPQ 907 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1981).
 

**VI.** **TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISEASE CONDITIONS**Claims directed to a method of treating or curing a disease for
 which there have been no previously successful treatments or cures warrant careful
 review for compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. The credibility of
 an asserted utility for treating a human disorder may be more difficult to establish
 where current scientific understanding suggests that such a task would be impossible.
 Such a determination has always required a good understanding of the state of the art
 as of the time that the invention was made. For example, prior to the 1980’s, there
 were a number of cases where an asserted use in treating cancer in humans was viewed
 as "incredible." *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA
 1980); *In re Buting,* 418 F.2d 540, 163 USPQ 689 (CCPA 1969);
 *Ex parte Stevens,* 16 USPQ2d 1379 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1990); *Ex parte Busse,* 1 USPQ2d 1908 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1986); *Ex parte Krepelka,* 231 USPQ 746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1986); *Ex parte Jovanovics,* 211 USPQ 907 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1981). The fact that there is no known cure for a disease, however, cannot
 serve as the basis for a conclusion that such an invention lacks utility. Rather,
 Office personnel must determine if the asserted utility for the invention is credible
 based on the information disclosed in the application. Only those claims for which an
 asserted utility is not credible should be rejected. In such
 cases, the Office should carefully review what is being claimed by the applicant. An
 assertion that the claimed invention is useful in treating a symptom of an incurable
 disease may be considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art on the
 basis of a fairly modest amount of evidence or support. In contrast, an assertion
 that the claimed invention will be useful in "curing" the disease may require a
 significantly greater amount of evidentiary support to be considered credible by a
 person of ordinary skill in the art. *In re Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154,
 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977); *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ
 885 (CCPA 1980). See also *Ex parte Ferguson,* 117 USPQ 229 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1957).
 


In these cases, it is important to note that the Food and Drug
 Administration has promulgated regulations that enable a party to conduct clinical
 trials for drugs used to treat life threatening and severely-debilitating illnesses,
 even where no alternative therapy exists. See 21 CFR 312.80-88 (1994). Implicit in
 these regulations is the recognition that experts qualified to evaluate the
 effectiveness of therapeutics can and often do find a sufficient basis to conduct
 clinical trials of drugs for incurable or previously untreatable illnesses. Thus,
 affidavit evidence from experts in the art indicating that there is a reasonable
 expectation of success, supported by sound reasoning, usually should be sufficient to
 establish that such a utility is credible.

# 2107.01 General Principles Governing Utility Rejections [R-10.2019]



#### *35 U.S.C. 101   
 Inventions patentable*


Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,
 manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may
 obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this
 title.
 



See **[MPEP
 § 2107](s2107.html#d0e198469)** for guidelines for the examination of applications for
 compliance with the utility requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 


The Office must examine each application to ensure compliance with the
 "useful invention" or utility requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. In discharging this
 obligation, however, Office personnel must keep in mind several general principles that
 control application of the utility requirement. **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** has been interpreted
 as imposing four purposes. First, **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** limits an inventor to
 ONE patent for a claimed invention. If more than one patent is sought, a patent
 applicant will receive a statutory double patenting rejection for claims included in
 more than one application that are directed to the same invention. See
  **[MPEP §
 804](s804.html#d0e98894)**. Second, the inventor(s) must be the applicant in an
 application filed before September 16, 2012, (except as otherwise provided in
 **[pre-AIA 37 CFR
 1.41(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317757)**) and the inventor or each joint inventor must be
 identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012. See
 **[MPEP §
 2109](s2109.html#ch2100_d2c183_22374_28b)** for a detailed discussion of inventorship,
 **[MPEP §
 602.01(c)](s602.html#d0e4830ss602)***et seq.* for details regarding correction of inventorship,
 **[MPEP §
 2157](s2157.html#ch2100_d20034_1bb92_e7)** for rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[115](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302875912)** for failure
 to set forth the correct inventorship, and **[MPEP § 2137](s2137.html#d0e206570)** for rejections under
 **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102(f)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302420)** (for applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**) for failure to set forth the correct inventorship. Third,
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** defines which categories of inventions are eligible for patent
 protection. An invention that is not a machine, an article of manufacture, a composition
 or a process cannot be patented. See *Diamond**v.**Chakrabarty,* 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980);
 *Diamond**v.**Diehr,* 450 U.S. 175, 209 USPQ 1 (1981); *In re
 Nuijten,* 500 F.3d 1346, 1354, 84 USPQ2d 1495, 1500 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
 Fourth, **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** serves to ensure that patents are granted on only those
 inventions that are "useful." This second purpose has a Constitutional footing — Article
 I, Section 8 of the Constitution authorizes Congress to provide exclusive rights to
 inventors to promote the "useful arts." See *Carl Zeiss Stiftung**v.**Renishaw PLC,* 945 F.2d 1173, 20 USPQ2d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Thus,
 to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, an applicant must
 claim an invention that is statutory subject matter and must show that the claimed
 invention is "useful" for some purpose either explicitly or implicitly. Application of
 this latter element of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** is the focus of these guidelines.
 


Deficiencies under the "useful invention" requirement of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** will arise in one of two forms. The first is where it is not
 apparent why the invention is "useful." This can occur when an applicant fails to
 identify any specific and substantial utility for the invention or fails to disclose
 enough information about the invention to make its usefulness immediately apparent to
 those familiar with the technological field of the invention. *Brenner**v.**Manson,* 383 U.S. 519, 148 USPQ 689 (1966); *In re
 Fisher,* 421 F.3d 1365, 76 USPQ2d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2005); *In re
 Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 26 USPQ2d 1600 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The second type of
 deficiency arises in the rare instance where an assertion of specific and substantial
 utility for the invention made by an applicant is not credible.
 

**I.** **SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIAL REQUIREMENTS**To satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, an invention must
 be "useful." Courts have recognized that the term "useful" used with reference to the
 utility requirement can be a difficult term to define. *Brenner**v.**Manson,* 383 U.S. 519, 529, 148 USPQ 689, 693 (1966) (simple
 everyday word like "useful" can be "pregnant with ambiguity when applied to the facts
 of life."). Where an applicant has set forth a specific and substantial utility,
 courts have been reluctant to uphold a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 solely on the basis that the applicant’s opinion as to the nature of the specific and
 substantial utility was inaccurate. For example, in *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 206 USPQ 881 (CCPA 1980), the court reversed
 a finding by the Office that the applicant had not set forth a "practical" utility
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. In this case the applicant asserted that the composition
 was "useful" in a particular pharmaceutical application and provided evidence to
 support that assertion. Courts have used the labels "practical utility," "substantial
 utility," or "specific utility" to refer to this aspect of the "useful invention"
 requirement of **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has
 stated:
 



> 
> Practical utility is a shorthand way of attributing "real-world"
>  value to claimed subject matter. In other words, one skilled in the art can use a
>  claimed discovery in a manner which provides some immediate benefit to the
>  public.
>  
> 
> 
> 


*Nelson v. Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA
 1980).
 


Practical considerations require the Office to rely on the
 inventor’s understanding of the invention in determining whether and in what regard
 an invention is believed to be "useful." Because of this, Office personnel should
 focus on and be receptive to assertions made by the applicant that an invention is
 "useful" for a particular reason. 
 

***A.******Specific Utility***A "specific utility" is *specific* to the
 subject matter claimed and can "provide a well-defined and particular benefit to
 the public." *In re Fisher,* 421 F.3d 1365, 1371, 76 USPQ2d 1225,
 1230 (Fed. Cir. 2005). This contrasts with a *general* utility
 that would be applicable to the broad class of the invention. Office personnel
 should distinguish between situations where an applicant has disclosed a specific
 use for or application of the invention and situations where the applicant merely
 indicates that the invention may prove useful without identifying with specificity
 why it is considered useful. For example, indicating that a
 compound may be useful in treating unspecified disorders, or that the compound has
 "useful biological" properties, would not be sufficient to define a specific
 utility for the compound. See, e.g., *In re Kirk,* 376 F.2d 936,
 153 USPQ 48 (CCPA 1967); *In re Joly,* 376 F.2d 906, 153 USPQ 45
 (CCPA 1967). Similarly, a claim to a polynucleotide whose use is disclosed simply
 as a "gene probe" or "chromosome marker" would not be considered to be
 *specific* in the absence of a disclosure of a specific DNA
 target. See *In re Fisher,* 421 F.3d at 1374, 76 USPQ2d at 1232
 ("Any EST [expressed sequence tag] transcribed from any gene in the maize genome
 has the potential to perform any one of the alleged uses…. Nothing about
 [applicant’s] seven alleged uses set the five claimed ESTs apart from the more
 than 32,000 ESTs disclosed in the [ ] application or indeed from any EST derived
 from any organism. Accordingly, we conclude that [applicant] has only disclosed
 general uses for its claimed ESTs, not specific ones that satisfy
 **[§
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**."). A general statement of diagnostic utility, such as
 diagnosing an unspecified disease, would ordinarily be insufficient absent a
 disclosure of what condition can be diagnosed. Contrast the situation where an
 applicant discloses a specific biological activity and reasonably correlates that
 activity to a disease condition. Assertions falling within the latter category are
 sufficient to identify a specific utility for the invention. Assertions that fall
 in the former category are insufficient to define a specific utility for the
 invention, especially if the assertion takes the form of a general statement that
 makes it clear that a "useful" invention may arise from
 what has been disclosed by the applicant. *Knapp v.**Anderson,* 477 F.2d 588, 177 USPQ 688 (CCPA 1973).
 

***B.******Substantial Utility*** "[A]n application must show that an invention is useful to the
 public as disclosed in its current form, not that it may prove useful at some
 future date after further research. Simply put, to satisfy the ‘substantial’
 utility requirement, an asserted use must show that the claimed invention has a
 significant and presently available benefit to the public."
 *Fisher,* 421 F.3d at 1371, 76 USPQ2d at 1230. The claims at
 issue in *Fisher* were directed to expressed sequence tags
 (ESTs), which are short nucleotide sequences that can be used to discover what
 genes and downstream proteins are expressed in a cell. The court held that "the
 claimed ESTs can be used only to gain further information about the underlying
 genes and the proteins encoded for by those genes. The claimed ESTs themselves are
 not an end of [applicant’s] research effort, but only tools to be used along the
 way in the search for a practical utility…. [Applicant] does not identify the
 function for the underlying protein-encoding genes. Absent such identification, we
 hold that the claimed ESTs have not been researched and understood to the point of
 providing an immediate, well-defined, real world benefit to the public meriting
 the grant of a patent." *Id.* at 1376, 76 USPQ2d at 1233-34).
 Thus a "substantial utility" defines a "real world" use. Utilities that require or
 constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a "real
 world" context of use are not substantial utilities. For example, both a
 therapeutic method of treating a known or newly discovered disease and an assay
 method for identifying compounds that themselves have a "substantial utility"
 define a "real world" context of use. An assay that measures the presence of a
 material which has a stated correlation to a predisposition to the onset of a
 particular disease condition would also define a "real world" context of use in
 identifying potential candidates for preventive measures or further monitoring. On
 the other hand, the following are examples of situations that require or
 constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a "real
 world" context of use and, therefore, do not define "substantial utilities":
 


* (A) Basic research such as studying the properties of the
 claimed product itself or the mechanisms in which the material is
 involved;
* (B) A method of treating an *unspecified*
 disease or condition;
* (C) A method of assaying for or identifying a material that
 itself has no specific and/or substantial utility;
* (D) A method of making a material that itself has no specific,
 substantial, and credible utility; and
* (E) A claim to an intermediate product for use in making a
 final product that has no specific, substantial and credible utility.


Office personnel must be careful not to interpret the phrase
 "immediate benefit to the public" or similar formulations in other cases to mean
 that products or services based on the claimed invention must be "currently
 available" to the public in order to satisfy the utility requirement. See, e.g.,
 *Brenner v. Manson,* 383 U.S. 519, 534-35, 148 USPQ 689, 695
 (1966). Rather, any reasonable use that an applicant has identified for the
 invention that can be viewed as providing a public benefit should be accepted as
 sufficient, at least with regard to defining a "substantial" utility.
 

***C.******Research Tools***Some confusion can result when one attempts to label certain
 types of inventions as not being capable of having a specific and substantial
 utility based on the setting in which the invention is to be used. One example is
 inventions to be used in a research or laboratory setting. Many research tools
 such as gas chromatographs, screening assays, and nucleotide sequencing techniques
 have a clear, specific and unquestionable utility (e.g., they are useful in
 analyzing compounds). An assessment that focuses on whether an invention is useful
 only in a research setting thus does not address whether the invention is in fact
 "useful" in a patent sense. Instead, Office personnel must distinguish between
 inventions that have a specifically identified substantial utility and inventions
 whose asserted utility requires further research to identify or reasonably
 confirm. Labels such as "research tool," "intermediate" or "for research purposes"
 are not helpful in determining if an applicant has identified a specific and
 substantial utility for the invention. 
 

**II.** **WHOLLY INOPERATIVE INVENTIONS; "INCREDIBLE" UTILITY**An invention that is "inoperative" (i.e., it does not operate to
 produce the results claimed by the patent applicant) is not a "useful" invention in
 the meaning of the patent law. See, e.g., *Newman**v.**Quigg,* 877 F.2d 1575, 1581, 11 USPQ2d 1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 1989);
 *In re Harwood,* 390 F.2d 985, 989, 156 USPQ 673, 676 (CCPA 1968)
 ("An inoperative invention, of course, does not satisfy the requirement of
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** that an invention be useful."). However, as the Federal
 Circuit has stated, "[t]o violate **[[35 U.S.C.] 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** the claimed
 device must be totally incapable of achieving a useful
 result." *Brooktree Corp.**v.**Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.,* 977 F.2d 1555, 1571, 24 USPQ2d 1401,
 1412 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (emphasis added). See also *E.I. du Pont De Nemours and
 Co.**v.**Berkley and Co.,* 620 F.2d 1247, 1260 n.17, 205 USPQ 1, 10 n.17
 (8th Cir. 1980) ("A small degree of utility is sufficient . . . The claimed invention
 must only be capable of performing some beneficial function . . . An invention does
 not lack utility merely because the particular embodiment disclosed in the patent
 lacks perfection or performs crudely . . . A commercially successful product is not
 required . . . Nor is it essential that the invention accomplish all its intended
 functions . . . or operate under all conditions . . . partial success being
 sufficient to demonstrate patentable utility . . . In short, the defense of
 non-utility cannot be sustained without proof of total incapacity." If an invention
 is only partially successful in achieving a useful result, a
 rejection of the claimed invention as a whole based on a lack of utility is not
 appropriate. See *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed.
 Cir. 1995); *In re Gardner,* 475 F.2d 1389, 177 USPQ 396 (CCPA),
 *reh’g denied,* 480 F.2d 879 (CCPA 1973); *In re
 Marzocchi,* 439 F.2d 220, 169 USPQ 367 (CCPA 1971).
 


Situations where an invention is found to be "inoperative" and
 therefore lacking in utility are rare, and rejections maintained solely on this
 ground by a federal court even rarer. In many of these cases, the utility asserted by
 the applicant was thought to be "incredible in the light of the knowledge of the art,
 or factually misleading" when initially considered by the Office. *In re
 Citron,* 325 F.2d 248, 253, 139 USPQ 516, 520 (CCPA 1963). Other cases
 suggest that on initial evaluation, the Office considered the asserted utility to be
 inconsistent with known scientific principles or "speculative at best" as to whether
 attributes of the invention necessary to impart the asserted utility were actually
 present in the invention. *In re Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ
 209 (CCPA 1977). However cast, the underlying finding by the court in these cases was
 that, based on the factual record of the case, it was clear
 that the invention could not and did not work as the inventor claimed it did. Indeed,
 the use of many labels to describe a single problem (e.g., a false assertion
 regarding utility) has led to some of the confusion that exists today with regard to
 a rejection based on the "utility" requirement. Examples of such cases include: an
 invention asserted to change the taste of food using a magnetic field
 *(Fregeau**v.**Mossinghoff,* 776 F.2d 1034, 227 USPQ 848 (Fed. Cir. 1985)), a
 perpetual motion machine *(Newman**v.**Quigg,* 877 F.2d 1575, 11 USPQ2d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 1989)), a flying
 machine operating on "flapping or flutter function" *(In re
 Houghton,* 433 F.2d 820, 167 USPQ 687 (CCPA 1970)), a "cold fusion"
 process for producing energy *(In re Swartz,* 232 F.3d 862, 56
 USPQ2d 1703 (Fed. Cir. 2000)), a method for increasing the energy output of fossil
 fuels upon combustion through exposure to a magnetic field *(In re
 Ruskin,* 354 F.2d 395, 148 USPQ 221 (CCPA 1966)), uncharacterized
 compositions for curing a wide array of cancers *(In re Citron,* 325
 F.2d 248, 139 USPQ 516 (CCPA 1963)), and a method of controlling the aging process
 *(In re Eltgroth,* 419 F.2d 918, 164 USPQ 221 (CCPA 1970)). These
 examples are fact specific and should not be applied as a
 *per se* rule. Thus, in view of the rare nature of such cases,
 Office personnel should not label an asserted utility "incredible," "speculative" or
 otherwise unless it is clear that a rejection based on "lack of utility" is
 proper.
 

**III.** **THERAPEUTIC OR PHARMACOLOGICAL UTILITY**Inventions asserted to have utility in the treatment of human or
 animal disorders are subject to the same legal requirements for utility as inventions
 in any other field of technology. *In re Chilowsky,* 229 F.2d 457,
 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956) ("There appears to be no basis in the statutes
 or decisions for requiring any more conclusive evidence of operativeness in one type
 of case than another. The character and amount of evidence needed may vary, depending
 on whether the alleged operation described in the application appears to accord with
 or to contravene established scientific principles or to depend upon principles
 alleged but not generally recognized, but the degree of certainty as to the ultimate
 fact of operativeness or inoperativeness should be the same in all cases");
 *In re Gazave,* 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967)
 ("Thus, in the usual case where the mode of operation alleged can be readily
 understood and conforms to the known laws of physics and chemistry, operativeness is
 not questioned, and no further evidence is required."). As such, pharmacological or
 therapeutic inventions that provide any "immediate benefit to
 the public" satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. The utility being asserted in
 *Nelson* related to a compound with pharmacological utility.
 *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980). Office
 personnel should rely on *Nelson* and other cases as providing
 general guidance when evaluating the utility of an invention that is based on any
 therapeutic, prophylactic, or pharmacological activities of that invention. 
 


Courts have repeatedly found that the mere
 identification of a pharmacological activity of a compound
 that is relevant to an asserted pharmacological use provides an "immediate benefit to
 the public" and thus satisfies the utility requirement. As the Court of Customs and
 Patent Appeals held in *Nelson**v.**Bowler*:
 



> 
> Knowledge of the pharmacological activity of any compound is
>  obviously beneficial to the public. It is inherently faster and easier to combat
>  illnesses and alleviate symptoms when the medical profession is armed with an
>  arsenal of chemicals having known pharmacological activities. Since it is crucial
>  to provide researchers with an incentive to disclose pharmacological activities in
>  as many compounds as possible, we conclude that adequate proof of any such
>  activity constitutes a showing of practical utility.
>  
> 
> 
> 


*Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980).
 


In *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* the court addressed the practical utility requirement in
 the context of an interference proceeding. Bowler challenged the patentability of the
 invention claimed by Nelson on the basis that Nelson had failed to sufficiently and
 persuasively disclose in his application a practical utility for the invention.
 Nelson had developed and claimed a class of synthetic prostaglandins modeled on
 naturally occurring prostaglandins. Naturally occurring prostaglandins are bioactive
 compounds that, at the time of Nelson’s application, had a recognized value in
 pharmacology (e.g., the stimulation of uterine smooth muscle which resulted in labor
 induction or abortion, the ability to raise or lower blood pressure, etc.). To
 support the utility he identified in his disclosure, Nelson included in his
 application the results of tests demonstrating the bioactivity of his new substituted
 prostaglandins relative to the bioactivity of naturally occurring prostaglandins. The
 court concluded that Nelson had satisfied the practical utility requirement in
 identifying the synthetic prostaglandins as pharmacologically active compounds. In
 reaching this conclusion, the court considered and rejected arguments advanced by
 Bowler that attacked the evidentiary basis for Nelson’s assertions that the compounds
 were pharmacologically active.
 


In *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885
 (CCPA 1980), an inventor claimed protection for pharmaceutical compositions for
 treating leukemia. The active ingredient in the compositions was a structural analog
 to a known anticancer agent. The applicant provided evidence showing that the claimed
 analogs had the same general pharmaceutical activity as the known anticancer agents.
 The court reversed the Board’s finding that the asserted pharmaceutical utility was
 "incredible," pointing to the evidence that showed the relevant pharmacological
 activity.
 


In *Cross**v.**Iizuka,* 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Federal
 Circuit affirmed a finding by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences that a
 pharmacological utility had been disclosed in the application of one party to an
 interference proceeding. The invention that was the subject of the interference count
 was a chemical compound used for treating blood disorders. Cross had challenged the
 evidence in Iizuka’s specification that supported the claimed utility. However, the
 Federal Circuit relied extensively on *Nelson**v.**Bowler* in finding that Iizuka’s application had sufficiently
 disclosed a pharmacological utility for the compounds. It distinguished the case from
 cases where only a generalized "nebulous" expression, such as "biological
 properties," had been disclosed in a specification. Such statements, the court held,
 "convey little explicit indication regarding the utility of a compound."
 *Cross,* 753 F.2d at 1048, 224 USPQ at 745 (citing *In re
 Kirk,* 376 F.2d 936, 941, 153 USPQ 48, 52 (CCPA 1967)).
 


Similarly, courts have found utility for therapeutic inventions
 despite the fact that an applicant is at a very early stage in the development of a
 pharmaceutical product or therapeutic regimen based on a claimed pharmacological or
 bioactive compound or composition. The Federal Circuit, in *Cross**v.**Iizuka,* 753 F.2d 1040, 1051, 224 USPQ 739, 747-48 (Fed. Cir.
 1985), commented on the significance of data from *in vitro* testing
 that showed pharmacological activity:
 



> 
> We perceive no insurmountable difficulty, under appropriate
>  circumstances, in finding that the first link in the screening chain, *in
>  vitro* testing, may establish a practical utility for the compound in
>  question. Successful *in vitro* testing will marshal resources
>  and direct the expenditure of effort to further *in vivo* testing

The Federal Circuit has reiterated that therapeutic utility
 sufficient under the patent laws is not to be confused with the requirements of the
 FDA with regard to safety and efficacy of drugs to marketed in the United States.

 Accordingly, Office personnel should not construe **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, under the logic of
 "practical" utility or otherwise, to require that an applicant demonstrate that a
 therapeutic agent based on a claimed invention is a safe or fully effective drug for
 humans. See, e.g., *In re Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209
 (CCPA 1977); *In re Hartop,* 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962);
 *In re Anthony,* 414 F.2d 1383, 162 USPQ 594 (CCPA 1969);
 *In re Watson,* 517 F.2d 465, 186 USPQ 11 (CCPA 1975).
 


These general principles are equally applicable to situations where
 an applicant has claimed a process for treating a human or animal disorder. In such
 cases, the asserted utility is usually clear — the invention is asserted to be useful
 in treating the particular disorder. If the asserted utility is
 credible, there is no basis to challenge such a claim on
 the basis that it lacks utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 


 See **[MPEP § 2107.03](s2107.html#d0e200058)** for special considerations for asserted
 therapeutic or pharmacological utilities.

 also creates a deficiency under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. See *In re
 Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995); *In re
 Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 1326 n.10, 206 USPQ 885, 889 n.11 (CCPA 1980);
 *In re Fouche,* 439 F.2d 1237, 1243, 169 USPQ 429, 434 (CCPA
 1971) ("If such compositions are in fact useless, appellant’s specification cannot
 have taught how to use them."). Courts have also cast the **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**/**[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** relationship such
 that **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** presupposes compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 See *In re Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 1200-1201, 26 USPQ2d 1600, 1603
 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("The how to use prong of **[section 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** incorporates as a
 matter of law the requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** that the
 specification disclose as a matter of fact a practical utility for the invention. ...
 If the application fails as a matter of fact to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. §
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, then the application also fails as a matter of law to enable
 one of ordinary skill in the art to use the invention under **[35 U.S.C. §
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**."); *In re Kirk,* 376 F.2d 936, 942, 153 USPQ
 48, 53 (CCPA 1967) ("Necessarily, compliance with **[§ 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)** requires a description of
 how to use presently useful inventions, otherwise an applicant would anomalously be
 required to teach how to use a useless invention."). For example, the Federal Circuit
 noted, "[o]bviously, if a claimed invention does not have utility, the specification
 cannot enable one to use it." *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d
 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). As such, a rejection properly imposed under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 for lack of utility should be accompanied with a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. It is equally clear that a rejection based on "lack of utility," whether
 grounded upon **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** or **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)**, first paragraph, rests on the same basis (i.e., the
 asserted utility is not credible). To avoid confusion, any lack of utility rejection
 that is imposed on the basis of **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** should be
 accompanied by a rejection based on **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35

 paragraph, rejection should be set out as a separate rejection that incorporates by
 reference the factual basis and conclusions set forth in the **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 rejection. The **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA
 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, rejection should indicate that
 because the invention as claimed does not have utility, a person skilled in the art
 would not be able to use the invention as claimed, and as such, the claim is
 defective under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35

 paragraph, rejection based on lack of utility should not be imposed or maintained
 unless an appropriate basis exists for imposing a utility rejection under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. In other words, Office personnel should not impose a
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, rejection grounded on a "lack of utility" basis unless a **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 rejection is proper. In particular, the factual showing needed to impose a rejection
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** must be provided if a rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, is to be imposed on "lack of utility" grounds.
 


It is important to recognize that **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, addresses matters other than those related to the question of whether or
 not an invention lacks utility. These matters include whether the claims are fully
 supported by the disclosure *(In re Vaeck,* 947 F.2d 488, 495, 20
 USPQ2d 1438, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1991)), whether the applicant has provided an enabling
 disclosure of the claimed subject matter *(In re Wright,* 999 F.2d
 1557, 1561-1562, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1513 (Fed. Cir. 1993)), whether the applicant has
 provided an adequate written description of the invention and whether the applicant
 has disclosed the best mode of practicing the claimed invention *(Chemcast
 Corp.**v.**Arco Indus. Corp.,* 913 F.2d 923, 927-928, 16 USPQ2d 1033,
 1036-1037 (Fed. Cir. 1990)). See also *Transco Products Inc.**v. Performance Contracting Inc.,* 38 F.3d 551, 32 USPQ2d 1077 (Fed.
 Cir. 1994); *Glaxo Inc.**v.**Novopharm Ltd.,* 52 F.3d 1043, 34 USPQ2d 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The
 fact that an applicant has disclosed a specific utility for an invention and provided
 a credible basis supporting that specific utility does not provide a basis for
 concluding that the claims comply with all the requirements of **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph. For example, if an applicant has claimed a process of treating a certain
 disease condition with a certain compound and provided a credible basis for asserting
 that the compound is useful in that regard, but to actually practice the invention as
 claimed a person skilled in the relevant art would have to engage in an undue amount
 of experimentation, the claim may be defective under **[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**,
 but not **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. To avoid confusion during examination, any rejection under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, based on grounds other than "lack of utility" should be imposed separately
 from any rejection imposed due to "lack of utility" under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 and **[35

 paragraph.

# 2107.02 Procedural Considerations Related to Rejections for Lack of
 Utility [R-10.2019]

**I.** **THE CLAIMED INVENTION IS THE FOCUS OF THE UTILITY REQUIREMENT**The claimed invention is the focus of the assessment of whether an
 applicant has satisfied the utility requirement. Each claim (i.e., each "invention"),
 therefore, must be evaluated on its own merits for compliance with all statutory
 requirements. Generally speaking, however, a dependent claim will define an invention
 that has utility if the independent claim from which the dependent claim depends is
 drawn to the same statutory class of invention as the dependent claim and the
 independent claim defines an invention having utility. An exception to this general
 rule is where the utility specified for the invention defined in a dependent claim
 differs from that indicated for the invention defined in the independent claim from
 which the dependent claim depends. Where an applicant has established utility for a
 species that falls within an identified genus of compounds, and presents a generic
 claim covering the genus, as a general matter, that claim should be treated as being
 sufficient under **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. Only where it can be established that other species
 clearly encompassed by the claim do not have utility should a rejection be imposed on
 the generic claim. In such cases, the applicant should be encouraged to amend the
 generic claim so as to exclude the species that lack utility. 
 


It is common and sensible for an applicant to identify several
 specific utilities for an invention, particularly where the invention is a product
 (e.g., a machine, an article of manufacture or a composition of matter). However,
 regardless of the category of invention that is claimed (e.g., product or process),
 an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific utility for the
 claimed invention to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**; additional statements of utility, even if not "credible,"
 do not render the claimed invention lacking in utility. See, e.g.,
 *Raytheon**v.**Roper,* 724 F.2d 951, 958, 220 USPQ 592, 598 (Fed. Cir. 1983),
 *cert. denied,* 469 U.S. 835 (1984) ("When a properly claimed
 invention meets at least one stated objective, utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 is clearly shown."); *In re Gottlieb,* 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ
 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) ("Having found that the antibiotic is useful for some purpose,
 it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other purposes
 ‘indicated’ in the specification as possibly useful."); *In re
 Malachowski,* 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1976);
 *Hoffman**v.**Klaus,* 9 USPQ2d 1657 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1988). Thus, if
 applicant makes one credible assertion of utility, utility for the claimed invention
 as a whole is established.
 


Statements made by the applicant in the specification or incident to
 prosecution of the application before the Office cannot, standing alone, be the basis
 for a lack of utility rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** or
 **[35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**. *Tol-O-Matic, Inc.**v.**Proma Produkt-Und Mktg. Gesellschaft m.b.h.,* 945 F.2d 1546, 1553,
 20 USPQ2d 1332, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (It is not required that a particular
 characteristic set forth in the prosecution history be achieved in order to satisfy
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.). An applicant may include statements in the specification
 whose technical accuracy cannot be easily confirmed if those statements are not
 necessary to support the patentability of an invention with regard to any statutory
 basis. Thus, the Office should not require an applicant to strike nonessential
 statements relating to utility from a patent disclosure, regardless of the technical
 accuracy of the statement or assertion it presents. Office personnel should also be
 especially careful not to read into a claim unclaimed results, limitations or
 embodiments of an invention. See *Carl Zeiss Stiftung**v.**Renishaw PLC,* 945 F.2d 1173, 20 USPQ2d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 1991);
 *In re Krimmel,* 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961). Doing so
 can inappropriately change the relationship of an asserted utility to the claimed
 invention and raise issues not relevant to examination of that claim.
 

**II.** **IS THERE AN ASSERTED OR WELL-ESTABLISHED UTILITY FOR THE CLAIMED
 INVENTION?**Upon initial examination, the examiner should review the
 specification to determine if there are any statements asserting that the claimed
 invention is useful for any particular purpose. A complete disclosure should include
 a statement which identifies a specific and substantial utility for the invention. 
 

***A.******An Asserted Utility Must Be Specific and Substantial***A statement of specific and substantial utility should fully and
 clearly explain why the applicant believes the invention is useful. Such
 statements will usually explain the purpose of or how the invention may be used
 (e.g., a compound is believed to be useful in the treatment of a particular
 disorder). Regardless of the form of statement of utility, it must enable one
 ordinarily skilled in the art to understand why the applicant believes the claimed
 invention is useful. 
 


Except where an invention has a well-established utility, the
 failure of an applicant to specifically identify why an invention is believed to
 be useful renders the claimed invention deficient under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph. In such cases, the applicant
 has failed to identify a "specific and substantial utility" for the claimed
 invention. For example, a statement that a composition has an unspecified
 "biological activity" or that does not explain why a composition with that
 activity is believed to be useful fails to set forth a "specific and substantial
 utility." *Brenner**v.**Manson,* 383 US 519, 148 USPQ 689 (1966) (general assertion of
 similarities to known compounds known to be useful without sufficient
 corresponding explanation why claimed compounds are believed to be similarly
 useful insufficient under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**); *In re
 Ziegler,* 992 F.2d 1197, 1201, 26 USPQ2d 1600, 1604 (Fed. Cir. 1993)
 (disclosure that composition is "plastic-like" and can form "films" not sufficient
 to identify specific and substantial utility for invention); *In re
 Kirk,* 376 F.2d 936, 153 USPQ 48 (CCPA 1967) (indication that compound
 is "biologically active" or has "biological properties" insufficient standing
 alone). See also *In re Joly,* 376 F.2d 906, 153 USPQ 45 (CCPA
 1967); *Kawai**v.**Metlesics,* 480 F.2d 880, 890, 178 USPQ 158, 165 (CCPA 1973)
 (contrasting description of invention as sedative which did suggest specific
 utility to general suggestion of "pharmacological effects on the central nervous
 system" which did not). In contrast, a disclosure that identifies a particular
 biological activity of a compound and explains how that activity can be utilized
 in a particular therapeutic application of the compound does contain an assertion
 of specific and substantial utility for the invention.
 


Situations where an applicant either fails to indicate why an
 invention is considered useful, or where the applicant inaccurately describes the
 utility should rarely arise. One reason for this is that applicants are required
 to disclose the best mode known to them of practicing the invention at the time
 they file their application. An applicant who omits a description of the specific
 and substantial utility of the invention, or who incompletely describes that
 utility, may encounter problems with respect to the best mode requirement of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph.
 

***B.******No Statement of Utility for the Claimed Invention in the Specification
 Does Not Per Se Negate Utility***Occasionally, an applicant will not explicitly state in the
 specification or otherwise assert a specific and substantial utility for the
 claimed invention. If no statements can be found asserting a specific and
 substantial utility for the claimed invention in the specification, Office
 personnel should determine if the claimed invention has a well-established
 utility. An invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary
 skill in the art would immediately appreciate why the invention is useful based on
 the characteristics of the invention (e.g., properties or applications of a
 product or process), and (ii) the utility is specific, substantial, and credible.
 If an invention has a well- established utility, rejections under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, based on lack of utility should
 not be imposed. *In re Folkers,* 344 F.2d 970, 145 USPQ 390 (CCPA
 1965). For example, if an application teaches the cloning and characterization of
 the nucleotide sequence of a well-known protein such as insulin, and those skilled
 in the art at the time of filing knew that insulin had a well-established use, it
 would be improper to reject the claimed invention as lacking utility solely
 because of the omitted statement of specific and substantial utility.
 


If a person of ordinary skill would not immediately recognize a
 specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention (i.e., why it would be
 useful) based on the characteristics of the invention or statements made by the
 applicant, the examiner should reject the application under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, as failing to identify a
 specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention. The rejection should
 clearly indicate that the basis of the rejection is that the application fails to
 identify a specific and substantial utility for the invention. The rejection
 should also specify that the applicant must reply by indicating why the invention
 is believed useful and where support for any subsequently asserted utility can be
 found in the specification as filed. See **[MPEP § 2701](s2701.html#d0e271945)**.
 


If the applicant subsequently indicates why the invention is
 useful, Office personnel should review that assertion according to the standards
 articulated below for review of the credibility of an asserted utility.
 

**III.** **EVALUATING THE CREDIBILITY OF AN ASSERTED UTILITY*** 

***A.******An Asserted Utility Creates a Presumption of Utility***In most cases, an applicant’s assertion of utility creates a
 presumption of utility that will be sufficient to satisfy the utility requirement
 of **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. See, e.g., *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d
 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); *In re Irons,* 340 F.2d 974, 144
 USPQ 351 (CCPA 1965); *In re Langer,* 503 F.2d 1380, 183 USPQ 288
 (CCPA 1974); *In re Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154, 1159, 196 USPQ 209,
 212-13 (CCPA 1977). As the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals stated in
 *In re Langer*:
 



> 
> As a matter of Patent Office practice, a specification which
>  contains a disclosure of utility which corresponds in scope to the subject
>  matter sought to be patented must be taken as sufficient
>  to satisfy the utility requirement of **[§ 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** for the entire
>  claimed subject matter unless there is a reason for one
>  skilled in the art to question the objective truth of the statement of utility
>  or its scope.
>  
> 
> 
> 


*In re Langer,* 503 F.2d at 1391, 183 USPQ at 297 (emphasis in
 original). The "Langer" test for utility has been used by both the Federal Circuit
 and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in evaluation of rejections under
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, where the rejection is based on a deficiency under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. In *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34
 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the Federal Circuit explicitly adopted the Court of
 Customs and Patent Appeals formulation of the "Langer" standard for
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph rejections, as it was expressed in a slightly reworded format in
 *In re Marzocchi,* 439 F.2d 220, 223, 169 USPQ 367, 369 (CCPA
 1971), namely:
 



> 
> [A] specification disclosure which contains a teaching of the
>  manner and process of making and using the invention in terms which correspond
>  in scope to those used in describing and defining the subject matter sought to
>  be patented must be taken as in compliance with the
>  enabling requirement of the first paragraph of **[§ 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**
>  unless there is reason to doubt the objective truth of the statements contained
>  therein which must be relied on for enabling support. (emphasis added).
>

> 


Thus, *Langer* and subsequent cases direct the
 Office to presume that a statement of utility made by an applicant is true. See
 *In re Langer,* 503 F.2d at 1391, 183 USPQ at 297; *In
 re Malachowski,* 530 F.2d 1402, 1404, 189 USPQ 432, 435 (CCPA 1976);
 *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995).
 For obvious reasons of efficiency and in deference to an applicant’s understanding
 of the invention, when a statement of utility is evaluated, Office personnel
 should not begin by questioning the truth of the statement of utility. Instead,
 any inquiry must start by asking if there is any reason to question the truth of
 the statement of utility. This can be done by simply evaluating the logic of the
 statements made, taking into consideration any evidence cited by the applicant. If
 the asserted utility is credible (i.e., believable based on the record or the
 nature of the invention), a rejection based on "lack of utility" is not
 appropriate. Clearly, Office personnel should not begin an evaluation of utility
 by assuming that an asserted utility is likely to be false, based on the technical
 field of the invention or for other general reasons.
 


Compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** is a question of
 fact. *Raytheon**v.**Roper,* 724 F.2d 951, 956, 220 USPQ 592, 596 (Fed. Cir. 1983)
 *cert. denied,* 469 U.S. 835 (1984). Thus, to overcome the
 presumption of truth that an assertion of utility by the applicant enjoys, Office
 personnel must establish that it is more likely than not that one of ordinary
 skill in the art would doubt (i.e., "question") the truth of the statement of
 utility. The evidentiary standard to be used throughout *ex
 parte* examination in setting forth a rejection is a preponderance of
 the totality of the evidence under consideration. *In re
 Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992)
 ("After evidence or argument is submitted by the applicant in response,
 patentability is determined on the totality of the record, by a preponderance of
 evidence with due consideration to persuasiveness of argument."); *In re
 Corkill,* 771 F.2d 1496, 1500, 226 USPQ 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1985). A
 preponderance of the evidence exists when it suggests that it is more likely than
 not that the assertion in question is true. *Herman**v.**Huddleston,* 459 U.S. 375, 390 (1983). To do this, Office
 personnel must provide evidence sufficient to show that the statement of asserted
 utility would be considered "false" by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Of
 course, a person of ordinary skill must have the benefit of both facts and
 reasoning in order to assess the truth of a statement. This means that if the
 applicant has presented facts that support the reasoning used in asserting a
 utility, Office personnel must present countervailing facts and reasoning
 sufficient to establish that a person of ordinary skill would not believe the
 applicant’s assertion of utility. *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34
 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The initial evidentiary standard used during
 evaluation of this question is a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., the totality
 of facts and reasoning suggest that it is more likely than not that the statement
 of the applicant is false). 
 

***B.******When Is an Asserted Utility Not Credible?***Where an applicant has specifically asserted that an invention
 has a particular utility, that assertion cannot simply be dismissed by Office
 personnel as being "wrong," even when there may be reason to believe that the
 assertion is not entirely accurate. Rather, Office personnel must determine if the
 assertion of utility is credible (i.e., whether the
 assertion of utility is believable to a person of ordinary skill in the art based
 on the totality of evidence and reasoning provided). An assertion is credible
 unless (A) the logic underlying the assertion is seriously flawed, or (B) the
 facts upon which the assertion is based are inconsistent with the logic underlying
 the assertion. Credibility as used in this context refers to the reliability of
 the statement based on the logic and facts that are offered by the applicant to
 support the assertion of utility.
 


One situation where an assertion of utility would not be
 considered credible is where a person of ordinary skill would consider the
 assertion to be "incredible in view of contemporary knowledge" and where nothing
 offered by the applicant would counter what contemporary knowledge might otherwise
 suggest. Office personnel should be careful, however, not to label certain types
 of inventions as "incredible" or "speculative" as such labels do not provide the
 correct focus for the evaluation of an assertion of utility. "Incredible utility"
 is a conclusion, not a starting point for analysis under **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. A conclusion that an asserted utility is incredible can
 be reached only after the Office has evaluated both the assertion of the applicant
 regarding utility and any evidentiary basis of that
 assertion. The Office should be particularly careful not to start with a
 presumption that an asserted utility is, *per se,* "incredible"
 and then proceed to base a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** on that
 presumption.
 


Rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** based on a lack
 of credible utility have been sustained by federal courts when, for example, the
 applicant failed to disclose any utility for the invention or asserted a utility
 that could only be true if it violated a scientific principle, such as the second
 law of thermodynamics, or a law of nature, or was wholly
 inconsistent with contemporary knowledge in the art. *In re
 Gazave,* 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967). Special care
 should be taken when assessing the credibility of an asserted therapeutic utility
 for a claimed invention. In such cases, a previous lack of success in treating a
 disease or condition, or the absence of a proven animal model for testing the
 effectiveness of drugs for treating a disorder in humans, should not, standing
 alone, serve as a basis for challenging the asserted utility under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. See **[MPEP § 2107.03](s2107.html#d0e200058)** for additional
 guidance with regard to therapeutic or pharmacological utilities.
 

**IV.** **INITIAL BURDEN IS ON THE OFFICE TO ESTABLISH A *PRIMA FACIE*
 CASE AND PROVIDE EVIDENTIARY SUPPORT THEREOF**To properly reject a claimed invention under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**,
 the Office must (A) make a *prima facie* showing that the claimed
 invention lacks utility, and (B) provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for factual
 assumptions relied upon in establishing the *prima facie* showing.
 *In re Gaubert,* 524 F.2d 1222, 1224, 187 USPQ 664, 666 (CCPA
 1975) "Accordingly, the PTO must do more than merely question operability - it must
 set forth factual reasons which would lead one skilled in the art to question the
 objective truth of  the statement of operability." If the Office cannot develop a
 proper *prima facie* case and provide evidentiary support for a
 rejection under **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, a rejection on this ground should not be imposed.
 See, e.g., *In re Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443,
 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("[T]he examiner bears the initial burden, on review of the
 prior art or on any other ground, of presenting a *prima facie* case
 of unpatentability. If that burden is met, the burden of coming forward with evidence
 or argument shifts to the applicant.... If examination at the initial stage does not
 produce a *prima facie* case of unpatentability, then without more
 the applicant is entitled to grant of the patent."). See also
 *Fregeau**v.**Mossinghoff,* 776 F.2d 1034, 227 USPQ 848 (Fed. Cir. 1985)
 (applying *prima facie* case law to **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**);
 *In re Piasecki,* 745 F.2d 1468, 223 USPQ 785 (Fed. Cir. 1984). 
 


The *prima facie* showing must be set forth in a
 well-reasoned statement. Any rejection based on lack of utility should include a
 detailed explanation why the claimed invention has no specific and substantial
 credible utility. Whenever possible, the examiner should provide documentary evidence
 regardless of publication date (e.g., scientific or technical journals, excerpts from
 treatises or books, or U.S. or foreign patents) to support the factual basis for the
 *prima facie* showing of no specific and substantial credible
 utility. If documentary evidence is not available, the examiner should specifically
 explain the scientific basis for the examiner's factual conclusions.
 


 Where the asserted utility is not specific or substantial, a
 *prima facie* showing must establish that it is more likely than
 not that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not consider that any utility
 asserted by the applicant would be specific and substantial. The *prima
 facie* showing must contain the following elements:
 


* (A) An explanation that clearly sets forth the reasoning used in
 concluding that the asserted utility for the claimed invention is neither both
 specific and substantial nor well-established;
* (B) Support for factual findings relied upon in reaching this
 conclusion; and
* (C) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of record, including
 utilities taught in the closest prior art.


Where the asserted specific and substantial utility is not credible,
 a *prima facie* showing of no specific and substantial credible
 utility must establish that it is more likely than not that a person skilled in the
 art would not consider credible any specific and substantial utility asserted by the
 applicant for the claimed invention. The *prima facie* showing must
 contain the following elements:
 


* (A) An explanation that clearly sets forth the reasoning used in
 concluding that the asserted specific and substantial utility is not
 credible;
* (B) Support for factual findings relied upon in reaching this
 conclusion; and
* (C) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of record, including
 utilities taught in the closest prior art.


Where no specific and substantial utility is disclosed or is
 well-established, a *prima facie* showing of no specific and
 substantial utility need only establish that applicant has not asserted a utility and
 that, on the record before the examiner, there is no known well-established
 utility.
 


It is imperative that Office personnel use specificity in setting
 forth and initial rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** and support any
 factual conclusions made in the *prima facie* showing. 
 


By using specificity, the applicant will be able to identify the
 assumptions made by the Office in setting forth the rejection and will be able to
 address those assumptions properly.
 


Use form paragraphs **[7.04.01](#fp7.04.01)** and
 **[7.05.02](#fp7.05.02)**
 through **[7.05.04](#fp.7.05.04)** to reject claims under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 for failure to satisfy the utility requirement.
 


# ¶ 7.05.02 Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Utility Lacking


the claimed invention lacks patentable utility. **[1]**


### Examiner Note:


In bracket 1, provide explanation of lack of utility. See
 **[MPEP §§ 2105](s2105.html#d0e197008)** - **[2107.03](s2107.html#d0e200058)**.
 



# ¶ 7.05.03 Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Inoperative


the disclosed invention is inoperative and therefore lacks utility. **[1]**


### Examiner Note:


In bracket 1, explain why invention is inoperative.



# ¶ 7.05.04 Utility Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. 101 and 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or 35
 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA), First Paragraph


Claim **[1]** rejected under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** because the claimed invention is not supported by either a
 **[2]** asserted utility or a well established utility.
 


**[3]**


Claim **[4]** also rejected
 under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph.
 Specifically, because the claimed invention is not supported by either a **[5]**
 asserted utility or a well established utility for the reasons set forth above, one skilled in
 the art clearly would not know how to use the claimed invention.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. Where the specification would not enable one skilled in the art to
 make the claimed invention, or where alternative reasons support the enablement
 rejection, a separate rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first paragraph, enablement should be made using the factors
 set forth in *In re Wands*, 858 F.2d 731, 8 USPQ2d 1400 (Fed. Cir.
 1988) and an undue experimentation analysis. See **[MPEP §§ 2164](s2164.html#d0e215224)** - **[2164.08(c)](s2164.html#d0e216899)**.
* 2. Use Format A, B, or C below as
 appropriate.
	+ Format A:- (a) Insert the same claim numbers in
		 brackets 1 and 4.
		- (b) Insert --specific and substantial--
		 in inserts 2 and 5.
		- (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation
		 as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a specific and
		 substantial asserted utility or a well established
		 utility.
		- (d) Format A is to be used when there is
		 no asserted utility and when there is an asserted utility but that
		 utility is not specific and substantial.
	+ Format B:- (a) Insert the same claim numbers in
		 brackets 1 and 4.
		- (b) Insert --credible-- in inserts 2 and
		 5.
		- (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation
		 as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a credible
		 asserted utility or a well established utility.
	+ Format C:- For claims that have multiple utilities, some of which
		 are not specific and substantial, some of which are not credible, but none of
		 which are specific, substantial and credible:
			* (a) Insert the same claim numbers in brackets 1 and
			 4.
			* (b) Insert --specific and substantial asserted
			 utility, a credible-- in inserts 2 and 5.
			* (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation as to why the
			 claimed invention is not supported by either a specific and substantial
			 asserted utility, a credible asserted utility or a well established
			 utility. Each utility should be addressed.


**V.** **EVIDENTIARY REQUESTS BY AN EXAMINER TO SUPPORT AN ASSERTED UTILITY**In appropriate situations the Office may require an applicant to
 substantiate an asserted utility for a claimed invention. See *In re
 Pottier,* 376 F.2d 328, 330, 153 USPQ 407, 408 (CCPA 1967) ("When the
 operativeness of any process would be deemed unlikely by one of ordinary skill in the
 art, it is not improper for the examiner to call for evidence of operativeness.").
 See also *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 1327, 206 USPQ 885, 890
 (CCPA 1980); *In re Citron,* 325 F.2d 248, 139 USPQ 516 (CCPA 1963);
  *In re Novak,* 306 F.2d 924, 928, 134 USPQ 335, 337 (CCPA1962).
 In *In re Citron,* the court held that when an "alleged utility
 appears to be incredible in the light of the knowledge of the art, or factually
 misleading, applicant must establish the asserted utility by acceptable proof." 325
 F.2d at 253, 139 USPQ at 520. The court approved of the board’s decision which
 affirmed the rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** "in view
 of the art knowledge of the lack of a cure for cancer and the absence of any
 clinical data to substantiate the allegation." 325 F.2d at 252, 139
 USPQ at 519 (emphasis in original). The court thus established a higher burden on the
 applicant where the statement of use is incredible or misleading. In such a case, the
 examiner should challenge the use and require sufficient evidence of operativeness.
 The purpose of this authority is to enable an applicant to cure an otherwise
 defective factual basis for the operability of an invention. Because this is a
 curative authority (e.g., evidence is requested to enable an applicant to support an
 assertion that is inconsistent with the facts of record in the application), Office
 personnel should indicate not only why the factual record is defective in relation to
 the assertions of the applicant, but also, where appropriate, what type of
 evidentiary showing can be provided by the applicant to remedy the problem.
 


Requests for additional evidence should be imposed rarely, and only
 if necessary to support the scientific credibility of the asserted utility (e.g., if
 the asserted utility is not consistent with the evidence of record and current
 scientific knowledge). As the Federal Circuit recently noted, "[o]nly after the PTO
 provides evidence showing that one of ordinary skill in the art would reasonably
 doubt the asserted utility does the burden shift to the applicant to provide rebuttal
 evidence sufficient to convince such a person of the invention’s asserted utility."
 *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995)
 (citing *In re Bundy,* 642 F.2d 430, 433, 209 USPQ 48, 51 (CCPA
 1981)). In *Brana,* the court pointed out that the purpose of
 treating cancer with chemical compounds does not
 suggest, *per se,* an incredible utility. Where the prior
 art disclosed "structurally similar compounds to those claimed by applicants which
 have been proven *in vivo* to be effective as chemotherapeutic
 agents against various tumor models . . ., one skilled in the art would be without
 basis to reasonably doubt applicants’ asserted utility on its face." 51 F.3d at 1566,
 34 USPQ2d at 1441. As courts have stated, "it is clearly improper for the examiner to
 make a demand for further test data, which as evidence would be essentially redundant
 and would seem to serve for nothing except perhaps to unduly burden the applicant."
 *In re Isaacs,* 347 F.2d 887, 890, 146 USPQ 193, 196 (CCPA
 1965).
 

**VI.** **CONSIDERATION OF A REPLY TO A *PRIMA FACIE* REJECTION FOR
 LACK OF UTILITY**If a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** has been properly
 imposed, along with a corresponding rejection under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)** or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, first
 paragraph, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut the *prima
 facie* showing. *In re Oetiker,* 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24
 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("The examiner bears the initial burden, on review
 of the prior art or on any other ground, of presenting a *prima
 facie* case of unpatentability. If that burden is met, the burden of
 coming forward with evidence or argument shifts to the applicant. . . After evidence
 or argument is submitted by the applicant in response, patentability is determined on
 the totality of the record, by a preponderance of evidence with due consideration to
 persuasiveness of argument."). An applicant can do this using any combination of the
 following: amendments to the claims, arguments or reasoning, or new evidence
 submitted in an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552)**, or in a printed
 publication. New evidence provided by an applicant must be relevant to the issues
 raised in the rejection. For example, declarations in which conclusions are set forth
 without establishing a nexus between those conclusions and the supporting evidence,
 or which merely express opinions, may be of limited probative value with regard to
 rebutting a *prima facie* case. *In re Grunwell,*
 609 F.2d 486, 203 USPQ 1055 (CCPA 1979); *In re Buchner,* 929 F.2d
 660, 18 USPQ2d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1991). See **[MPEP § 716.01(a)](s716.html#d0e92557)** through
 **[MPEP
 § 716.01(c)](s716.html#d0e92659)**.
 


If the applicant responds to the *prima facie*
 rejection, Office personnel should review the original disclosure, any evidence
 relied upon in establishing the *prima facie* showing, any claim
 amendments, and any new reasoning or evidence provided by the applicant in support of
 an asserted specific and substantial credible utility. It is essential for Office
 personnel to recognize, fully consider and respond to each substantive element of any
 response to a rejection based on lack of utility. Only where the totality of the
 record continues to show that the asserted utility is not specific, substantial, and
 credible should a rejection based on lack of utility be maintained. If the record as
 a whole would make it more likely than not that the asserted utility for the claimed
 invention would be considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art, the
 Office cannot maintain the rejection. *In re Rinehart,* 531 F.2d
 1048, 1052, 189 USPQ 143, 147 (CCPA 1976).
 

**VII.** **EVALUATION OF EVIDENCE RELATED TO UTILITY**There is no predetermined amount or character of evidence that must
 be provided by an applicant to support an asserted utility, therapeutic or otherwise.
 Rather, the character and amount of evidence needed to support an asserted utility
 will vary depending on what is claimed *(Ex parte Ferguson,* 117
 USPQ 229 (Bd. App. 1957)), and whether the asserted utility appears to contravene
 established scientific principles and beliefs. *In re Gazave,* 379
 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967); *In re Chilowsky,*
 229 F.2d 457, 462, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956). Furthermore, the applicant does not
 have to provide evidence sufficient to establish that an asserted utility is true
 "beyond a reasonable doubt." *In re Irons,* 340 F.2d 974, 978, 144
 USPQ 351, 354 (CCPA 1965). Nor must an applicant provide evidence such that it
 establishes an asserted utility as a matter of statistical certainty.
 *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856-57, 206 USPQ 881, 883-84 (CCPA 1980)
 (reversing the Board and rejecting Bowler’s arguments that the evidence of utility
 was statistically insignificant. The court pointed out that a rigorous correlation is
 not necessary when the test is reasonably predictive of the response). See also
 *Rey-Bellet**v.**Englehardt,* 493 F.2d 1380, 181 USPQ 453 (CCPA 1974) (data from
 animal testing is relevant to asserted human therapeutic utility if there is a
 "satisfactory correlation between the effect on the animal and that ultimately
 observed in human beings"). Instead, evidence will be sufficient if, considered as a
 whole, it leads a person of ordinary skill in the art to conclude that the asserted
 utility is more likely than not true.

# 2107.03 Special Considerations for Asserted Therapeutic or
 Pharmacological Utilities [R-08.2012]


The federal courts have consistently reversed rejections by the Office
 asserting a lack of utility for inventions claiming a pharmacological or therapeutic
 utility where an applicant has provided evidence that reasonably supports such a
 utility. In view of this, Office personnel should be particularly careful in their
 review of evidence provided in support of an asserted therapeutic or pharmacological
 utility.
 

**I.** **A REASONABLE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE EVIDENCE AND THE ASSERTED UTILITY IS
 SUFFICIENT**As a general matter, evidence of pharmacological or other biological
 activity of a compound will be relevant to an asserted therapeutic use if there is a
 reasonable correlation between the activity in question and
 the asserted utility. *Cross**v. Iizuka,* 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985);
 *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980);
 *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 206 USPQ 881 (CCPA 1980). An applicant can
 establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically relevant data
 documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or reasoning,
 documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any combination
 thereof. The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists between a
 particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a matter of
 statistical certainty, nor does he or she have to provide actual evidence of success
 in treating humans where such a utility is asserted. Instead, as the courts have
 repeatedly held, all that is required is a reasonable correlation between the
 activity and the asserted use. *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 857, 206 USPQ 881, 884 (CCPA 1980).
 

**II.** **STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY TO COMPOUNDS WITH ESTABLISHED UTILITY**Courts have routinely found evidence of structural similarity to a
 compound known to have a particular therapeutic or pharmacological utility as being
 supportive of an assertion of therapeutic utility for a new compound. In *In
 re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980), the claimed
 compounds were found to have utility based on a finding of a close structural
 relationship to daunorubicin and doxorubicin and shared pharmacological activity with
 those compounds, both of which were known to be useful in cancer chemotherapy. The
 evidence of close structural similarity with the known compounds was presented in
 conjunction with evidence demonstrating substantial activity of the claimed
 compounds in animals customarily employed for screening anticancer agents. Such
 evidence should be given appropriate weight in determining whether one skilled in the
 art would find the asserted utility credible. Office personnel should evaluate not
 only the existence of the structural relationship, but also the reasoning used by the
 applicant or a declarant to explain why that structural similarity is believed to be
 relevant to the applicant's assertion of utility.
 

**III.** **DATA FROM *IN VITRO* OR ANIMAL TESTING IS GENERALLY
 SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THERAPEUTIC UTILITY**If reasonably correlated to the particular therapeutic or
 pharmacological utility, data generated using *in vitro* assays, or
 from testing in an animal model or a combination thereof almost invariably will be
 sufficient to establish therapeutic or pharmacological utility for a compound,
 composition or process. A cursory review of cases involving therapeutic inventions
 where **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** was the dispositive issue illustrates the fact that the
 federal courts are not particularly receptive to rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**
 based on inoperability. Most striking is the fact that in those cases where an
 applicant supplied a reasonable evidentiary showing supporting an asserted
 therapeutic utility, almost uniformly the **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**-based rejection was
 reversed. See, e.g., *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ 1436 (Fed.
 Cir. 1995); *Cross**v. Iizuka,* 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985);
 *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980);
 *Nelson**v.**Bowler,* 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980);
 *In re Malachowski,* 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1976);
 *In re Gaubert,* 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1975);
 *In re Gazave,* 379 F.2d 973, 154 USPQ 92 (CCPA 1967);
 *In re Hartop,* 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962);
 *In re Krimmel,* 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961). Only in
 those cases where the applicant was unable to come forward with any relevant evidence
 to rebut a finding by the Office that the claimed invention was inoperative was a
 **[35 U.S.C.
 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** rejection affirmed by the court. *In re
 Citron,* 325 F.2d 248, 253, 139 USPQ 516, 520 (CCPA 1963) (therapeutic
 utility for an uncharacterized biological extract not supported or scientifically
 credible); *In re Buting,* 418 F.2d 540, 543, 163 USPQ 689, 690
 (CCPA 1969) (record did not establish a credible basis for the assertion that the
 single class of compounds in question would be useful in treating disparate types of
 cancers); *In re Novak,* 306 F.2d 924, 134 USPQ 335 (CCPA 1962)
 (claimed compounds did not have capacity to effect physiological activity upon which
 utility claim based). Contrast, however, *In re Buting* to
 *In re Gardner,* 475 F.2d 1389, 177 USPQ 396 (CCPA 1973),
 *reh'g denied,* 480 F.2d 879 (CCPA 1973), in which the court held
 that utility for a genus was found to be supported through a showing of utility for
 one species. In no case has a federal court required an applicant to support an
 asserted utility with data from human clinical trials.
 


If an applicant provides data, whether from *in
 vitro* assays or animal tests or both, to support an asserted utility,
 and an explanation of why that data supports the asserted utility, the Office will
 determine if the data and the explanation would be viewed by one skilled in the art
 as being reasonably predictive of the asserted utility. See, e.g., *Ex parte
 Maas,* 9 USPQ2d 1746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987); *Ex parte
 Balzarini,* 21 USPQ2d 1892 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991). Office
 personnel must be careful to evaluate all factors that might influence the
 conclusions of a person of ordinary skill in the art as to this question, including
 the test parameters, choice of animal, relationship of the activity to the particular
 disorder to be treated, characteristics of the compound or composition, relative
 significance of the data provided and, most importantly, the explanation offered by
 the applicant as to why the information provided is believed to support the asserted
 utility. If the data supplied is consistent with the asserted utility, the Office
 cannot maintain a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**.
 


Evidence does not have to be in the form of data from an
 art-recognized animal model for the particular disease or disease condition to which
 the asserted utility relates. Data from any test that the applicant reasonably
 correlates to the asserted utility should be evaluated substantively. Thus, an
 applicant may provide data generated using a particular animal model with an
 appropriate explanation as to why that data supports the asserted utility. The
 absence of a certification that the test in question is an industry-accepted model is
 not dispositive of whether data from an animal model is in fact relevant to the
 asserted utility. Thus, if one skilled in the art would accept the animal tests as
 being reasonably predictive of utility in humans, evidence
 from those tests should be considered sufficient to support the credibility of the
 asserted utility. *In re Hartop,* 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA
 1962); *In re Krimmel,* 292 F.2d 948, 953, 130 USPQ 215, 219 (CCPA
 1961); *Ex parte Krepelka,* 231 USPQ 746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1986). Office personnel should be careful not to find evidence unpersuasive simply
 because no animal model for the human disease condition had been established prior to
 the filing of the application. See *In re Chilowsky,* 229 F.2d 457,
 461, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956) ("The mere fact that something has not previously
 been done clearly is not, in itself, a sufficient basis for rejecting all
 applications purporting to disclose how to do it."); *In re Wooddy,*
 331 F.2d 636, 639, 141 USPQ 518, 520 (CCPA 1964) ("It appears that no one on earth is
 certain as of the present whether the process claimed will operate in the manner
 claimed. Yet absolute certainty is not required by the law. The mere fact that
 something has not previously been done clearly is not, in itself, a sufficient basis
 for rejecting all applications purporting to disclose how to do it.").
 

**IV.** **HUMAN CLINICAL DATA**Office personnel should not impose on applicants the unnecessary
 burden of providing evidence from human clinical trials. There is no decisional law
 that requires an applicant to provide data from human clinical trials to establish
 utility for an invention related to treatment of human disorders (see *In re
 Isaacs,* 347 F.2d 889, 146 USPQ 193 (CCPA 1963); *In re
 Langer,* 503 F.2d 1380, 183 USPQ 288 (CCPA 1974)), even with respect to
 situations where no art-recognized animal models existed for the human disease
 encompassed by the claims. *Ex parte Balzarini,* 21 USPQ2d 1892 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1991) (human clinical data is not required to demonstrate the
 utility of the claimed invention, even though those skilled in the art might not
 accept other evidence to establish the efficacy of the claimed therapeutic
 compositions and the operativeness of the claimed methods of treating humans). Before
 a drug can enter human clinical trials, the sponsor, often the
 applicant, must provide a convincing rationale to those
 especially skilled in the art (e.g., the Food and Drug
 Administration (FDA)) that the investigation may be successful. Such a rationale
 would provide a basis for the sponsor’s expectation that the investigation may be
 successful. In order to determine a protocol for phase I testing, the first phase of
 clinical investigation, some credible rationale of how the drug might be effective or
 could be effective would be necessary. Thus, as a general rule, if an
 applicant has initiated human clinical trials for a therapeutic product or
 process, Office personnel should presume that the applicant has established that
 the subject matter of that trial is reasonably predictive of having the asserted
 therapeutic utility.

**V.** **SAFETY AND EFFICACY CONSIDERATIONS**The Office must confine its review of patent applications to the
 statutory requirements of the patent law. Other agencies of the government have been
 assigned the responsibility of ensuring conformance to standards established by
 statute for the advertisement, use, sale or distribution of drugs. The FDA pursues a
 two-prong test to provide approval for testing. Under that test, a sponsor must show
 that the investigation does not pose an unreasonable and significant risk of illness
 or injury and that there is an acceptable rationale for the study. As a review
 matter, there must be a rationale for believing that the compound could be effective.
 If the use reviewed by the FDA is not set forth in the specification, FDA review may
 not satisfy **[35
 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. However, if the reviewed use is one set forth in
 the specification, Office personnel must be extremely hesitant to challenge utility.
 In such a situation, experts at the FDA have assessed the rationale for the drug or
 research study upon which an asserted utility is based and found it satisfactory.
 Thus, in challenging utility, Office personnel must be able to carry their burden
 that there is no sound rationale for the asserted utility even though experts
 designated by Congress to decide the issue have come to an opposite conclusion. "FDA
 approval, however, is not a prerequisite for finding a compound useful within the
 meaning of the patent laws." *In re Brana,* 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d
 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citing *Scott**v.**Finney,* 34 F.3d 1058, 1063, 32 USPQ2d 1115, 1120 (Fed. Cir.
 1994)).
 


Thus, while an applicant may on occasion need to provide evidence to
 show that an invention will work as claimed, it is improper for Office personnel to
 request evidence of safety in the treatment of humans, or regarding the
 degree of effectiveness. See *In re
 Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977); *In re
 Hartop,* 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962); *In re
 Anthony,* 414 F.2d 1383, 162 USPQ 594 (CCPA 1969); *In re
 Watson,* 517 F.2d 465, 186 USPQ 11 (CCPA 1975); *In re
 Krimmel,* 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961); *Ex parte
 Jovanovics,* 211 USPQ 907 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1981).
 

**VI.** **TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISEASE CONDITIONS**Claims directed to a method of treating or curing a disease for
 which there have been no previously successful treatments or cures warrant careful
 review for compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**. The credibility of
 an asserted utility for treating a human disorder may be more difficult to establish
 where current scientific understanding suggests that such a task would be impossible.
 Such a determination has always required a good understanding of the state of the art
 as of the time that the invention was made. For example, prior to the 1980’s, there
 were a number of cases where an asserted use in treating cancer in humans was viewed
 as "incredible." *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA
 1980); *In re Buting,* 418 F.2d 540, 163 USPQ 689 (CCPA 1969);
 *Ex parte Stevens,* 16 USPQ2d 1379 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1990); *Ex parte Busse,* 1 USPQ2d 1908 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1986); *Ex parte Krepelka,* 231 USPQ 746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter.
 1986); *Ex parte Jovanovics,* 211 USPQ 907 (Bd. Pat. App. &
 Inter. 1981). The fact that there is no known cure for a disease, however, cannot
 serve as the basis for a conclusion that such an invention lacks utility. Rather,
 Office personnel must determine if the asserted utility for the invention is credible
 based on the information disclosed in the application. Only those claims for which an
 asserted utility is not credible should be rejected. In such
 cases, the Office should carefully review what is being claimed by the applicant. An
 assertion that the claimed invention is useful in treating a symptom of an incurable
 disease may be considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art on the
 basis of a fairly modest amount of evidence or support. In contrast, an assertion
 that the claimed invention will be useful in "curing" the disease may require a
 significantly greater amount of evidentiary support to be considered credible by a
 person of ordinary skill in the art. *In re Sichert,* 566 F.2d 1154,
 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977); *In re Jolles,* 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ
 885 (CCPA 1980). See also *Ex parte Ferguson,* 117 USPQ 229 (Bd.
 Pat. App. & Inter. 1957).
 


In these cases, it is important to note that the Food and Drug
 Administration has promulgated regulations that enable a party to conduct clinical
 trials for drugs used to treat life threatening and severely-debilitating illnesses,
 even where no alternative therapy exists. See 21 CFR 312.80-88 (1994). Implicit in
 these regulations is the recognition that experts qualified to evaluate the
 effectiveness of therapeutics can and often do find a sufficient basis to conduct
 clinical trials of drugs for incurable or previously untreatable illnesses. Thus,
 affidavit evidence from experts in the art indicating that there is a reasonable
 expectation of success, supported by sound reasoning, usually should be sufficient to
 establish that such a utility is credible.
