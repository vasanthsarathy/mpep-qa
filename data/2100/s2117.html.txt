# 2117 Markush Claims [R-10.2019]

**I.** **MARKUSH CLAIM**A "Markush" claim recites a list of alternatively
 useable members. *In re Harnisch,* 631 F.2d 716, 719-20 (CCPA 1980);
 *Ex parte Markush,* 1925 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 126, 127 (1924). The
 listing of specified alternatives within a Markush claim is referred to as a Markush
 group or Markush grouping. *Abbott Labs v. Baxter Pharmaceutical Products,
 Inc.,* 334 F.3d 1274, 1280-81, 67 USPQ2d 1191, 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2003)
 (citing to several sources that describe Markush groups). Claim language defined by a
 Markush grouping requires selection from a closed group "consisting of" the alternative
 members. *Id.* at 1280, 67 USPQ2d at 1196. See **[MPEP § 2111.03](s2111.html#d0e200824)**,
 subsection II, for a discussion of the term "consisting of" in the context of Markush
 groupings.
 


 Treatment of claims reciting alternatives is not
 governed by the particular format used (e.g., alternatives may be set forth as "a
 material selected from the group consisting of A, B, and C" or "wherein the material is
 A, B, or C"). See, e.g., the *Supplementary Examination Guidelines for
 Determining Compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112 and for Treatment of Related Issues in
 Patent Applications* (*"Supplementary Guidelines"*), 76
 Fed. Reg. 7162 (February 9, 2011). Claims that set forth a list of alternatives from
 which a selection is to be made are typically referred to as Markush claims, after the
 appellant in *Ex parte Markush,* 1925 Dec. Comm’r Pat. 126, 127 (1924).
 Although the term "Markush claim" is used throughout the MPEP, any claim that recites
 alternatively usable members, regardless of format, should be treated as a Markush
 claim. Inventions in metallurgy, refractories, ceramics, chemistry, pharmacology and
 biology are most frequently claimed under the Markush formula, but purely mechanical
 features or process steps may also be claimed by using the Markush style of claiming.
 See, e.g., *Fresenius USA, Inc. v. Baxter Int’l, Inc.,* 582 F.3d 1288,
 1297-98 (Fed. Cir. 2009)(claim to a hemodialysis apparatus required "at least one unit
 selected from the group consisting of (i) a dialysate-preparation unit, (ii) a
 dialysate-circulation unit, (iii) an ultrafiltrate-removal unit, and (iv) a
 dialysate-monitoring unit" and a user/machine interface operably connected thereto);
 *In re Harnisch,* 631 F.2d 716, 206 USPQ 300 (CCPA 1980)(defining
 alternative moieties of a chemical compound with Markush groupings).
 


A Markush grouping is proper if the members of a group
 share a single structural similarity and a common use. See subsections II - IV, below,
 for guidelines regarding the determination of whether a Markush grouping is
 improper.
 


See **[MPEP § 2111.03](s2111.html#d0e200824)** and
 **[MPEP §
 2173.05(h)](s2173.html#d0e218467)** for discussions of when a Markush grouping may be
 indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** (e.g., if the list
 of alternatives is not a closed grouping, or if a Markush group is so expansive that
 persons skilled in the art cannot determine the metes and bounds of the claimed
 invention). 
 


See **[MPEP § 803.02](s803.html#d0e98237)** for information
 pertaining to the election, search, and examination of claims that include at least one
 Markush grouping. 
 

**II.** **IMPROPER MARKUSH GROUPING**A Markush claim may be rejected under judicially approved
 "improper Markush grouping" principles when the claim contains an improper grouping of
 alternatively useable members. A Markush claim contains an "improper Markush grouping"
 if either: (1) the members of the Markush group do not share a "single structural
 similarity" or (2) the members do not share a common use. *Supplementary
 Guidelines* at 7166 (citing *In re Harnisch,* 631 F.2d 716,
 721-22, 206 USPQ 300, 305 (CCPA 1980)). 
 


Where a Markush grouping describes part of a combination
 or process, the members following "selected from the group consisting of" (or a similar
 introductory phrase) must be substitutable, one for the other, with the expectation that
 the same intended result would be achieved. *Multilayer Stretch Cling Film
 Holdings, Inc. v. Berry Plastics Corp.,* 831 F.3d 1350, 1357 (Fed. Cir.
 2016)("It is generally understood that … the members of the Markush group … are
 alternatively usable for the purposes of the invention … .")(citations omitted). Where a
 Markush grouping describes part of a chemical compound, regardless of whether the claim
 is limited to a compound per se or the compound is recited as part of a combination or
 process, the members following "selected from the group consisting of" (or similar
 introductory phrase) need not share a community of properties themselves; the propriety
 of the grouping is determined by a consideration of the compound as a whole. See
 *Harnisch,* 631 F.2d at 722, 206 USPQ at 305 ("in determining the
 propriety of a Markush grouping the compounds must be considered as wholes and not
 broken down into elements or other components"). See also *In re
 Jones,* 162 F.2d 479, 481 (CCPA 1947) ("In determining the propriety of a
 Markush grouping, moreover, the compounds which are grouped must each be considered as a
 whole and should not be broken down into elements or other components").
 


The alternatives defined by the Markush group are either
 alternative chemical compounds as a whole (e.g., if a claim includes a compound R-OH
 wherein R is selected from the group consisting of methyl, propyl, and butyl, then the
 alternatives are methanol, propanol, or butanol) or in the context of a combination or
 process, the alternatives from which a selection is to be made (e.g., the alternatives
 in a list following the phrase "selected from the group consisting of"). The
 alternatives (1) share a "single structural similarity" when they belong to the same
 recognized physical or chemical class or to the same art-recognized class, and (2) share
 a common function or use when they are disclosed in the specification or known in the
 art to be functionally equivalent in the context of the claimed invention. See
 *Supplementary Guidelines* at 7166 and subsection II.A, below.
 


Where a Markush grouping describes alternative chemical
 compounds, whether by words or chemical formulas, and the compounds do not appear to be
 members of a recognized physical or chemical class or members of an art-recognized
 class, the members are considered to share a "single structural similarity" and common
 use when the alternatively usable compounds share a substantial structural feature that
 is essential to a common use. *Ex parte Hozumi,* 3 USPQ2d 1059, 1060
 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1984). See also subsection II.B, below. 
 

***A.*** ***"Single Structural
 Similarity" - Members of a Physical, Chemical, or Art-Recognized
 Class***Members of a Markush group share a "single structural
 similarity" when they belong to the same recognized physical or chemical class or to
 the same art-recognized class. A recognized physical class, a recognized chemical
 class, or an art-recognized class is a class wherein there is an expectation from the
 knowledge in the art that members of the class will behave in the same way in the
 context of the claimed invention. In other words, each member could be substituted
 one for the other, with the expectation that the same intended result would be
 achieved. For example, in the context of a claim covering a disposable diaper, a
 limitation "the fastener selected from the group consisting of a pressure sensitive
 adhesive and complementary release material, a complementary hook and loop structure,
 a snap, and a buckle" would likely be considered an art recognized class because a
 review of the prior art would establish that it was well known that each member could
 be substituted for each other with the expectation that the intended result
 (repositionable and refastenable) would occur.
 


Note that where a Markush group includes only
 materials from a recognized scientific class of equivalent materials or from an
 art-recognized class, "the mere existence of such a group in an application tend[s]
 to prove the equivalence of its members and when one of them [is] anticipated the
 group [is] therefore rendered unpatentable, in the absence of some convincing
 evidence of some degree of non-equivalency of one or more of the remaining members."
 *In re Ruff,* 256 F.2d 590, 598-99, 118 USPQ 340, 348 (CCPA
 1958)("[A]ctual equivalence is not enough to justify refusal of a patent on one
 member of a group when another member is in the prior art. The equivalence must be
 disclosed in the prior art or be obvious within the terms of Section 103." Id. at
 599, 118 USPQ at 348). 
 


Thus, a Markush grouping is ordinarily proper if all
 the members of the group belong to a recognized class (whether physical, chemical, or
 art recognized) and are disclosed in the specification to possess at least one
 property in common which is mainly responsible for their function in the claimed
 invention, and it is clear from their very nature or from the prior art that all
 members possess this property. See also **[MPEP § 803.02](s803.html#d0e98237)**.
 

***B.*** ***Common Use Flows From
 Substantial Structural Feature***Where a Markush grouping describes alternative chemical
 compounds, whether by words or chemical formulas, and the alternatives do not belong to
 a recognized class as explained in subsection II.A, above, the members of the Markush
 grouping may still be considered to be proper where the alternatives share a substantial
 structural feature that is essential to a common use.
 


For example, in *Harnisch*, the claims
 were directed to a Markush group of coumarin derivatives disclosed to be useful as dyes.
 The claimed coumarin derivatives were not members of a recognized chemical class,
 encompassing "polyfused N-heterocyclics, cyclic, acyclic and aromatic amines,
 aryloxyalkylamines, amides, sulfonamides, [and] phthalimides" among others.
 *Harnisch,* 631 F.2d at 718, 206 USPQ at 302. Furthermore, they were
 not members of an art-recognized class ("[n]owhere in the record has it been established
 or even alleged that the variety of compounds included within the explicit scope of the
 claims are recognized by the art as being functionally equivalent"
 (*Id.*)). However, the court found that the Markush grouping was
 proper because the claimed compounds, viewed as a whole, all share a coumarin group and
 the property of being a dye. See also *In re Jones,* 162 F.2d 479, 481
 (1947).
 


See also *Ex parte Hozumi*, 3 USPQ2d
 1059, 1060 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1984)). See subsection IV, below, for a discussion
 of the *Harnisch* and *Hozumi* decisions.
 

**III.** **REJECTION BASED ON IMPROPER MARKUSH
 GROUPING**When an examiner determines that the species of a
 Markush group do not share a single structural similarity or do not share a common
 use, then a rejection on the basis that the claim contains an ‘‘improper Markush
 grouping’’ is appropriate (see subsection II). Note that this is a rejection on the
 merits and may be appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in accordance with
 **[35 U.S.C.
 134](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303218912313)** and **[37 CFR 41.31(a)(1)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d24d1f_19b20_1b6)**. Use Form
 Paragraph **[8.40](#fp8.40)** to reject a claim on the basis that it includes
 an improper Markush grouping.
 


# ¶ 8.40 Improper Markush Grouping Rejection


Claim **[1]** rejected on the basis that it contains an
 improper Markush grouping of alternatives. See *In re Harnisch,* 631 F.2d
 716, 721-22 (CCPA 1980) and *Ex parte Hozumi,* 3 USPQ2d 1059, 1060 (Bd. Pat.
 App. & Int. 1984). A Markush grouping is proper if the alternatives defined by the Markush
 group (i.e., alternatives from which a selection is to be made in the context of a combination
 or process, or alternative chemical compounds as a whole) share a "single structural
 similarity" and a common use. A Markush grouping meets these requirements in two situations.
 First, a Markush grouping is proper if the alternatives are all members of the same recognized
 physical or chemical class or the same art-recognized class, and are disclosed in the
 specification or known in the art to be functionally equivalent and have a common use. Second,
 where a Markush grouping describes alternative chemical compounds, whether by words or
 chemical formulas, and the alternatives do not belong to a recognized class as set forth
 above, the members of the Markush grouping may be considered to share a "single structural
 similarity" and common use where the alternatives share both a substantial structural feature
 and a common use that flows from the substantial structural feature. See **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)**.
 


The Markush grouping of **[2]** is improper because the alternatives defined by the
 Markush grouping do not share both a single structural similarity and a common use for the
 following reasons: **[3]**. 
 


To overcome this rejection, Applicant may set forth each alternative (or grouping of
 patentably indistinct alternatives) within an improper Markush grouping in a series of
 independent or dependent claims and/or present convincing arguments that the group members
 recited in the alternative within a single claim in fact share a single structural similarity
 as well as a common use.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * 1. In bracket 1, insert claim number(s) and "is" or "are" as appropriate.
* 2. In bracket 2, insert a description of the Markush group(s) that
 are improper.
* 3. In bracket 3, explain why these alternatives do not meet the
 requirements for a proper Markush grouping, i.e., why the alternatives are not all
 members of the same recognized physical or chemical class or the same art-recognized
 class; and/or why the members are not considered to be functionally equivalent and have
 a common use; and/or why (if the Markush grouping describes alternative chemical
 compounds), the alternatives do not share both a substantial structural feature and a
 common use that flows from the substantial structural feature. See **[MPEP §
 2117](s2117.html#ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380)**.
* 4. If an election of species requirement is appropriate, this form
 paragraph should only be used after applicant has made an election.



In accordance with the principles of compact
 prosecution, a rejection based on an improper Markush grouping should be made in the
 first action on the merits after presentation of the claim with the improper Markush
 grouping (e.g., first Office action on the merits or next Office action following
 presentation of the claim). In addition, if the examiner determines that one or more
 claims include an improper Markush grouping, the examiner should also require the
 applicant to elect an alternative or group of indistinct alternatives for search and
 examination (i.e., an election of species), if such an election requirement was not
 previously made. See **[MPEP § 803.02](s803.html#d0e98237)** for more information on election of species
 requirements in Markush claims. Note that if a written provisional election of
 species requirement must be made separate from the first Office action on the merits,
 it should not include a rejection on the basis of an improper Markush grouping. Any
 appropriate improper Markush grouping rejection should be made in an Office action on
 the merits. 
 


The examiner should include suggestions for the
 applicant as to how to overcome the rejection, e.g., by suggesting a proper Markush
 grouping based on the specification as filed and/or by suggesting that applicant set
 forth each alternative (or grouping of patentably indistinct alternatives) within an
 improper Markush grouping in a series of independent or dependent claims. There may
 be more than one way to formulate a proper Markush grouping. The examiner should not
 suggest any grouping that clearly would not meet the requirements of
 **[35
 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. For example, the examiner should not suggest a
 grouping that meets the requirements for a proper Markush grouping, but would clearly
 lack adequate written description if presented in a separate claim.
 


In addition to a rejection based on an improper
 Markush grouping, the claim should also be rejected under **[35 U.S.C.
 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** if one skilled in the art cannot determine the metes and
 bounds of the Markush claim due to an inability to envision all of the members of the
 Markush grouping. In other words, if a boundary cannot be drawn separating
 embodiments encompassed by the claim from those that are not, the claim is indefinite
 and should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. See also
 **[MPEP §
 2173.05(h)](s2173.html#d0e218467)**. 
 


The claim should be examined for patentability with
 respect to all other conditions of patentability (e.g., **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**,
 **[102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**, **[112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824912)**, and
 nonstatutory double patenting). As explained with regard to election of species
 practice as set forth in detail in **[MPEP § 803.02](s803.html#d0e98237)**, the search need not
 be extended to species that fall outside a proper Markush grouping.
 


The improper Markush grouping rejection of the claim
 should be maintained until (1) the claim is amended such that the Markush grouping
 includes only members that share a single structural similarity and a common use; or
 (2) the applicant presents convincing arguments why the members of the Markush
 grouping share a single structural similarity and common use (i.e., are members of a
 physical, chemical, or art-recognized class that share a common use, or are chemical
 compounds that share a substantial structural feature that is essential to the common
 use). In addition, even if the applicant does not take action sufficient to overcome
 the improper Markush grouping rejection, when all of the claims are otherwise in
 condition for allowance the examiner should reconsider the propriety of the improper
 Markush grouping rejection. If the examiner determines that in light of the prior art
 and the record as a whole the alternatives of the Markush grouping share a single
 structural similarity and a common use, then the rejection should be withdrawn. Note
 that no Markush claim can be allowed until any improper Markush grouping rejection
 has been overcome or withdrawn, and all other conditions of patentability have been
 satisfied.
 

**IV.** **MARKUSH GROUPING EXAMPLES** The propriety of Markush groupings must be decided on
 a case-by-case basis. The following examples illustrate Markush groupings that have
 been found to be proper and improper. Office personnel should note that the cases
 from which these examples are drawn have been selected for their treatment of Markush
 groupings. The cases may not necessarily reflect current practice as to other issues
 discussed therein.

*Background:* The Board had
 entered a rejection – later reversed by the CCPA – of claim 1 under 37 CFR
 1.196(b) on the ground that it was drawn to an improper Markush group. The Board
 had focused on the wide variety of functional groups that could be present in the
 claimed compounds, and had stressed the different physical and chemical properties
 of the compounds in view of the functional groups. The Board had observed that
 "[n]owhere in the record has it been established or even alleged that the variety
 of compounds included within the explicit scope of the claims are recognized by
 the art as being functionally equivalent." In the Board’s view, "the mere fact"
 that all of the compounds encompassed by claim 1 shared "a single structural
 similarity (i.e., the coumarin group)," and as a result were useful either as dyes
 or intermediates for the preparation of dyes, was insufficient to render the
 Markush grouping proper because the compounds could "be subject to different modes
 of application and use." 
 


*Analysis/Conclusion:* The CCPA
 reversed the Board’s decision and held that the Markush grouping was proper. The
 court pointed out that all of the claimed compounds are dyes, even if some might
 also be seen as synthetic intermediates. The court noted the Board’s admission,
 despite the significant variation in functional groups, that all of the compounds
 shared "a single structural similarity" which is the coumarin core. The court held
 that "the claimed compounds all belong to a subgenus, as defined by appellant [in
 the specification], which is not repugnant to scientific classification." Stating
 that "[u]nder these circumstances we consider the claimed compounds to be part of
 a single invention," the court concluded that the Markush grouping of claim 1 was
 proper. The CCPA also stressed that they decide cases involving the propriety of
 Markush groupings "on their facts on a case-by-case basis." 
 


The *Harnisch* court also cited
 its earlier decision in *In re Jones*, 162 F.2d 479 (CCPA 1947)
 with approval as to the proper approach to evaluating claims containing Markush
 groups. According to the *Harnisch* court, "in determining the
 propriety of a Markush grouping the compounds must be considered as wholes and not
 broken down into elements or other components." In other words, when considering
 whether the members of a Markush group have sufficient structural similarity and
 common use to meet prongs 1 and 2 above, the proper focus should be on the
 commonality across all of the alternative embodiments of the invention within the
 scope of the claim. Note that in the *Harnisch* decision, the
 court looked to the common structure of the coumarin core and its associated
 common function as a dye, even though the coumarin core was not part of the
 variable Markush groups of substituents. A Markush grouping is not improper simply
 because the members of a list of alternative elements or substituents of the
 invention, as distinguished from a list of complete embodiments of the invention,
 lack "a single structural similarity" or a common use. When assessing whether a
 Markush grouping defining a chemical compound is proper, each claimed chemical
 compound as a whole must be compared and analyzed to determine whether the claimed
 compounds share both a substantial single structural similarity and a common use.

 6,201,122****Representative Claims:*



1. A fluoroaliphatic radical-containing anionic
 sulfonamido compound which comprises a fluoroaliphatic radical-containing
 sulfonamido group and an ethylenecarbonyl group whose beta ethylene carbon atom
 is bonded to a sulfur or nitrogen atom which is bonded to a linking group
 bonded to the nitrogen atom of said sulfonamido group, and the carbonyl carbon
 atom of said carbonyl is bonded to an anionic hydrophilic polar group
 comprising at least one carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom. 
 


2. The fluoroaliphatic radical-containing
 sulfonamido compound of claim 1 wherein said compound has the formula
 



> 
> * RfSO2N(R)WACH(R')CH(R'')C(O)-Y
> 
> 
> 


where Rf is a
 fluoroaliphatic radical; A is S or NR'''; W is siloxylene, silylene, alkylene,
 arylene, or combinations thereof; R, R', R'', and R''' are independently
 hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl, or combinations thereof, and can contain
 functional groups, or R and R''' together with the nitrogen atoms to which they
 are bonded and W, form a ring; and Y is an anionic hydrophilic polar group
 comprising at least one carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom. 
 




6. The fluoroaliphatic radical-containing
 sulfonamido compound of claim 2 wherein said N(R)WA is selected from the group
 consisting of N(R)CH2CH2NH,
 


![graphic representation of  cyclic alternative](graphics/Dams_N-N_figure.png)
N(R)CH2CH2CH2Si(CH3)2OSi(CH3)2CH2CH2CH2NH,
 N(R)CH(CH3)CH2(CH2CH2O)q(CH(CH3)CH2O)zCH2CH(CH3)NH
 where q and z are from 1 to 20, and
 N(R)CH2CH2S, where R is H,
 CH3 or
 CH2CH3.
 



*Background:* The examiner had
 rejected the claims on a number of grounds, including the ground of improper
 Markush groupings. It had been the examiner’s position that the Markush groups of
 the claims lacked a common structural feature. The examiner had also stated that
 in his view, the members of the Markush group were separately classifiable and
 separately patentable. This rejection was later reversed by the Board. 
 


*Analysis/Conclusion:* The Board
 stated that the examiner erred by failing to treat the compounds of the claims as
 a whole. The examiner had improperly "focused on the individual moiety defined by
 the Markush terminology." Referring to claim 6 and relying on *In re
 Harnisch*, the Board explained that even though Markush terminology
 was used to define the substituent N(R)WA, the proper inquiry was "whether the
 compounds defined by the different moieties" have the necessary common structure
 and common use. The Board held that the compounds shared "a common structural
 feature disclosed as essential to the disclosed utility of being an anionic
 surfactant." Thus the compounds satisfied prongs 1 and 2 above, and the Markush
 grouping was proper.

*Background:* The examiner had
 rejected claim 1 on the ground that it included an improper Markush grouping. 
 


*Analysis/Conclusion:* The Board
 reversed the examiner’s improper Markush grouping rejection of claim 1, once again
 relying on the *Harnisch* decision. The Board summarized
 *Harnisch* by stating that the Markush grouping of coumarin
 compounds in that case was proper because there was "in common a functional
 utility related to a substantial structural feature disclosed as being essential
 to that utility." In this case, as in others already discussed, the Board
 emphasized the case-by-case nature of the inquiry. 
 


Applying the *Harnisch* criteria
 to the facts of this case, the Board pointed out that structurally "the compounds
 claimed are phosphoric acid diesters in which one esterifying moiety is derived
 from a poly(ethylene glycol) monoether and the other is derived from a
 beta-aminoethanol." The Board acknowledged that as a result of the variable number
 of repeating oxyethylene units indicated by the "n" index, the molecular weight
 could "vary over a fairly broad range," and that further structural variation was
 seen in the etherifying groups and the substituents on the nitrogen atom. Despite
 the breadth of the claim, the Board focused on "the relatively large proportion of
 the structure of the compounds in the claimed class which is common to the entire
 class," and determined that the prong 1 requirement for structural similarity was
 met. As for the prong 2 common use requirement, the Board stated that all of the
 compounds shared antimycotic activity. Thus the Board found that in this case, as
 was also the case in *Harnisch*, there was "a substantial
 structural feature of the class of compounds claimed disclosed as being essential
 to at least one disclosed utility." Thus the Markush grouping was proper and the
 examiner’s rejection was reversed. 
 

***D.*** ***Based On PCT Search and
 Examination Guidelines Example 23***Claim 1: A herbicidal composition consisting
 essentially of an effective amount of the mixture of (a) 2,4-D
 (2,4-dichloro-phenoxy acetic acid) and (b) a second herbicide selected from the
 group consisting of copper sulfate, sodium chlorate, ammonium sulfamate, sodium
 trichloroacetate, dichloropropionic acid, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid,
 diphenamid (an amide), ioxynil (nitrile), dinoseb (phenol), trifluralin
 (dinitroaniline), EPTC (thiocarbamate), and simazine (triazine) along with an
 inert carrier or diluent.
 


*Background/Prior Art:* A review
 of the art demonstrates that the alternatives are not all members of the same
 recognized physical or chemical recognized class of compounds. The prior art
 explains that mixing herbicides can be risky and can result in physical or
 chemical incompatibilities, e.g., increasing or decreasing the effectiveness of
 each or all of the herbicides, increasing toxicity, or reacting to form a
 precipitate. The prior art also shows that the many of the herbicides set forth in
 component (b) are effective against one type of weed (e.g., algae, woody weeds, or
 grasses), but are not effective against other types of weeds. In addition, many of
 the herbicides listed in the Markush group are tolerated by one type of crop
 (e.g., legumes, tomato, or corn) or in one type of environment (e.g., ponds, golf
 courses, or orchards), but are not tolerated by other crops or in other
 environments. 
 


*Analysis:* All members of the
 Markush grouping have a common disclosed use as herbicides. However, the
 alternatives set forth in the Markush grouping are not all members of the same
 physical or chemical recognized class of compounds. Furthermore, the members of
 the Markush group defining component (b) are not in an art recognized class
 because a person of ordinary skill in the art would not expect that members of the
 class will behave in the same way in the context of the claimed invention.
 Specifically, a person of ordinary skill in the art would not expect that any one
 herbicide of component (b) could be substituted with any other member of the
 Markush group with the expectation that the same intended result would be achieved
 because of the unpredictability of results when mixing herbicides, the different
 weeds that are controlled by one member of the Markush group as compared to
 another, the different crops that do (or do not) tolerate the alternatives within
 the Markush group, and the different environments in which the each second
 herbicide is suitable for use.
 


Although the members of the Markush grouping are
 not members of a recognized class (physical, chemical, or art-recognized) for the
 reasons set forth above, the Markush grouping describes alternative chemical
 compounds. Therefore the members of the Markush grouping may be considered to
 share a "single structural similarity" and common use if the alternatives share
 both a substantial structural feature and a common use that flows from the
 substantial structural feature.
 


In this case, the members of the Markush grouping
 do not share a substantial structural feature. Rather, the members of the Markush
 group defining component (b) represent a plurality of chemical classes with
 varying structures which may be identified as follows:
 


* (a) inorganic salts: copper sulfate, sodium
 chlorate, ammonium sulfamate (no ring structure)
* (b) organic salts and carboxylic acids: sodium
 trichloroacetate, dichloropropionic acid, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid
 (only the third chemical has a ring structure, which is a benzoic acid)
* (c) amides: diphenamid (ring structure is
 diphenyl)
* (d) nitriles: ioxynil (ring structure is
 dinitrophenol)
* (e) phenols: dinoseb
* (f) amines: trifluralin, (ring structure is
 dinitroaniline), and
* (g) heterocyclic: simazine (ring structure is
 triazine).


*Conclusion:* The claim sets forth
 an improper Markush grouping because the alternatives are not all members of the
 same recognized physical or chemical class or the same art-recognized class, nor
 do the alternative chemical compounds share both a substantial structural feature
 and a common use that flows from the substantial structural feature.
