 applicable to applications and patents not subject to the first inventor to file
 provisions of the AIA.]*


* (a) NOVELTY; PRIOR ART.—A person shall be entitled to a patent unless—
	+ (1) the claimed invention was patented, described
	 in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available
	 to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention; or
	+ (2) the claimed invention was described in a
	 patent issued under **[section 151](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303440)**, or in an
	 application for patent published or deemed published under **[section
	 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303063)**, in which the patent or application, as the
	 case may be, names another inventor and was effectively filed before the
	 effective filing date of the claimed invention.
* (b) EXCEPTIONS.—
	+ (1) DISCLOSURES MADE 1 YEAR OR LESS BEFORE THE
	 EFFECTIVE FILING DATE OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION.—A disclosure made 1 year or
	 less before the effective filing date of a claimed invention shall not be
	 prior art to the claimed invention under subsection (a)(1) if—
		- (A) the disclosure was made by the inventor or
		 joint inventor or by another who obtained the subject matter disclosed
		 directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor; or
		- (B) the subject matter disclosed had, before
		 such disclosure, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint
		 inventor or another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly
		 or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.
	+ (2) DISCLOSURES APPEARING IN APPLICATIONS AND
	 PATENTS.—A disclosure shall not be prior art to a claimed invention under
	 subsection (a)(2) if—

		 obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor;
		- (B) the subject matter disclosed had, before
		 such subject matter was effectively filed under subsection
		 **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, been
		 publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who
		 obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the
		 inventor or a joint inventor; or
		- (C) the subject matter disclosed and the
		 claimed invention, not later than the effective filing date of the
		 claimed invention, were owned by the same person or subject to an
		 obligation of assignment to the same person.
* (c) COMMON OWNERSHIP UNDER JOINT RESEARCH
 AGREEMENTS.—Subject matter disclosed and a claimed invention shall be deemed to
 have been owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to
 the same person in applying the provisions of subsection (b)(2)(C) if—
	+ (1) the subject matter disclosed was developed and
	 the claimed invention was made by, or on behalf of, 1 or more parties to a
	 joint research agreement that was in effect on or before the effective
	 filing date of the claimed invention;
	+ (2) the claimed invention was made as a result of
	 activities undertaken within the scope of the joint research agreement; and
	+ (3) the application for patent for the claimed
	 invention discloses or is amended to disclose the names of the parties to
	 the joint research agreement.
* (d) PATENTS AND PUBLISHED APPLICATIONS EFFECTIVE AS
 PRIOR ART.—For purposes of determining whether a patent or application for patent
 is prior art to a claimed invention under subsection **[(a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, such patent or application shall be considered to
 have been effectively filed, with respect to any subject matter described in the
 patent or application—
	+ (1) if paragraph (2) does not apply, as of
	 the actual filing date of the patent or the application for patent; or
	+ (2) if the patent or application for patent
	 is entitled to claim a right of priority under **[section
	 119](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302921)**, **[365(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307039)**,

	 **[386(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a74_1f8)**, or to claim the
	 benefit of an earlier filing date under **[section
	 120](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303023313)**, **[121](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040912)**, **[365(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)** based upon 1 or
	 more prior filed applications for patent, as of the filing date of the
	 earliest such application that describes the subject matter.




#### *35 U.S.C. 102 (pre-AIA)  
 Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of
 right to patent.*


*[Editor Note: With the exception of subsection (g) in limited circumstances,
 not applicable to any patent application subject to the first inventor to file
 provisions of the AIA (see **[35 U.S.C. 100 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**). For an
 application or patent subject to the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA,
 see **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**.]*


A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —


* (a) the invention was known or used by others in this
 country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign
 country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, or
* (b) the invention was patented or described in a printed
 publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this
 country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the
 United States, or
* (c) he has abandoned the invention, or
* (d) the invention was first patented or caused to be patented, or was
 the subject of an inventor’s certificate, by the applicant or his legal
 representatives or assigns in a foreign country prior to the date of the
 application for patent in this country on an application for patent or inventor’s
 certificate filed more than twelve months before the filing of the application in
 the United States, or
* (e) the invention was described in — (1) an application for patent,
 published under **[section 122(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054)**, by another filed in the United States
 before the invention by the applicant for patent or (2) a patent granted on an
 application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention
 by the applicant for patent, except that an international application filed under
 the treaty defined in **[section 351(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306867)** shall have the
 effects for the purposes of this subsection of an application filed in the United
 States only if the international application designated the United States and was
 published under **[Article 21(2)](mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e363622)** of such treaty in the English language;
 or
* (f) he did not himself invent the subject matter sought to be
 patented, or
* (g)(1) during the course of an interference conducted under
 **[section
 135](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303239)** or **[section 291](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306203)**, another inventor
 involved therein establishes, to the extent permitted in **[section 104](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302559)**,
 that before such person’s invention thereof the invention was made by such other
 inventor and not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed, or (2) before such person’s
 invention thereof, the invention was made in this country by another inventor who
 had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it. In determining priority of
 invention under this subsection, there shall be considered not only the respective
 dates of conception and reduction to practice of the invention, but also the
 reasonable diligence of one who was first to conceive and last to reduce to
 practice, from a time prior to conception by the other.




#### *35 U.S.C. 103  
 Conditions for patentability; non-obvious
 subject matter.*


*[Editor Note: Applicable to any patent application subject to the first
 inventor to file provisions of the AIA (see **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**). See **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** for the law
 applicable to applications and patents not subject to the first inventor to file
 provisions of the AIA.]*


A patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained,
 notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in
 **[section
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**, if the differences between the claimed invention and the
 prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before
 the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in
 the art to which the claimed invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by
 the manner in which the invention was made.
 




#### *35 U.S.C. 103 (pre-AIA)   
 Conditions for patentability; non-obvious subject
 matter.*


*[Editor Note: **Not applicable** to any patent application subject to
 the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA (see **[35 U.S.C. 100
 (note)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d917_1bef1_2b)**). For an application or patent subject to the first
 inventor to file provisions of the AIA, see **[35 U.S.C.
 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)**.]*


* (a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not
 identically disclosed or described as set forth in **[section 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**,
 if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior
 art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the
 time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which
 said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner
 in which the invention was made.
* (b)
	+ (1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), and upon timely election by
	 the applicant for patent to proceed under this subsection, a
	 biotechnological process using or resulting in a composition of matter that
	 is novel under **[section 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
	 nonobvious under subsection (a) of this section shall be considered
	 nonobvious if-
		- (A) claims to the process and the composition of matter
		 are contained in either the same application for patent or in separate
		 applications having the same effective filing date; and
		- (B) the composition of matter, and the process at the time
		 it was invented, were owned by the same person or subject to an
		 obligation of assignment to the same person.
	+ (2) A patent issued on a process under paragraph (1)-
		- (A) shall also contain the claims to the composition of
		 matter used in or made by that process, or
		- (B) shall, if such composition of matter is claimed in
		 another patent, be set to expire on the same date as such other
		 patent, notwithstanding **[section 154](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303482)**.
	+ (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "biotechnological
	 process" means-
		- (A) a process of genetically altering or otherwise
		 inducing a single- or multi-celled organism to-
			* (i) express an exogenous nucleotide sequence,
			* (ii) inhibit, eliminate, augment, or alter expression
			 of an endogenous nucleotide sequence, or
			* (iii) express a specific physiological characteristic
			 not naturally associated with said organism;
		- (B) cell fusion procedures yielding a cell line that
		 expresses a specific protein, such as a monoclonal antibody; and
		- (C) a method of using a product produced by a process
		 defined by subparagraph (A) or (B), or a combination of subparagraphs
		 (A) and (B).
* (c)
	+ (1) Subject matter developed by another person, which qualifies
	 as prior art only under one or more of subsections (e), (f), and (g) of
	 **[section
	 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, shall not preclude patentability under this
	 section where the subject matter and the claimed invention were, at the time
	 the claimed invention was made, owned by the same person or subject to an
	 obligation of assignment to the same person.
	+ (2) For purposes of this subsection, subject matter developed by
	 another person and a claimed invention shall be deemed to have been owned by
	 the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person
	 if —
		- (A) the claimed invention was made by or on behalf of
		 parties to a joint research agreement that was in effect on or before
		 the date the claimed invention was made;
		- (B) the claimed invention was made as a result of
		 activities undertaken within the scope of the joint research
		 agreement; and
		- (C) the application for patent for the claimed invention
		 discloses or is amended to disclose the names of the parties to the
		 joint research agreement.
	+ (3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term "joint research
	 agreement" means a written contract, grant, or cooperative agreement entered
	 into by two or more persons or entities for the performance of experimental,
	 developmental, or research work in the field of the claimed invention.


**I.** **CHOICE OF PRIOR ART; BEST AVAILABLE**Prior art rejections should ordinarily be confined strictly to the best
 available art. Exceptions may properly be made, for example, where:
 


* (A) the propriety of a **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** or
 **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0)** rejection depends on a particular interpretation of a
 claim;
* (B) a claim is met by a prior art disclosure which does not disclose
 the inventive concept involved;
* (C) for cases examined under the first inventor to file provisions of
 the AIA, the most pertinent disclosure could be shown not to be prior art by
 invoking an exception in a **[37 CFR 1.130](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323465)** affidavit or
 declaration or could be antedated by a **[37 CFR 1.131](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323504)** affidavit or
 declaration, depending on the applicable version of **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52)**; or
* (D) for cases examined under pre-AIA law, an
 obviousness rejection is based on prior art that qualifies only under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 102(e), (f), or (g)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302407)** so that the rejection could be
 overcome by establishing that the prior art is disqualified under
 **[pre-AIA 35
 U.S.C. 103(c)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302521)**.


In the interest of compact prosecution, such rejections should be backed
 up by the best other art rejections available. Keep in mind the best backup rejection(s)
 could be based on alternate embodiments from the same "best available" reference(s). For
 example, if an anticipation rejection could be overcome by invoking an exception in a
 **[37 CFR
 1.130(b)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323497)** declaration, it would be appropriate to make an
 additional obviousness rejection over another disclosure in the same reference. Merely
 cumulative rejections, i.e., those which would clearly fall if the primary rejection
 were not sustained, should be avoided. 
 


See also **[MPEP § 707.05](s707.html#d0e73405)**.
 

**II.** **RELIANCE UPON ABSTRACTS AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE DOCUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A
 REJECTION**Prior art uncovered in searching the claimed subject matter of a patent
 application often includes English language abstracts of underlying documents, such as
 technical literature or foreign patent documents which may not be in the English
 language. When both the abstract and the underlying document qualify as prior art, the
 underlying document should normally be used to support a rejection. When an abstract is
 used to support a rejection, the evidence relied upon is the facts contained in the
 abstract, not additional facts that may be contained in the underlying full text
 document. Citation of and reliance upon an abstract without citation of and reliance
 upon the underlying scientific document is generally inappropriate where both the
 abstract and the underlying document are prior art. See *Ex parte
 Jones*, 62 USPQ2d 1206, 1208 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 2001)
 (unpublished). To determine whether both the abstract and the underlying document are
 prior art, a copy of the underlying document must be obtained and analyzed. If the
 document is in a language other than English and the examiner seeks to rely on that
 document, a translation must be obtained so that the record is clear as to the precise
 facts the examiner is relying upon in support of the rejection. The record must also
 be clear as to whether the examiner is relying upon the abstract or the full text
 document to support a rejection. The rationale for this is several-fold. It is not
 uncommon for a full text document to reveal that the document fully anticipates an
 invention that the abstract renders obvious at best. The converse may also be true, that
 the full text document will include teachings away from the invention that will preclude
 an obviousness rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, when the abstract
 alone appears to support the rejection. An abstract can have a different effective
 publication date than the full text document. Because all patentability determinations
 are fact dependent, obtaining and considering full text documents at the earliest
 practicable time in the examination process will yield the fullest available set of
 facts upon which to determine patentability, thereby improving quality and reducing
 pendency. In limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the examiner to make a
 rejection in a non-final Office action based in whole or in part on the abstract only
 without relying on the full text document. In such circumstances, the full text document
 and a translation (if not in English) may be supplied in the next Office action.
 


 Examiners may rely on a machine translation of a foreign
 language document unless the machine translation is not of sufficient quality to be
 adequate evidence of the contents of the document. See *In re Orbital
 Technologies Corporation,* 603 Fed. App’x 924, 932 (Fed. Cir. 2015). A
 request by the applicant for the examiner to obtain a human language translation should
 be granted if the applicant provides evidence (e.g., a translation inconsistent with the
 machine translation) showing the machine translation does not accurately represent the
 document’s contents.
 


An Office action supplying a full text document and/or
 translation may be made final if the conditions described in **[MPEP § 706.07(a)](s706.html#d0e69118)** or
 for a first Office action or RCE, in **[MPEP § 706.07(b)](s706.html#d0e69408)**, have been met.
 


Some translation resources available to examiners are
 discussed in **[MPEP §
 901.05(d)](s901.html#d0e113207)**.
 

**III.** **DISTINCTION BETWEEN 35 U.S.C. 102 AND 103**The distinction between rejections based on **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and
 those based on **[35
 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)** should be kept in mind. Under the former, the claim is
 anticipated by the reference. No question of obviousness is present. In other words, for
 anticipation under **[35
 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, the reference must teach every aspect of the claimed
 invention either explicitly or impliedly. Any feature not directly taught must be
 inherently present. Whereas, in a rejection based on **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**, the reference
 teachings must somehow be modified in order to meet the claims. The modification must be
 one which would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art before the
 effective filing date of the claimed invention for applications or patents subject to
 the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA or at the time the invention was made
 for applications or patents subject to pre-AIA law. See **[MPEP §§ 2131](s2131.html#d0e202959)** -
 **[2146](s2146.html#d0e213206)** and **[2150](s2150.html#ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e)** -
 **[2159.04](s2159.html#ch2100_d222e3_140d7_1bb)** for guidance on patentability determinations under
 **[35 U.S.C.
 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** and **[103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.
 



# 2120.01 Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) and (a)(2)
 and Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a), (b), or (e): Printed Publication or Patent [R-10.2019]


Once the examiner conducts a search and finds a printed publication or
 patent which discloses the claimed invention, the examiner should determine whether the
 rejection should be made under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) or (a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or, if
 the application is subject to the former prior art regime, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a), (b), or
 (e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**. See **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** for guidance. Form
 paragraph **[7.03.aia](#fp7.03.aia)** or **[7.03.fti](#fp7.03.fti)** should be used in an Office
 action to indicate whether the application is being examined under the first inventor to
 file provisions of the AIA or the pre-AIA prior art provisions, respectively.
 


# ¶ 7.03.aia Application Examined Under AIA First Inventor to File
 Provisions


The present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being
 examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * This form paragraph should be used in any application subject to
 the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA.



# ¶ 7.03.fti Application Examined Under First to Invent
 provisions


The present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being
 examined under the pre-AIA first to invent provisions. 
 


### Examiner Note:

 * This form paragraph should be used in any application filed
 on or after March 16, 2013 that is subject to the pre-AIA prior art provisions.



In order to determine which paragraph of **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 applies, the effective filing date of the application and each claimed invention must be
 determined and compared with the date of the reference. See **[MPEP §
 2139.01](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_12530_2b6)** regarding determination of effective filing date of
 the claimed invention under pre-AIA law and **[MPEP §
 2152.01](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1afb3_e6)** regarding determination of effective filing date of
 the claimed invention under AIA law.
 


The examiner must also determine the issue or publication
 date of the reference so that a proper comparison between the application and reference
 dates can be made. See **[MPEP §§ 2124](s2124.html#d0e202094)**, **[2126](s2126.html#d0e202195)**, **[2128](s2128.html#d0e202564)** -
 **[2128.02](s2128.html#d0e202804)**, and **[2152.02](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1d66c_1e5)**
 - **[2154.02(c)](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_145f0_210)** for case law relevant to reference date
 determination.
 


See **[MPEP § 2152.05](s2152.html#ch2100_d2c184_13c9f_236)** for determining whether
 to apply **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) or (a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)**. See **[MPEP §
 2139.02](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_125d3_2ef)** for determining whether to apply **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a), (b), or
 (e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. 
 


In all applications, an applicant may overcome a **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 rejection by persuasively arguing that the claims are patentably distinguishable from
 the prior art, or by amending the claims to patentably distinguish over the prior art.
 Additional ways available to overcome a rejection based on **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 prior art depend on whether or not any claim in the application being examined is

 35 U.S.C. 102(a) or (b): Knowledge by Others, or Public Use, or On Sale [R-10.2019]


An applicant may make an admission, or submit evidence of sale of the
 invention or knowledge of the invention by others, or the examiner may have personal
 knowledge that the invention was sold by applicant or known by others. See
 **[MPEP §§
 2152.02(c)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1e416_252)**-**[2152.02(e)](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_228c0_21c)** for a discussion of when public use of a claimed
 invention, placing a claimed invention on sale, or otherwise making a claimed invention
 available to the public might preclude patentability under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**. See **[MPEP §§ 2132](s2132.html#d0e203390)** and **[2133.03](s2133.html#d0e203781)***et seq.* for a discussion of when public knowledge, public use, or
 sale of a claimed invention might preclude patentability under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) or
 (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. If the activity is by an entity other than the inventors or
 assignee, such as sale by another, manufacture by another or disclosure of the invention
 by applicant to another then both **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) and (b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** may
 be applicable. If the evidence only points to knowledge within the year prior to the
 effective filing date then **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** applies.
 However, no rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)** should be
 made if there is evidence that applicant made the invention and only disclosed it to
 others within the year prior to the effective filing date. 
 


Note that as an aid to resolving public use or on sale issues, as well
 as to other related matters of public availability or public knowledge, an applicant may
 be required to answer specific questions posed by the examiner and to explain or
 supplement any evidence of record. See **[35 U.S.C. 132](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187)** and **[37 CFR
 1.104(a)(2)](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322124)**. Information sought should be restricted to that which is
 reasonably necessary for the examiner to render a decision on patentability. The
 examiner may consider making a requirement for information under  **[37 CFR 1.105](mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322262)**
 where the evidence of record indicates reasonable necessity. See **[MPEP § 704.10](s704.html#d0e55758)***et seq.*


A 2-month time period should be set by the examiner for any reply to the
 requirement, unless the requirement is part of an Office action having a shortened
 statutory period, in which case the period for reply to the Office action will also
 apply to the requirement. If applicant fails to reply in a timely fashion to a
 requirement for information, the application will be regarded as abandoned.
 **[35 U.S.C.
 133](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303207aia)**. 
 


If there is not enough information on which to base a public use or on
 sale rejection, the examiner should make a requirement for more information. Form
 paragraph **[7.104.aia](#fp7.104.aia)** or **[7.104.fti](#fp7.104.fti)** can be used.
 


# ¶ 7.104.aia Requirement for Information, Public Use or Sale or Other Public
 Availability


An issue of public use, on sale activity, or other public
 availability has been raised in this application. In order for the examiner to properly
 consider patentability of the claimed invention under **[35 U.S.C.
 102(a)(1)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)**, additional information regarding this issue is required as
 follows: **[1]**


Applicant is reminded that failure to fully reply to this

 and Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a), (b), or (e): Printed Publication or Patent [R-10.2019]


Once the examiner conducts a search and finds a printed publication or
 patent which discloses the claimed invention, the examiner should determine whether the
 rejection should be made under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) or (a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_307)** or, if
 the application is subject to the former prior art regime, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a), (b), or
 (e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302391)**. See **[MPEP § 2159](s2159.html#ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd)** for guidance. Form
 paragraph **[7.03.aia](#fp7.03.aia)** or **[7.03.fti](#fp7.03.fti)** should be used in an Office
 action to indicate whether the application is being examined under the first inventor to
 file provisions of the AIA or the pre-AIA prior art provisions, respectively.
 


# ¶ 7.03.aia Application Examined Under AIA First Inventor to File
 Provisions


The present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being
 examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA.
 


### Examiner Note:

 * This form paragraph should be used in any application subject to
 the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA.



# ¶ 7.03.fti Application Examined Under First to Invent
 provisions


The present application, filed on or after March 16, 2013, is being
 examined under the pre-AIA first to invent provisions. 
 


### Examiner Note:

 * This form paragraph should be used in any application filed
 on or after March 16, 2013 that is subject to the pre-AIA prior art provisions.



In order to determine which paragraph of **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 applies, the effective filing date of the application and each claimed invention must be
 determined and compared with the date of the reference. See **[MPEP §
 2139.01](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_12530_2b6)** regarding determination of effective filing date of
 the claimed invention under pre-AIA law and **[MPEP §
 2152.01](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1afb3_e6)** regarding determination of effective filing date of
 the claimed invention under AIA law.
 


The examiner must also determine the issue or publication
 date of the reference so that a proper comparison between the application and reference
 dates can be made. See **[MPEP §§ 2124](s2124.html#d0e202094)**, **[2126](s2126.html#d0e202195)**, **[2128](s2128.html#d0e202564)** -
 **[2128.02](s2128.html#d0e202804)**, and **[2152.02](s2152.html#ch2100_d20033_1d66c_1e5)**
 - **[2154.02(c)](s2154.html#ch2100_d20034_145f0_210)** for case law relevant to reference date
 determination.
 


See **[MPEP § 2152.05](s2152.html#ch2100_d2c184_13c9f_236)** for determining whether
 to apply **[35
 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) or (a)(2)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)**. See **[MPEP §
 2139.02](s2139.html#ch2100_d2c184_125d3_2ef)** for determining whether to apply **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a), (b), or
 (e)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**. 
 


In all applications, an applicant may overcome a **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 rejection by persuasively arguing that the claims are patentably distinguishable from
 the prior art, or by amending the claims to patentably distinguish over the prior art.
 Additional ways available to overcome a rejection based on **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**
 prior art depend on whether or not any claim in the application being examined is
 subject to the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA. 
 


See **[MPEP § 2152.06](s2152.html#ch2100_d2c184_13ec5_303)** for overcoming a
