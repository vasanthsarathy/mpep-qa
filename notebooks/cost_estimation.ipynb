Even if a claimed invention qualifies as eligible subject\\n matter under **[35\\n U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**, it must also satisfy the other conditions and\\n requirements of the patent laws, including the requirements for novelty\\n (**[35 U.S.C.\\n 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**), nonobviousness (**[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**), and adequate\\n description and definite claiming (**[35 U.S.C. 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**). *Bilski\\n v. Kappos,* 561 U.S. 593, 602, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1006 (2010). Therefore,\\n examiners should avoid focusing on only issues of patent-eligibility under\\n **[35 U.S.C.\\n 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** to the detriment of considering an application for\\n compliance with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**,\\n and **[35 U.S.C.\\n 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, and should avoid treating an application solely on the\\n basis of patent-eligibility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)** except in the most\\n extreme cases. \\n \\n\\n**IV.** **EVALUATE APPLICATION FOR COMPLIANCE WITH 35 U.S.C. 112*** \\n\\n***A.*** ***Determine Whether the Claimed Invention Complies with 35 U.S.C. 112(b)\\n or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Second Paragraph Requirements*** **[35 U.S.C.\\n 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** contains two separate and distinct requirements: (A)\\n that the claim(s) set forth the subject matter the inventor or a joint inventor\\n regards as the invention, and (B) that the claim(s) particularly point out and\\n distinctly claim the invention. An application will be deficient under the first\\n requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** when evidence\\n outside the application as filed, e.g., admissions, shows that the inventor or a\\n joint inventor regards the invention to be different from what is claimed (see\\n **[MPEP ยง\\n 2171](s2171.html#d0e217389)** - **[MPEP ยง 2172.01](s2172.html#d0e217526)**). \\n \\n\\n\\nAn application fails to comply with the second\\n requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)** when the claims\\n do not set out and define the invention with a reasonable degree of precision and\\n particularity. In this regard, the definiteness of the language must be analyzed, not\\n in a vacuum, but always in light of the teachings of the disclosure as it would be\\n interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art.

The fact that experimentation is complex, however, will not make\\n it undue if a person of skill in the art routinely engages in such\\n experimentation. \\n \\n\\n\\nSee **[MPEP ยง 2164](s2164.html#d0e215224)***et seq.* for detailed guidance with regard to the enablement\\n requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**.\\n \\n\\n**3.** **Best Mode**Determining compliance with the best mode\\n requirement requires a two-prong inquiry:\\n \\n\\n\\n* (1) at the time the application was filed, did\\n the inventor possess a best mode for practicing the invention; and\\n* (2) if the inventor did possess a best mode,\\n does the written description disclose the best mode in such a manner that a\\n person of ordinary skill in the art could practice the best mode.\\n\\n\\nSee **[MPEP ยง 2165](s2165.html#d0e216924)***et seq.* for additional guidance. Deficiencies related to\\n disclosure of the best mode for carrying out the claimed invention are not usually\\n encountered during examination of an application because evidence to support such\\n a deficiency is seldom in the record. *Fonar Corp. v.

Once differences are identified between the claimed invention\\n and the prior art, those differences must be assessed and resolved in light of the\\n knowledge possessed by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Against this backdrop, one\\n must determine whether the invention would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in\\n the art. If not, the claimed invention satisfies **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**.\\n \\n\\n**VI.** **CLEARLY COMMUNICATE FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND THEIR BASES**Once examiners have completed the above analyses of the\\n claimed invention under all the statutory provisions, including **[35 U.S.C. 101](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376)**,\\n **[35 U.S.C.\\n 112](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824)**, **[35 U.S.C. 102](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383)**, and **[35 U.S.C. 103](mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450)**,\\n they should review all the proposed rejections and their bases to confirm that a\\n *prima facie* case of unpatentability exists.
