# MPEP-QA

Ask questions about the Manual of Patent Examination and Procedure (MPEP)

This tool aims to make the [MPEP](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/index.html) (Manual of Patent Examination and Procedure) more accessible to everyone. The MPEP is what guides patent examiners at the US Patent and Trademark Office ([USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/)) when they examine patent applications. It is also what guides patent lawyers and patent agents when preparing patent applications for their clients.

MPEP-QA uses OpenAI's GPT models and thus you must enter your API key below. The tool is under active development and costs some money if you run it - About $0.10 - $0.20 per question.
